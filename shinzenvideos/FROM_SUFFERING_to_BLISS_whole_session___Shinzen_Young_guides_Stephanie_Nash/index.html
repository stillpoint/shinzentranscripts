<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Okay, so you mentioned you wanted to work on some specific issues. Anything you'd like to just tell me briefly about those issues before we start to work in terms of what it is and what your goals would be in working on it? Yeah, what I'm working with now is a strong feel component that has, you might call it touch, I sometimes call it secondary feel, but that tension that comes around the feel can lock into quite a dramatic degree. When it first arose, it seemed triggered by external event, but what I, it's a response, an emotional response to an event, but I think it became clear that as I processed it, that it kind of worked as a magnet to draw years, who knows what other stuff up with it that matched that emotional frequency. And then for a while now, several days, I've been working with it. I let go of there having to be any talk image component. And it's just a huge amount of feel which I have techniques and ability to process, but it's quite a significant event. And I thought, ah, time to call in the big guns. And I thought you could help me with this and maybe someone could benefit from that help. Let me ask some questions so I can make sure I understand the situation. You're having a lot of emotional type body sensation, what I call feel. But I think that you're saying that you have a muscle tension reaction to that feel when it arises. When, I think there's a very, very strong feel and because it is so nonstop and intense that the body just starts to tighten around it in a way that I'm working not only with the feel, but I have to kind of work with the tightening that comes around it. And so I might work with one, then work with the other, but there's no question the core, it's feel. And everything else is just because it's been so intense for so long, the body's just starting to, and I'm literally now experiencing physiological things in the body just simply from that tightening around the feel. Does that make sense? Yes. And so you want to work with this sensory phenomenon, the underlying emotional sensations or feel as we would put it in the technical vocabulary, body sensation that seems emotional. And then there's a kind of physical response in the form of muscle tension. And that muscle tension, some people consider that to be a purely physical sensation. But because it's so linked with the emotion, some people consider it to be in and of itself an emotional sensation. We can parse it either way depending on what's natural for that person. I have a few other questions to ask you. It sounds to me like you've already been working with it in the way that I would consider optimal. By that I mean that you're sometimes focusing on the tension reaction, sometimes focusing on the underlying feel itself, which is the general strategy of divine and conquer. And I've been using a lot of, you know, flow is probably where my natural strength is. And so, and I can work with flow and almost immediately have some kind of response to that of going into it. But then it re-arises and re-congeals so I thought, okay, I've got to maybe work more deeply or maybe you can just help me. Probably, the strategies that you are using are already optimal. That's my guess. It's simply a matter of continuing with them. But let's just do some interactive stuff and we'll see what comes up. I'm not sure that there's actually anything new to add content-wise. It may just be a numbers game of continuing what you're now doing. But like I say, let's see what happens. I do have a couple more questions. Does the tension reaction that you're referring to, does that tend to come up in a pronounced pattern in real time or is it more of an ongoing sort of situation? By that I mean, is there a clear sense of there'll be an eruption of feel and then there's a tension, eruption of feel, then there's tension? Or is it that the tension is sort of there in a fairly ongoing way? Or does it tend to fluctuate moment by moment with the fluctuations in the feel? A little bit of the second, a little bit of the third. The feel is pretty continuous, pretty intense, but there is a rising and falling depending on if I'm able to give it, if I'm able to stop and go into it, sometimes it might multiply in effect times 10 and become quite more than what you wanted to deal with, but I'm assuming that's a part of the process. Sometimes my work with it will help it flow. The tension does not correspond directly to the feel and what I'm calling the tension is just from the feel having been so consistent, there's a kind of a not breathing and a tensing in that's creating stuff in the back. So it's not really a moment by moment physical muscle tensing around emotional body sensation. It's more the result that the emotional body sensations have been ongoing for so long that you're getting this secondary sensation. Okay, now let me ask some other questions. You talk about the feel breaking up into flow and I'm assuming that happens with some consistency? You know, whenever I focus in on it, yes. How about the tension reaction? Does it break up into flow? If I'm focusing towards that, yes. That can break up into flow as well. They all do kind of like a rubber band snap back into place a lot. It just feels like there's just been a momentum of... Okay, they break up into flow but then they can re-solidify. So you can actually have the tension and the feel both turn into flow with your practice. Have you attempted to do that during practice in motion like walking practice and so forth? Pretty much, yes. I have to, otherwise I wouldn't be able to function. I wouldn't be doing this today if I wasn't. So you can already get them both to dissolve into flow which is pretty amazing. But when I'm doing an action, in other words if I'm stopping and all of my awareness is going into that, I can go total flow. But when I have to also do this activity or talk to this person or do something like that, all of my attention isn't on it. So there's some congealing. I can do enough flow to function but I'm not floating on clouds all the way through. I do have periods where something like there's certain activities that help the flow. So when I'm doing a laughing meditation or when I'm facilitating somebody, I literally don't, it pretty much all goes flow during certain activities. But the rest of the time it's having to kind of keep some awareness there and some awareness here just to kind of function. A couple more questions, which is the source of the greatest distress? Is it the feel or the tension reaction? The feel, absolutely. So you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension reaction? Oh that'll go when the feel... So the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation. Absolutely. And I think that helps me hone in a little bit more on what our target should be. Have you attempted, well I should say as you know, a basic principle in mindfulness is divide and conquer. Case in point, you have divided this experience into, okay there's the emotional body sensations, that's one component, then there's the muscle reactions to those, that's the second component. So that's already a divide and conquer and that has already given you some relief that the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances. As you remember, a second axiom is if divide and conquer doesn't work, remember what I always say, subdivide until you do conquer. In this case, have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors, anger, fear, sadness, in other words, have you applied the... Noting feeling flavors. Noting feeling flavor technique to this intense arising. Yes, I have. What I have found to be more helpful is the investigating where exactly I'm feeling what. Okay, it's a clenching here, what are the boundaries, is there more pressure in, is it pushing out, you know, am I coming down. The more I'm kind of investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality, that's been a little more successful in helping me go through it. But I can tell you the quality. The subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the quality, which is the noting feel flavors, so that gives you the spectrum, anger, fear, sadness, interest, what have you. But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. So then that would be like... You want to stop for one second? No, let's just let it go. Okay. It could happen during a real session. So you can subdivide into flavors, but you can also subdivide into locations. So it's an application of the same principle. So you're saying that subdividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive. Yeah, location and quality of sensation. You mean, so it's a little of both? Yes. Flavor and location, you're getting specific about those. So you've already made the major thing that I would first try, okay, because you've internalized the algorithm so well, and you say that that does help. Do you note the location, like with the location word, face? No, I haven't been doing that out loud. But you've been tracking the location, and then it sounds like you're staying up for a little while in a location. And moving my awareness around inside of it. Inventory, and see what it's like. When I'm inside of it, it's so much easier than when I'm outside of it, for me. So that, once again, sounds like a pretty optimal strategy. Tell me, what are the range of flavors involved? It's primarily a fear flavor, primarily to an almost terror panic. Intense fear? Intense fear, and there's absolutely sadness. There's absolutely... Fear and sadness. Yeah. Is there a reason for it, or is it just erupting in the body? Like I said, I think there was an event or two that triggered it on the outside, but this was out of proportion to that, and I saw that. And as I worked with it, I found that the particular story, the surface story... I even knew, it was silly. But as I let go of there needing to be a story, I kind of just went into this huge feel. And as I've gone down in layers, I'm seeing kind of flickers of like, oh, fear of annihilation, that I'll be killed in any moment. There's not a logical thing to this. Yeah, right. In other words, it's not really coming from the object of external or... I think it tapped, I think whatever this was on the outside... The pool of fear. It tapped everything like a magnet, I think it drew everything up that resonated at that frequency, and it's just kind of really thrown me at how huge it is. And they say in Ohio, huge, you're supposed to say huge. But really, it's taken all my technique or skill to be functioning. Okay. So we're having a huge upwelling of fear potential and it sounds like sadness. Yeah, there's sadness. And are they equally strong, the fear and the sadness? I'd say the fear is probably, it's probably like the fear is the cake and the sadness is icing that's also going down through the cake. I get it. To use a food analogy. Actually, that's probably a pretty accurate description because that's what happens, they tangle and interact. And you say very little mental image or internal talk accompanying this. At first there was a lot, but as I go down... It's almost pure body. How about very subtle image or talk activation, subliminal, a hint of something? The subliminal stuff is where that annihilation came up. Okay, that is starting to suggest some strategies. Let me ask you further. I say annihilation, but the thing that comes up would be killed, like anybody at any moment could kill me. Yeah, yeah. It's phobic. It's fear. And this is good. You've heard me a million times talk about how before we break through these things, they need to become, my phrase is, continuous and ubiquitous. Continuous means unbroken in time, ubiquitous means everywhere in the body. We're going towards that. If that's happening, then a process of permanent purification is happening. People, of course, are averse to the notion of letting something like fear or sadness become continuous through time and omnidirectional in the body, ubiquitous through the body. But that's penny wise and pound foolish, because being unwilling to pass through that temporarily keeps them always with the sort of Damocles of fear hanging over their head, and likewise with the other negatives like sadness, anger, and so forth. So you have to reach a point where it's completely irrational, completely over the top intense, doesn't stop in time, and is in every cubic centimeter of your body, if not of the known universe, in other words, perceived as larger than the body. And say, okay, I would allow this to go on forever. It's at that point that you're getting optimal catharsis, in the sense of cleaning out. So it's taking a while, but I'm getting a clearer picture of what's going on. Just hearing you say that makes me feel better. You know, I mean, I still want to work, but it's kind of just helpful to have somebody say, because I've just been working on it by myself without talking to anyone, and it's very helpful to hear it. It's just helpful to hear that, you know. Yeah, I would say that this is the stage before people become free. It's interesting too, because when I had a physical issue a year ago, where I had excruciating pain in my body, what happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned, was singeing, very hot. And the neurologist and everybody said it was probably in response to the pain. They said it's just your body's into an alarm alert mode. That's getting activated by this fear. So like I have that in addition, so you're talking about hot, you know. I've got that on the outside, this kind of singeing, and that will definitely, that directly corresponds with the intensity of the feeling. So that's enough, isn't it? It's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information. Do you think that it's interacting with subtle levels of talk or image? Very very subtle, subliminal. What do you mean, interacting? By that I mean that the fear and sadness might be intensified by subtle subliminal activations of visual or auditory thinking. What I think is happening, and this is just having been working with it now for a while, I think it's like if there's a deck of cards that's all the images and thoughts that we have in a pool, that one hit something and it went down, and if there were like little shavings of metal, I'm sorry, I went back away from deck of cards, little shavings, all of those came up, and each one of those is an image or it could be image or talk stuff, but it's just like, and so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be enough to go, oh yes, that's when I was fired. That's exactly what I mean by that. And when that comes up, it can poke, it can, it can, it can kind of like add a little bit of a wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might poke in the feel a little bit, but if I stay with the feel, they just kind of hang out. So the answer to the question is yes, there is interaction with subtle image, which is significant and also characteristic of catharsis, although it may primarily come up as body feel flavors, subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the gestalt, especially the visual, because people don't usually hear hell, they usually see hell, although in theory you can hear it too, but image space is where the monsters are that might be linked to all of this, so that gives me some of the more information that I need. Okay now, believe it or not, yet more questions, okay, because well, because we got to see what's really going on and I don't... You're doing your house. Yeah, well, you interviewed me. You're doing your house, MD. This is called differential diagnosis, baby. These are my huge diagnostic skills. Okay, so let's see here. Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear that was pervasive through the body so dissolved into flow that it no longer caused you suffering? Yes. How about sadness? Have you ever done that? So then you've already done what we're going to be working towards. We're going to be working towards that experience yet again, because it's a matter of, I mean basically, what, let's see, one, two, three, four, maybe there's four kinds of human beings. I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans, right? But maybe one way to classify all human beings is there's most human beings who have never had the experience of physical pain flowing so completely that it turned into a flavor of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. Most humans have never had that experience, okay? So that's most humans. Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once, okay? Then there are the humans that have had that same experience but with regards to rage, terror, or grief. That's a whole other thing than physical pain in terms of what it's like when that breaks up. So we've determined that- And I think harder. Incomparably harder. Because pain is just pain. The emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and distort us. They've been honed by evolution for that task. That's what hell is. Hell is rage, terror, grief, shame flavors that have become so activated that they're able to convince you that not only will this be all you ever experience from now on, they're actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else. They have that much distorting power so that it seems like eternal in both directions. That would be hell. Purgatory is when you've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that illusion anymore but they're still there and you're working with them. The threshold between purgatory and heaven is when it turns into flow that we've been talking about. So believe it or not, one other question. Besides fear and sadness, are there hints of any other flavors in there? Like anger or shame specifically. I actually look specifically for them. I think the shame flavor can, like if something happens in the extra world that embarrasses me, I feel that shame and that can trigger all this. You know, it's irrational. Is it part of the present gestalt, the shame flavor, or is it pretty much we're dealing with sad and had? If we call fear had. Just for alliteration, I couldn't resist. I know, I didn't go for it. Because there's mad, sad, glad and had. You're changing my feel favors here. Don't worry, we'll get back to hell soon. Here's what's interesting. You know that heat I talked about in the body? It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flesh. And so it can trigger it. So they all kind of interlinked in that way. It's all information that I need to do the guidance. Let's do it. Okay. Okay. So take a moment to stretch up and settle in and focus for just a second on physical relaxation into the posture. Okay, we're going to start by working in the fierce sad system. So at any given instant, there'll be exactly one of four states. Just fear, just sad, both or neither. We're going to ignore everything else. We're just going to penetrate that one system of affective somesthesia. My way of talking make sense? Well, until the last two words. I know what you meant. I know. That's Greco-Roman for emotional type body sensation. Thank you. I love it though. I know. So I'd like you to note fear, sad, fear and sad, or none. One of those four. You want fear and sad or both? Let's use fear and sad with a Boolean and operation. So we'll get the four logically possible states of the fierce sadness system. Any questions about that? Okay, good. Out loud? Yeah, for starters. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Fear and sad. Okay, good. Now go to mental labels. Thinking the labels rather than speaking them. Okay. Is it still mostly both at the same time? Yes. Okay, good. Now we're going to work just with the fear. I'm assuming that there is one or more areas of local intensity for the fear. Is that correct? Yes. Is it one or are there several disconnected? There's probably one primary one that spreads out and has little branches to it. And then there's a little bit of a journey to a secondary one for the most part. Okay. So the primary one spreads branches. How broadly? The primary one is right at the center of my chest, like right in between my rib cage. How broadly are the branches spread through the body? It kind of comes down around to the side and in there, but it kind of spreads out a bit like the core, the center is kind of there in a kind of big odd shape. And then there are ways in which I think it kind of reaches subtly, like subtle veins kind of going out around to the middle of my back. Okay. Excellent detection skill. I'm assuming that the subtler ramifications are of less intensity? Absolutely. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to just work with fear. Each time you note sad, I would like you to zoom out to the subtle ramifications, focus on them only. Every time I note sad? I'm sorry, every time you note fear. Go out to the subtle ramifications and work towards perfect equanimity with those subtle sensations because they're subtle, it may be possible to have complete openness with them even though you can't do so with the local intensities that are at the epicenter of it. So we're going to use the zoom out option on the noting. You're going to zoom out to cover the subtle spread and work towards perfect equanimity with that. And don't concern yourself with the local splash at the center at all. Just with the global ripple in a rhythm with the mental labels of fear. The word fear. Any questions about that? No. You want me... I'll just repeat it back. I'm zooming out. I'm going to keep noting fear with mental labels, but I'm going to, when I note fear, zoom out to the subtler tributaries, so to speak, of the experience of fear in my body, not tuning into the big main Grand Central Station part of it. That's perfect. Okay. And yes, and by mental label I mean think to word fear to indicate that that's the flavor. And then you zoom out. And then I'm just going to have you do that on your own for a few minutes. Okay. And then I'm going to have you do that on your own for a few minutes. Able to do that pretty good? Yeah. Is there any hint of flow in the global spread of the fear? Oh, yeah. It's pretty fluid? Yeah, it flows. It's interesting. I tend to be flowy in general, but when I worked with this, it would... At first I got little hits of nausea. Like I started to feel a little nausea. Other flavors. Yeah. And then a little ticklish, but if I just kind of kept with it, those would just... You know, if I just kind of just stayed with them. Yes, they dissipate. So you're able to get the global component in the fear flavor to flow. Yeah. Okay. Can that flow spread into the local intensity so that you get a local global flow with the fear? You know, I think I started to naturally start to do that, and I think that's when the nausea started to... I think my body... Okay, let's go for local global flow now. So that means you'll remember that there's, in my standard formulation of the noting technique, you remember zoom in, zoom out, zoom both ways. So we're going to zoom both ways, out to the perimeter, to the weak sensations there, and ride the momentum of the flow that's there, and simultaneously zoom into the core intensity and see if you can get them to get that local splash, global ripple. While keeping the zooming, so simultaneously... Yeah, you're zooming in and out, into the core, out to the perimeter, and you're doing that precisely to facilitate the spread of the global flow into the local intensity. So the awareness is moving in and out. In and out at the same time. You have a phrase that you came up with. Sliding. You're going to slide in both ways. You're going to slide out with your awareness and let it facilitate a global circulation of fear, and you're going to slide in and let that facilitate a local circulation of fear. So you get both the intense areas and the peripheral areas as a single fear flow. Able to get a little sense of that? Oh yeah. So that's a catharsis, a releasing of fear. It creates this kind of center of this, it's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the center, but then I get really hot. Yeah, let the joy be there, let the heat be there. These are all reactions to the catharsis. And if the heat produces more fear, then just dissipate that in the fear. Except that we're going to let go of the fear now and go to the sadness. Have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do. Same procedure, start with the periphery of the sadness flavor. Work with that. See if it's amenable through a zoom out process to an experience of a global flow in the sadness. If that's feasible, do that, and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter, and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness, if indeed that's sort of doable at this time. I'd like you to explore the doability of that with regards to sadness. Just give it some time. Ever able to get a little hint of that? Yeah. Since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread, I just kind of instead of, since I didn't quite have the subtle area, I just went around the boundaries of it. That's exactly correct. That corresponds to the subtle. It's just less widespread. That was a good move. I just made the boundaries soft and then treated that like... That's right. That's what I would have had you do. So you're able to get a little sense of that. Yeah. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to have you do a fairly intricate concentration, where you're going to attempt to experience simultaneously a kind of river of fear and a kind of river of sad that flow through each other, interpenetrating without interfering. So it's almost like... Could you say that again? Oh yeah. Right. There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like giant liquid drop that's sort of expanding and contracting, right? Right. And there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same essential dance. Right. Now, you know how in a ghost movie, you see that the ghost can walk through the wall, right? Right. The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. Right. Now, imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing each other. Right. When they occupied the same place at the same time. So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavor sad. And they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all of them can occupy the same place. So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. Does this metaphor make sense? Yeah. Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? Not in this, not this round. This may be the part of the missing piece because you could get them individually to flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow. Because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering, then they won't multiply together into overwhelm. And so the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. Through each other. It's an interesting. In this ghostly dance. It's an interesting intimacy between them. Yeah. It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. Okay, good. How's that coming? Good. Good. Good in what sense? When I can allow them both to share the same space and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping that line between them and when I allow them to just kind of do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, it's a very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot. So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. Yes, I am. Which most people would say is rather counterintuitive, but your facial expression proves it. Yeah. Okay, good. It's really interesting though because as it does, I find myself wanting to comment on it and I'll go off and talk and then it loses it a little bit. Yeah, and you have to come back. It's got to be done purely in the budget. It's because the comments and then, you know... It does trigger some little topics to go, this is all about it. That's right, but your use of practice allows you to stop that and not sort of go down in that. Yeah, well plus there's motivation to kind of stay with this. It's intrinsically rewarding. Now next step, see if you can have the fear and the sadness dancing with and through each other with your eyes open. And you may find defocusing the eyes initially helpful. So we can maintain it somewhat into a more ordinary experience. It's interesting when I am, as I kind of go in and out here as I do it, and I'm going to talk while keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm honing in on the one specific place in the body they both share in a powerful way. And if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's the red or blue, you know, it kind of helps me maintain it with my eyes open more. Good. Now see if you can keep some contact with that even after we make some eye contact. It may be a little trickier, but this is what we just did here is probably one of the missing pieces of the solution to the situation that you described. I'm not sure it's all of the missing pieces. I've got a few other ideas besides this. But I think for this session, one. One epiphany is worth the price of admission. A little bit of money on the table. You haven't done this before, this theme of different flavors. Interdigitation was a word you used to use. And what's so interesting is as soon as you guided me on this, I thought, I'll guide somebody else in this. But I didn't think of it for me. I was just too busy. Oh, you remembered to do this. You remember to get the flavors to do this. Oh, I have other people do this. Right, but you didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. I was just, all my circuits were just so full, I guess. Well, you know, that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach to meditation, which is that the assumption is that when people face real challenges, even people without a background in practice, if you interactively guide them, will be able to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently. Dramatic, positive experiences. It has also been my experience that people that are quite good at meditation, when they're faced with real life challenges, can easily forget. But all you need is somebody to do this. And it's like, oh yeah, I knew how to do that. And then now you're set. This is one session. We don't need 20 years of therapy here. It's like, okay, now you sort of know what to do. So I think that's excellent. But I will, for subsequent sessions, remind me that I had some other ideas of, well I can actually just tell you. Just tell me now and then I can always replay it and go, remember you had this and this. So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well, the two flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other. Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking. And you might want to look in that direction. And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special exercise that, with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but I'll ask you. Have we ever done noting feel sources? What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. No, we haven't done that. We've mentioned fear, I call that noting feel sources. And feel can be generic or specific. That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this, because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering from other senses that are activating the fear in real time. And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? How much of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates? Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, specifically what's triggering what. And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, or emotion in general, but especially fear, literally a few minutes of noting what is triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards talk space, no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear in the body. Now you know that the subconscious mind... I'm quite aware of having that. Yeah, the subconscious. Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to know did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, because it's got to be one of those five, that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly reduces the overwhelm.</p>
