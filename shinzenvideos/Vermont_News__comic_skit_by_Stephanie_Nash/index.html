<p>Oh, this just in. We have an on the scene live report from Melanie Mash in Burlington. Thanks, Bob. <br><br> I am here on the west side of Burlington, Vermont, just outside the forest next to Lake Champlain. A possibly homeless man who locals have reported often meanders in the very well maintained paths of the forest and is reported to go by the name the Head Chin or the Big Chin was seen drunkenly walking down the path muttering 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And he kept waving and pointing to a piece of paper with nonsensical symbols on it, muttering that it had his whole system on there and that he looked at it every day and that it was the solution to McDermott. He was in a trench coat, which he called his robes, and wearing a sign that said on the front, think dimensionally, and on the back, optimize the happy. Then he returned to this kind of spastic walking, telling the crowd that he was auto-walking and that they should try auto-thinking so that they could meet Gus. <br><br> We're not sure who Gus is, possibly an imaginary friend. Everyone assumed at this point that the man was intoxicated and then he started marching and chanting, Trump is empty, Obama is empty. And that's when a real crowd started to gather, assuming it was actually a political rally. <br><br> People wanted to join in the chant, but were confused as to which side he was on. When someone asked him, he stopped and looked at them and said, the source, and so are you, and everything is loved into existence in each moment. At which point they assumed this wasn't political after all, but that he was a religious fanatic. But then he asked if anyone had some Kickapoo joy juice, and then said that he had been abducted by aliens who did a lot of anal probing. Yes, Bob, that's when they realized he was delusional and the authorities were called. And then he returned to the counting and walking, only to stop and declare that he had no self, which had a bounciness and connectivity. And then he proceeded to say he could see, hear, and feel while waving his arms and pretending to have a theory. By this point, there was a huge crowd around him who seemed to be enjoying this display. Some were even drawn in and soon others were walking around chanting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And that's when we arrived, Bob. <br><br> And I tell you, I have never seen anything like it. I think the guy was just some kind of hypnotist. When the police arrived, they came towards him and he said he wanted to wrestle like he did with his TA when he was stoned. And that's when one officer approached him slowly saying that everything was going to be okay. To which the man said, it was more than okay. <br><br> Everything was enfolded with an expansion and contraction, which arose out of and returned to the source. Then he pointed to a garbage can and insisted he could merge with it. The officer said that he wanted the man to get into the car. And then the man, called the Big Shin, pointed to the car and said he had been in one of those, and that it had rolled over and over and slid under a semi and that was how he lost his ear. <br><br> But it wasn't a bad trip. Oh, yes, Bob, he seemed to have both his ears. The officer then asked if there were drugs involved and the Big Shin said, yes, LSD. But then he giggled and confided that no one knew. So the police officer assured him that now he knew and that they needed him to get into the car. The man asked if instead they could go on a motorcycle at 100 miles per hour with no self-driving or pretend it was an ox and ride backwards. And the officer said, no. To which the man pretended to ring a bell and then said, that car is empty. The officer then said that the empty backseat was going to be full in a moment and asked the man if he could see how many fingers he was holding up. The man then approached the officer, looked deeply into his eyes, and in a slow, meaningful way asked the officer, who is seeing? Whereupon the officer disappeared. Vanished. <br><br> I kid you not, Bob. Then the man, the Big Shin, pointed quickly and shouted, gone.
