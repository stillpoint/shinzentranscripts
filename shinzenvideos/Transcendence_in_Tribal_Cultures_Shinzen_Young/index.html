<p>Yes, in tribal cultures, this is interesting. Tribal cultures typically do not have a technical vocabulary for these kinds of things. Typically, they do not have systematic exercises. That's characteristic of literate civilizations. So, when these tribal cultures encounter the elaborate philosophical and technological cultures of the modern world, previously there had been a tendency to sort of think of themselves as being less than, because it's like, wow, all these ideas and the literate cultures foster that notion. And I don't just mean imperialistic Western culture, there's also imperialistic Chinese culture. I mean, it's a human thing, okay? But actually, it's exactly the opposite. It's actually to the credit of those tribal cultures that they didn't have techniques and didn't have concepts, in a sense. Why? Because they didn't need techniques and they didn't need concepts, they actually experienced the stuff as part of their daily life and as part of their rituals, their ceremonies. So, whereas the literate cultures had words for things but weren't necessarily actually having experiences, the tribal cultures didn't need the words or the techniques. Life and ceremony sort of did it for people. So, I would say, you know, it's not elaborated like that. Yet, having said that, look what's implied, we'll just take one example of a tribal situation, the one I'm most familiar with, which is Native American, specifically the Lakota or Western Sioux approach to things. If you sort of look at the symbolism of the ceremonies, it's all about complementary polarities. The sacred object, representative sacred object is the pipe. That pipe has a bowl made of earth and a stem made of wood. And they're kept separate. The bowl stands for Mother Earth, which is a contractive force. The stem stands for Father Sky, which is an expansive force. The tree grows up to the sky. Eventually, the bowl goes back into the earth, okay, to its source. So, you have these two, you're actually holding in your hands the fundamental forces of the universe. And when you bring them together, okay, then there's an empowering to do things. When you do the sun dance, you dance around a cottonwood tree or aspen, and they're forked like that, okay. So, it's one becoming two, becoming one. That's what you're looking at for four days. There's different ways that people get pierced. You may have seen in movies like that movie, The Man Called Horse. By the way, unlike in that movie, no one screams and cries, okay. But let's say you get pierced the way it's shown in that movie. So, you get hauled up by these skewers, and you are now completely at the mercy of an expansive force of the sky that's pulling your flesh up, the contractive force of the earth. Those forces are totally beyond what any human mind can deal with. So, you just have to surrender to that, and however long it takes for that which is caught in between the fundamental forces to give, exemplified by about a square inch of skin on either side, you just have to wait. At the moment when it breaks and you fall to the ground is when your prayer is delivered to the source. So, this sort of polarity thing is over the, symbolically it's all there. It's there in the ceremonies. I've heard one medicine person, when you start a sweat lodge, okay, you put five rocks in the center like that. So, one medicine man said that actually the original Lakota way was there was just four rocks indicating the basic, the directions, okay. And the source, God, Tonka-ashila, was represented by the absence. But because people couldn't wrap their mind around that, they ended up actually putting something there just to symbolize that. So, I could go on and on, and I'm sorry for getting digressed, but you asked about tribal cultures. I think it's there in the life, it's there in the symbolism, it's there in the ceremonies. It is not as I've ever been able to see there in terms of organized techniques or philosophical concepts, but as I say, I don't think that that represents a less than situation. I think it represents a better than situation. They didn't need that stuff. They just lived it, or at least some of them. I'm not saying all our remote ancestors were like that, but is that a sufficient answer about tribal?</p>
