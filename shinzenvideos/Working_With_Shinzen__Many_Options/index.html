<p>My name is Stephanie Nash and I am sitting here interviewing Shinzen Yung, who is an innovative meditation teacher who's come up with his own mathematical and scientific journey to zero. And we're going to be talking about a lot of things today, but before we do, I want to make sure everyone knows how to get more of you, how to access video talks of yours on the website. You have MP3s, you do retreats in person, and you also do phone based retreats. So let's just go through these and make sure we know which is which. First for your personal retreats, if someone wants to come and do a residential retreat with you, they would go to shinzen.org. That's correct. That's also a site with more than a book's worth of free article content. So that's sort of my personal site and archives of previous work that I've done. So you go to shinzen.org and look under my schedule if you want to come to an on-site program with me, or if you want to get like tons of articles. And you can also order CDs. Yes. You have a whole CD store there. But more modernly, I have an MP3 site. You are more modern now, aren't you? People would probably go there, although some people like the CDs. The MP3 site is shinzentalks.com, so you can download quite a bit there. The really convenient and really cool site is basicmindfulness.org. That's one-stop shopping for practice. Cool site. What's cool about it is all of the things that tend to get in the way of people doing this practice, which means it's hard to get instruction from somebody that you can relate to because they may not live in your area. You can't travel. You can't leave your family. You don't want to incur expenses. You don't want it to take a lot of time. There's a lot of speed bumps that get in the way of having a regular practice. Basicmindfulness.org is my attempt to get rid of those speed bumps for the world. It's one-stop shopping for practice, meaning that we run classes and very, very short micro-retreats that are telephone-based. Now, when I try to describe this to people, I always get this glazed-over, sort of quizzical look because they can't quite compute, wait, it's in my home, it's a telephone, how does this all work kind of thing. All I can say is just try it. You will see it's very intuitive. You get cheap long-distance calling. If you don't know how to do that, we've got something on the site that tells you how to get it dirt cheap. You get hands-free operation either with a headset or just a speakerphone. You're not on the telephone all the time, but you are on for interaction with me and for group discussion and for group guided. Then you hang up, you work on your own, and then you come back and you have more discussion. So all the features that would be present in a residential retreat that might extend for a week, we've economically packed into a four-hour micro-retreat situation. One thing I can say from having done this, actually, when we're on the phone, sometimes there's a greater intimacy. Sometimes on a phone when we talk to people versus in person where you're dealing with that energy. Having your voice coming in on the phone, also when I'm in my home, it brings the association of the work into my home, but it also feels quite personalized as opposed to being in a room with a lot of people. It's kind of like... There's many paradoxes. People thought, oh, it's going to destroy the sense of group energy. Well, it doesn't destroy it. It creates a different group energy, but there's still a group energy and I can't explain it, but there is. So you got that. People said, oh, well, it's in my home and in my home is where all my buttons are that I'm going to be distracted and self-indulgent. I got to go away to a center. Well, what we discovered is counterintuitively, if you do it, you can do it in your home and when you do it, sacramentalizes the home rather than polluting the retreat. Doing it in your home sacramentalizes your home and then you see that you can do it in your home. So there were many very nice counterintuitive results from this. So basically the second weekend of every month is home retreat practice weekend. We give five independent programs, at least one of which every month is an intro program requiring no previous experience in anything like this whatsoever. Meaning at any given month, anybody anywhere in the world can get started with the practice and be off and running with a technique and then next month they can come back, maybe do that same technique or learn another technique and it's all there. You just have to go to basicmindfulness.org, read how to get started. Is there written material? There's written material that has, like shinzen.org is this vast archive of stuff, but the audios and the readings at basicmindfulness.org is paired down. That's just what you need in order to get started with the practice.</p>
