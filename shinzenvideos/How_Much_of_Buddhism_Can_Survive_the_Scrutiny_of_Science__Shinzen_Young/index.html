<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Traditionally in Buddhism, there's a criterion that the Buddha gave when his students said, how can we know if something is consonant with your teaching? And that criterion is called the pavalakshana. So pava means existence, and if that sounds like the English word be, it's not a coincidence. So existence. And lakshana is a mark or characteristic. So I said, well, if you teach these three marks of existence, then that's consonant with what all the Buddhas teach. So if you're interested in these kinds of topics, it's good to actually learn the Pali. So anicca, most of you know that. Can you say it? Anicca. Anatta. Anatta. Dukkha. Dukkha. So I didn't take AHA. This is the Pali pronunciation. So dukkha is usually translated as suffering, anicca, impermanence, and anatta, no self. These are the marks of existence. So not everyone in the world thinks Buddhism is right. You can go on the internet and find all sorts of critiques and criticisms of Buddhism. So I think it's important to think very clearly about these kinds of things. If you want to be able to sort of untangle different things that people say and have productive conversations. So because I'm pretty much a logic and evidence-based guy, I tend to think of myself as a rationalist and empiricist, so I have to ask myself in all honesty, how much of that can survive the critique of science? How much of Buddhism can survive the closest scrutiny and last into this century and last for a long, long time? When I ask myself that question in a very uncensored way, it seems to me that actually quite a bit can survive, which is extraordinary when you think about it, given how old Buddhism is and so forth. I don't think it can all survive, though, the scrutiny of science, but so what? The parts that can survive are enormously useful and powerful. So time will tell. But let's begin with dukkha, the claim that suffering is, that the nature of existence is suffering. What about this will stem the scrutiny of careful investigation and what might not? Well, first off, we're a little bit hit with a problem, because a major feature in the formulation of dukkha is the assumption that we live multiple lives, that we in fact reincarnate, and that most life forms are uncomfortable. In the West, there's a tendency to find reincarnation a comforting thought. Oh, I'll be reincarnated. I'm coming back. I'm coming back. But in India, that is not a comforting thought at all. It's a scary, horrible thought, because Westerners typically always imagine that they're going to come back. Well, first of all, they imagine they have been like Egyptian princesses. I was the advisor to the king, or I was a llama in Tibet. And then the assumption is when I come back, maybe I'll be the president of the United States. But the Buddhist notion, the traditional Buddhist notion, is that pleasant incarnations are extremely rare. Someone once asked the biophysicist, one of the founders of biophysics, Hal Dane, if he could discern any characteristic of God by having studied the mathematics of biology. Some of you are laughing. His response was very funny. He said, well, apparently God has an inordinate fondness for beetles. There are more beetle species far and away than anything else. So your probability of your next thousand lives being a beetle is very high, whereas being the vizier of the pharaoh or whatever, not very probable at all. In fact, even a fairly decent life where you get a chance to hear about meditation and maybe practice it, but at least you've heard the dharma, you know what the traditional metaphor for how rare that is? Some of you do. Well, there's a bunch of ones. But there's this piece of wood that's floating in the ocean and has a little hole in it. And there is a turtle in the ocean. And the probability that when the turtle sticks his head out of the water, it will go through that exact point is the probability that you'll hear the dharma in your next lifetime. Of course, the lesson in that case is use this opportunity, okay? So part of the notion of suffering that's pretty intrinsic in traditional Buddhism and always talked about is most forms of existence are uncomfortable. And so the statement that suffering is the nature of existence is somewhat based on that notion. So is there compelling evidence that in fact we have multiple lives? Not that I can see. On the other hand, if it were to turn out that we have multiple lives, personally I would not be in the slightest surprised. Not in the slightest. If the Buddhist tradition turns out to be absolutely correct in this regard, it wouldn't surprise me at all. But that's not really the same as compelling evidence. You know, Carl Sagan's thing about extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Now, does it, is it, how can I put it, does it make, can I understand why someone would think we reincarnate? Absolutely. Because, remember, I've talked several times about these states where you appreciate the full extent of what happens in the deep mind moment by moment, even when you're just processing ordinary sensory experience. The deep mind in the limit spreads out to encompass this and as far as I can see, all conceivable worlds. It points to that. I'm not saying it literally contains that. But it's a mandala and it's like a fractal and it just, as you sort of look down into that, where it's pointing to is all worlds. And it is, this is called the experience of boundless consciousness. And it's part of the jhana system. But it's nothing mystical schmistical. It's something you can access just by observing image space very, very carefully, very, very deeply. And it's, you are that, okay? That's all in each of us. And it's very easy to identify with any particular part of that and say, oh yeah, I, you know, I'm that part, I'm that part, because we're all of it. So meditators, people that have looked deeply within, it's not surprising that they would come up with the notion of, well, you jump from life to life based on your behavior, et cetera, et cetera. So it's not an insignificant perception, and to come to the point where you have that kind of awareness, that depth of contact with how the visual mind works is a very significant stage in practice. However, is that hard-nosed evidence that in fact we reincarnate? Can we show scientists compelling evidence whereby they must accept this doctrine? Not yet. Maybe someday. Maybe never. Now, maybe it's a little shocking to you to hear someone who works within the Buddhist tradition sort of say something like this, but I've been on stage with the Dalai Lama of Tibet, like closer to him than I am to St. Pan right now, and heard him say, if science should someday prove that in fact there is no reincarnation, then we have to modify Buddhism to match that. That's the Dalai Lama of Tibet, whose entire power base is predicated on this entire system, okay? So, you know, if you want a gripe, don't come to me. He's got my back. Thank God. Thank Gama Lungi De Svara. I don't know if you ever see him. Now, why bother saying something like this? Well, the reason is because I think a lot can survive the scrutiny of science, and that's important. That's like really important for the future of humanity. So, what about this notion that the nature of suffering, the existence is by nature suffering? To me it's contentious to predicate that on the belief that we reincarnate and that pleasant lives are very rare. However, let's see what we can say that more or less is not contentious, that no one would disagree with. To what extent is suffering the nature of existence? Well, one of the things that you learn with this practice is that although pain is unavoidable, physical and emotional pain are unavoidable, suffering is in fact optional. Suffering is what happens when you experience pain without skill. When you have an incomplete experience of pain, it's suffering. To the extent that you start to bring concentration, clarity, and of course equanimity, major factor, to that extent the pain becomes more poignant and less problematic, it still motivates and directs. It doesn't drive and distort. It's part of the richness of being a human, but it does not haul our existence. So, when you look around and you realize that suffering is optional and then you look at how much suffering there is, you realize that an enormous amount of what people go through from the intrapsychic to the interpersonal to the international level and intercommunity level in between, there is an enormous amount of absolutely avoidable suffering going on. And that's, I think, that gives credence to this view that certainly the nature of existence for people that don't work hard on themselves entails an enormous amount of suffering. So, I think that stands the test of logic and evidence. And it's important to know. It's like hugely important to know. So, there's that. There's also something else. The Buddhist tradition says that even pleasant things are unpleasant, which seems, maybe doesn't, does not seem to ring true to people. But it's all a matter of, it's relative, I guess might be one way to put it. What people call pleasurable, relative to the experience of complete pleasure, is actually painful. It's slightly uncomfortable. But you don't realize that until you start to have experiences of complete pleasure. What most people seek in pleasure is intensity, duration, and variety. Not actually that there's anything wrong with those things. But there's another dimension, which is not the dimension of any of those three, intensity and variety or duration. There's another dimension, which is how fully you experience the pleasure, which is measured by how much concentration, clarity, and equanimity you bring to the pleasure. And once you start to have some experiences that are starting to approach pure pleasure, pleasure unalloyed with craving and aversion and gaps in awareness and unconsciousness, pure pleasure is actually pure fulfillment. And relative to that, when you look back at, quote, ordinary experiences of pleasure that you had as a non-meditator or in the early years of your practice, there's a kind of coagulation and tension around it that is subtly painful. So this is not obvious until you've done a bit of meditation. But I think this is another way in which the Buddhist claim about the suffering nature of things does pass the test of logic and evidence. Evidence meaning you can check it out yourself and see if it's not true. And relative to nirvana, which is the limit of complete experience, so complete that it is right on the cusp of existence and non-existence, relative to nirvana, everything hurts. Subtly, subtly, subtly, but subtly significant. So actually, I think the Buddhist doctrine does pretty good about the suffering nature of things. There's also the flip side, which is the nature of suffering, which I've already sort of mentioned, at least the way I think about it. The nature of suffering is what happens when we have uncomfortable experiences without concentration, clarity, and equanimity. And it's also what happens when we have neutral experiences without those. And it's also what happens when we have pleasant experiences without those. This is one of the first insights that I had in my meditation career. As you all know, I approached Buddhism in the old-fashioned way. It was old school. It was Asia. And they made me sit in the full lotus for a full hour, hour after hour. And it was all about pain. It was all about pain. I thought, this is Looney Tunes. But that's it. Take it or leave it. That's the way we do it. But it was so worth it, because you're sitting there, and it's getting worse and worse and worse. And then at some point, discrimination, vipassana, seeing separate. You actually see that the pain is one thing, and the fighting with the pain is another thing. They are different critters. And before that, you never noticed, because as soon as there was the pain, there was the fighting. So someday, some tricky lawyer is going to do some tort case where they're going to say, well, this person's a Buddhist, so they can only be recompensed for the pain, not the suffering. Because it's always like you get pain and suffering. Oh, I shouldn't put this on the internet. Someone will actually think of this. OK, hey, you're a Buddhist, right? So we're only going to give you half as much, because you just got the pain. You didn't have the suffering. I can be meditative. So you can see it. So all my life, until I started to meditate, it's like, well, as soon as I have pain, I have suffering. They're the same thing. And that's why the lawyers ask for pain and suffering if you've had a tort. But now I can see it's like, OK, the pain is one thing, and my mental judgments about it are quite a different thing, and the way my body tightens around it is yet a completely different thing. And oh, yeah, we can relax that tightening, and we can let go of those judgments. And then it's like, does it hurt? Yes, but it's just not the same. That discrimination, that was worth every moment of what I had to go through. Because otherwise, I never would have known. Who would have thunk it? Pain is one thing. The suffering is something else. The resistance to the pain is a completely different thing. And when the two come together, you have suffering. So that's the nature of suffering. And then when there's just the pain, without this other stuff, there's less suffering. And then I extrapolate it. It's like, OK, if diminishing the resistance somewhat causes the suffering to diminish somewhat, then where will this lead? Well, it is theoretically possible that there could be zero resistance, and therefore no suffering at all. And that would apply both to emotional pain and physical pain. So if I only got that one insight in my entire meditation career, it would still be worth the price and admission. Because otherwise, I would have had to live my life without knowing. Oh my god, how does anyone live their life without knowing that? You've got this sort of Damocles hanging over your head. It can fall down any time. So there's the suffering nature, which I think has maybe not everything that the Buddhist tradition says about that is valid. But I think plenty of it is when you analyze. There's the suffering nature, and then there's the nature of suffering, which is a very, very useful insight. Anicca. I'm sorry, dukkha. OK, anicca, impermanence. What about that? Well, that's pretty evident, that things don't last. And if we pin 100% of our happiness on things that aren't going to last, then we are definitely setting ourselves up for suffering. What else is there to say about that? Well, a couple things, actually. One of the criticisms of Buddhism is that, well, because it encourages people to become indifferent to circumstances, objective circumstances, because it's all impermanent. So why bother? Why care? And it doesn't help that the early Buddhist lifestyle was one of renouncing the society and going off and living a sannyasi life. That means you know, when I became a Buddhist monk in Japan, there's quite a little ceremony that you do. You, well, I haven't thought about this for a long time. What was it? Yeah. Kokuro, fumo, kokuro, uchida. Just remembering in Japanese. So they shave most of your head except for a little piece that they leave, and I get shaved at the ceremony. Okay, so symbolically that's the last thing. And you put on robes for the first time. I haven't thought about this for a long time. This is like 1970. So the robes have really long sleeves, and I, so they put these robes on you, you know, you complete the ceremony, you get the last little piece of hair is cut off, and then you have to go like to this shrine area and chant some mantras and things. And so I like walked out the door, right, and the first thing I did was catch that sleeve on a post and rip it. Okay, this is mindfulness clothes I've got on. These clothes are designed to make you pay very close attention. You know, just like as a Buddhist monk. But what I was remembering was that just before they cut off that last hair thing, there are three kakemono. Kakemono in Japanese are those scrolls that hang, you know, or like long rectangular pieces of paper. And you have to bow to each one three times to say goodbye, goodbye forever. And the first one says Fumo, Fumo, right, father and mother. And the second one says Kokuro, Kokuro. The king of the country or the ruler of the country. And the third one says Uchidami in Japanese. Chinese that would be Jashan, your family gods. And you say goodbye. That represents all of traditional society of ancient times in Asia. You say goodbye to that because now you're in a completely, you are Chuja, you have left Chuke, you have left it all. That's called sannyasa in Sanskrit. So that was the system that was set up in India because India is a very stereotyped society and has had, had and still has very stereotyped roles. So if you wanted to be a transcendent specialist, there's good news. You can. The society will support you, but you have to shave your head and wear the robes of a criminal. You know, the orange jumpsuits, the criminals. It's the same thing in India. You're just out of the pale of society. You're just a whole different thing. So because there is that social model in Buddhism, you can see why people, and then because there's this notion, okay, everything's impermanent, so Buddhism must teach people that, to be indifferent to circumstances and the needs of society. I'm criticizing to, in order to answer the critics, okay. This is the stuff that you see on the internet, anti, the things that people that don't like Buddhism, this is the kind of things that they say about it. It's like, because it teaches everything is, any compounded thing is impermanent, so the implication is, why bother about compounded things? And besides, it's sort of the proof of that is these social structure of early Buddhism, which was just say goodbye to the world. Now just because India at that time had a certain social structure, and that worked for the Buddha, does not mean there is anything intrinsic in the notion of impermanence that says we should be indifferent to circumstances. It just says that we should not pin 100% of our happiness on circumstances, which I think is very reasonable. We should allocate a certain amount of time and energy towards exploring happiness that is not dependent on something that is impermanent. And unfortunately, that form of happiness actually does exist. You often see a confusion between detachment or indifference with regards to the object of world, and detachment or, I wouldn't even say indifference, I would just say, people confuse that with what I call equanimity. And so my concept of equanimity is designed to answer the critics, and also to clarify things for people that work within the Buddhist tradition. The ability to let sensory experience come and go without push and pull, the ability to do that, I think is a very important ability. That does not mean two things. It does, the ability to allow sensory experience to come and go without involvement, to take a hands-off attitude with regards to the expansion and contraction of sensory experience, that ability does not imply two things that some people think it implies. It is a pretty radical thing, because we're not just talking about bodily sensations, we're talking about mental states also. The ability to allow sense and nonsense to come and go with indifference, the ability to allow physical and emotional pleasure and pain to come and go with indifference with regards to how they expand and contract in your senses, that ability is very useful. But notice I said, the ability to do that. Because what people think you're saying is that you're advocating walking around all the time stuck on that and that only. Equanimity is an ability. On demand, when it's appropriate to be able to have this hands-off attitude. At other times, you can absolutely take a stand with regards to your sensory experience. We do it all the time. Every time we do Nurture Positive, we're saying we're selectively attending to positive content. We're not just letting anything come and go. That's a different practice. And actually, the ability to let negatives come and go in the background helps us selectively attend to positive content. And even to be open to that positive content informing our being, which is the Nurture Positive practice. So, the ability to, when it's appropriate or when you want to, to detach from sense and nonsense in the mind, positive and negative thoughts, let them come and go without carrying, or rather without push and pull. The ability to do that, the ability to let pleasure and pain, physical and emotional come and go, the ability to allow things to congeal and melt without preferences, that is equanimity and that's a hugely useful skill to have. But it doesn't mean that that's all you ever do just because you have that skill. You can take a stand. You can reject negative thoughts. In fact, you can do that better if you have that skill. And the other thing that it doesn't imply is that you're indifferent to external circumstances, that you're going to take a hands-off attitude with regards to how your life goes or how the society goes. And I would claim that in fact the ability to not interfere with the way the world makes you feel frees up energy to take a stand, to make the world a better place. So, yes, everything in the world may be ultimately impermanent and therefore to pin your happiness on it is 100% is not a good idea, but you can pin some happiness on it. There's some limited predictabilities in the world. But you want to have another source of happiness, one that's not dependent on impermanent things. And so that's why I formulated the notion of equanimity. And I always say it's a skill that's a relationship to sensory experience and should never be confused with indifference to circumstances. But there's a deep, deep, deep reason why people do make that confusion. Because it is not easy to let, to just allow the world to impact on your mind and body without interfering with that impact. It seems like you're going to just die. And it seems like you're going to become passive and ineffectual. In other words, the sensory experience of equanimity at a deep level initially seems like it's going to make you indifferent and therefore vulnerable and irresponsible. And so you're afraid to have complete equanimity. And it's only after you've sort of gone over that hump and you realize, no, it doesn't work that way. Just because I have the ability to experience the litany of horrors that is the six o'clock news so fully that I don't suffer, that does not mean that I stop caring about what I see on television. In fact, very much the opposite. But some part of us doesn't believe that until we've been over that hump. And so it just holds on. And it's like, no, I can't totally let this have me because then I'm going to be half. So anyway, impermanence. So what is it that we can have that will be a reliable source of happiness if conditioned things are impermanent? Well, we'll talk about that in a moment. No self. There's a very good reason to define enlightenment in terms of realizing no self. As long as you don't get too caught up in words, because half the world calls that experience the true self. And if you're caught up in words, then it's like you just miss the point. You can't see the liberation in people that have theistic religions or people that are working within a Hindu context that are talking about realizing the true witness, the true self. You can't see that the Yoga Sutras are talking about the same thing as the Buddhist sutras. You can't see that because the description seems to be the diametric opposite. If Buddhist enlightenment is no self and someone goes around saying self, self, self, then they must be quite misguided. No, they've just chosen for very legitimate reasons to call that self. So I would just give that one little caveat. We don't want the litmus test to be certain words. We want the litmus test to be certain experiences. It's been my experience that there are perhaps four different flavors of no self. I like to use this inner system of mental image, mental talk, and body emotion for a lot of different reasons. I like to use that to analyze the experience of self as a sensory system. Now, there's other ways to chop up that pot. There's the five aggregates, there's the four foundations. You could broadly say, well, anything mind and body is self, et cetera, et cetera. But for various reasons, parsimony and a bunch of other things. Oh, parsimony, that just means simplicity. I like to use that system. So just for now, we're going to work within that system. I always like to say that the inner see, hear, feel sometimes reacts to the outer sight, sound, touch. Sometimes it goes off proactive, spins memory, plan, fantasy. The individual elements interact with each other. That's why I call it a system. It's a system. And then every once in a while, the interactivity just turns off. Sometimes it turns off because out expands. There's only a finite amount of real estate in consciousness, so out expands and in contracts. And that's those famous sad stories of master enlighten me. And the master says, go down! The master says, see, I enlightened you. The idea being for just a moment before there was the reaction. If you just look back, you see the system just went offline. The inner system was just swamped by the sound. But it's very hard to notice that moment. But if you sit and just sort of watch, either because out expands or just because the system just goes offline, when the interactivity ceases, there's no sense of I. And if you're looking or hearing or touching something external, and that continues unbroken 30 seconds, a minute, two minutes, the inner system does not activate, your identity just goes elastic and you just start inhabiting what was formerly out. So that's one flavor of no self. Another flavor of no self is, well, the system is activated, but the components at all of their fractal scales are completely untangled. Because remember, it's not just one scale of image, talk, body, emotion. Inside an image is all sorts of subtle talk and body emotion. And inside each one of those strands is like subtle images. And so untangling this multi-scale scheme of inner senior field is no small deal. But if you get them completely untangled, an emergent property called self is thing vanishes. And you know I've given several metaphors for that. If you have red and white thread and you just sort of tangle them together and look at it from a distance, it seems to be pink. But then as you get closer and look at what's actually there, the emergent property, the illusory property of pinkness goes away. It's just red and there's white. So there's senior field, inner senior field, mental image, mental talk, body emotion, particularly the self-referential stuff, but in general all of it. And it's all tangled together. With sensory clarity, if at all the scales, not just the surface scale, but at all the scales, if you get those waveforms completely untangled and they are able to interpenetrate without interfering like soliton waves, that gives you an experience of flow self that is... No, no, I'm sorry, that gives you an experience of no self that's based on untangling, on untangling or resolution effect. And this is the classic description of no self in early Buddhism. It's usually applied to the five aggregates. And I've given many talks, you've heard this many times. It's also done with the four great elements in early Buddhism. There's this shocking description the Buddha gives of just as a skillful butcher would carve up a steer, and at some point the perception steer goes away and the perception meat arises. That's actually in the Buddhist scriptures. Clearly they weren't vegetarian 2500 years ago, or at least some were. Okay, so you chop it up and the perception, well, just to extend the metaphor, the perception self goes away and the perception inner seer field clearly arises. And it's not a thing called self. So if we call the turning off of the inner system no self in the sense of N-O, I sometimes jokingly call the no self experience that comes through fully untangling, I call that no self, K-N-O-W, self. You so fully have known the components that it's a no self experience. Then those individual components can show you that they're vibrating super strings. This of course is just a metaphor. Again, I'm not saying that it's quantum physics, okay. But they're sort of like vibrating super strings. They are vibrating space. And sometimes the whole inner system, even if you can't untangle the strands at all the levels, you get this sense that the surface activity in the inner system has sort of gone away, but there's this undercurrent of shimmering on the mental screen. There's this rumbling in talk space, a kind of idling in the emotional circuits. There's this vibratory flow that's filling the subject in space. If you sort of zoom out, cover that whole space, and just sort of give permission for that inner field to shimmer, that will create another flavor of insight into no self. And then there is the even deeper experience of what's behind that shimmering field, which is this effortless simultaneous expansion contraction that I talk about every time I talk, almost. This is, Sasaki Roshi called it, Mujo no Hataraki. The activity of impermanence, Kongen no Hataraki, the activity of the source. Busho no Hataraki, the activity of the Buddha nature. These are just all synonyms. But impermanence is maybe its main name. Because it's like trying to pin, it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall. As soon as you think it's expansion, it's also contraction. As soon as you think it's contraction, it's also expansion. And it embraces. It is a kind of flow of space. And there can be a figure ground reversal. Where you say that, well, because that's what's behind all that foam, and that foam is what senior field is made of, then this is what I am. And that's where the irony comes in that we finally come back and answer our question. Well, if conditioned things are impermanent, so we shouldn't pin all of our happiness on that. We can pin some happiness on it. But we should allocate a certain amount of time and energy to finding a happiness and ordering principle that is permanent. And that's where the little irony can be found. Because it is the activity of impermanence that is our true birthright. And since it does give us an experience of not only the inner senior field, but the outer senior field arising, co-arising. Well, not only does it provide that permanent fulfillment, because even after the mind and body die, to the extent that you've said, I'm not my mind and body, but I am this empty activity that is responsible for my mind and body. To the extent that you've said that many, many times, thousands of times, thousands of times a day, during a lifetime, to that extent, you don't die. You just side-switch. You just do an end run around the passing away of your mind and body. So a case could be made that therein lies a permanent source of happiness. But because it's not just what molds the inner world, the inner senior field, it molds the outer senior field. So it seems like you're always looking at that with which you share a womb. You're looking at... the fraternity and sorority of creation are in your face constantly. And so that source of personal, permanent happiness is also a constant reminder to care about other people, thus totally giving the lie, totally overcoming the misconception that people that do this practice become indifferent to the plight of others..</p>
