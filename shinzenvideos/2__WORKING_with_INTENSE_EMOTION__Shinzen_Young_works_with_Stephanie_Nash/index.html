<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>A couple more questions. Yeah. Is the, which is the source of the greatest distress? Is it the feel or the tension reaction? The feel, absolutely. So, you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension reaction. No, when the feel, yeah. So, the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation. Absolutely. Okay, that helps me hone in a little bit more on what our target should be. Right. Have you attempted, well, I should say, as you know, a basic principle in mindfulness is divide and conquer. Case in point, you have divided this experience into, okay, there's the emotional body sensations, that's one component. Then there's the muscle reactions to those, that's the second component. So, that's already a divide and conquer, and that has already given you some relief that the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances. As you remember, a second axiom is if divide and conquer doesn't work, remember what I always say, subdivide until you do conquer. In this case, have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors, anger, fear, sadness? In other words, have you applied the noting, feeling, flavor technique to this intense arising? Yes, I have. What I have found to be more helpful is the investigating where exactly I'm feeling what. Is there clenching here, what are the boundaries, is there more pressure in, is it pushing out? The more I'm investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality, that's been a little more successful in helping me go through it. But I can tell you the quality. The subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the quality, which is the noting, feel, flavor, so that gives you the spectrum, anger, fear, sadness, interest, what have you. But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. So, then that would be like... Do you want to stop for one second? No, let's just let go. It could happen during a real session. So, you can subdivide into flavors, but you can also subdivide into locations. So, it's an application of the same principle. So, you're saying that subdividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive. Yeah, location and quality of sensation. You mean, so it's a little of both? Yes. Flavor and location, you're getting specific about those. Yeah. So, you've already made the major thing that I would first try, okay, because you've internalized the algorithm so well. And you say that that does help. Do you note the location, like with the location word, face? No, I haven't been doing that out loud. But you've been tracking the location, and then it sounds like you're staying up for a little while in a location. And moving my awareness around inside of it. Sort of inventory and see what it's like. When I'm inside of it, it's so much easier than when I'm outside of it, for me. Well, that, once again, sounds like a pretty optimal strategy.

Fear and sadness. Yeah. Is there any reason for it, or is it just erupting in the body? I have, like I said, I think there was an event or two that triggered it on the outside, but this was out of proportion to that.

I think it drew everything up that resonated at that frequency, and it's just kind of really thrown me at how huge it is. And they say in Ohio, huge, you're supposed to say huge.
