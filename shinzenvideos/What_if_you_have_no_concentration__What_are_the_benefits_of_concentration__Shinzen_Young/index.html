<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>What if you don't have any concentration? I know it helps build it, but what if you don't even have enough to stay, keep your focus there for five seconds? Well, everybody has to start somewhere. If you think of the analogy to a workout, if you've never worked out, the very first time you work out, you get winded in like two minutes, right? And it's like, oh my God, at this rate, I'll never get anywhere. What you don't realize is that the growth is not linear. It's somewhat hockey stick, so that you grow faster as you grow more. So it's true initially that you might very well have the experience that you're describing, which is just like, I'll never get this because I, you know, it's like I'm here 1% of the time and 99% of the time I'm like lost in ruminations and worrying about, you know, body sensations, sounds, memory, plan, fantasy. That's my memory, plan, fantasy, reaction, judgment. When I decided I was going to like, okay, I'm going to be healthy, I'm going to run. So I was 21 years old, but I'd never really worked out or done anything. I ran down the block and at the end of the block, I'm like, and it's like, oh my God, I mean, I'll never be able to run more than a block. But within two months, I was running miles, right? It was a dramatic change. So initially, yes, you may have to put up with that. But everyone has to start somewhere. Another way to look at it is if you never start, then you'll have to live your entire life in a scattered state, an unrecollected state, as the Christians would say. You know, I quoted T.S. Eliot before. He's got this great phrase where he says, this is a place of disaffection, meaning ordinary experience, right? This is a place of disaffection. Then he goes on and eventually says, distracted from distraction by distraction. People are so distracted, they don't even realize they're distracted. So distracted from distraction by distraction. That's how you're going to have to live your whole life and it's going to be time to die really quick. And then you will not have lived and you'll freak out. So you've got to start somewhere. So the bad news is, yes, you might have to put up with what you're describing for a while, like getting a stitch when you first try to work out, but things get better with practice. If you don't do something like that, you'll basically just live your life just in that distracted state, meaning you won't really live your life. Meaning you're not focusing on what's relevant back to your concentration model? Exactly. You can either say, oh my God, this is awful. I'm able to focus 10% of the time and 90% of the time I'm away. So you can make that a problem or you can make that an insight. You can realize, oh, this is how most people live. This is how I would have lived otherwise. So you're never really being present. You're spending the present thinking about the past and the future. Essentially, that's the human condition at least at this point in history. What that means is that people don't fully live each moment and therefore they don't really live. If you discover when you first attempt to meditate that it's nine to one, one unit of focus versus nine unit of distraction, that means that you're missing 90% of your life. That's the bad news. When it comes time to die, you won't have lived and you'll freak out. On the other hand, the good news is with practice, you can get it reversed. Does it take two months like it did for you to run two miles? No, it takes longer typically. Six months to a year of regular practice. What's regular? I would say 10 minutes each day and at least four hours of intensive continuous practice per month. That's why I have the home practice program so people can call by phone wherever they are in the world. Oh, I was going to ask you about that later. Maybe we should finish up this one thought. The bad news is that you may have what might be called a sobering realization when you first try to meditate, which is it's like I say, it's 90% of the time I'm unable to focus. Well, with enough practice, you can eventually reverse that. You're 90% focused. You've basically multiplied your ability to be present by a factor of nine. That means you get to live life nine times as big as the average human being. When it comes time to die, you will have participated enough in life that you won't freak out. You will have completed your life activity. If I were to tell a person, hey, give me 10 minutes each day, subtract 10 minutes each day from your life and every month subtract four hours and keep that up for the duration and you'll be able to live to be 300 years old. Well, that would be something like amazing, right? Yeah. That's not possible. You can't add 100 and 200 and however many years to a person's life. However, what you can do is multiply your ability to be present in each moment and you can do that dramatically. As the result of that, you'll get to live life two, three, four times as big as you would otherwise. The effect will be the same richness as though you live to be 100, 200 or 300. That's actually doable by anyone. Formal meditation practice subtracts a little bit of time from your life, but it multiplies the richness and depth of the rest of the time. As we say, do the math. It's a good deal.</p>
