<p>Purification We talk a lot about purification on this path and especially I hear you talk about it as one of the benefits or events that happen with this practice. And I'll speak to my own experience, but purification isn't always pretty. <br><br> And sometimes you can be blindsided with lots of emotion or disconcerting internal talk. Could you just speak to this process of working with purification and or how it can arise? What are the different forms of purification that we could experience in terms of working with that as its own phenomenon? Sometimes people confuse the purification and might think that's a new problem. When one practices, as time goes on, one develops a kind of sensitivity to something that I call purification. In fact, I would say that one of the major watersheds in a person's practice is when they start to develop the taste of purification where they can actually sense that purification has happened. <br><br> So what do we mean by purification? It's a perception that because of the way that I'm experiencing this moment with high concentration, sensory clarity, and especially equanimity, because of the way I'm experiencing this moment, things that have been getting in the way from the past are getting worked through. And you actually sense that that is happening. Now, how do you sense that? That's hard to put into words. <br><br> You just develop a... it's like wine tasting. Tasters can detect all sorts of subtleties in flavor, bouquet, finish, tannins, what have you. <br><br> They just develop the palate to detect stuff that the average person doesn't detect. At some point, every meditator who stays with the process develops this sense that because of how I'm experiencing the present, the past is being worked through. Like I say, I can't put into words how you know it's happening, but you just do. You also know that because of that, every moment in the future is going to be better for you. So that's a huge watershed in practice, because before that happens, your preoccupation with regards to meditation is to have certain experiences while you meditate. You want to be concentrated, you want to be calm, you want to have altered states, you want to have whatever you want to have. Feel good, have something interesting and entertaining or unusual happen. When people start their practice, that's how they evaluate their practice. It's like, oh, something good or interesting or unusual happened, so that was a good meditation. At some point, if you stay with it, you develop this sensitivity for the purification. And then your motivations shift. <br><br> You're not interested in getting to any particular state. You're interested in setting the stage for nature to optimize purification. You set the stage and let time pass, and the purification is taking place, and you can taste it. And because you can taste it, you don't mind if you're in a lot of pain in your body, you don't mind if there's a lot of emotions in your body, you don't mind if there's a lot of confusion in your mind. <br><br> Because, although by all ordinary ways of thinking, pain in the body, uncomfortable emotions in the body, confusion in the mind, that's like the last thing in the world anybody would ever want. But if you can taste the purification while that's going on, so you know the past is getting worked through, and the future, every moment of the future will be better for me because of how I'm experiencing this present moment, uncomfortable though it is. Once that taste of purification kicks in, then you start to grow exponentially. <br><br> The rate of growth takes off in a hockey stick mode. When you're saying taste of purification, it's making it sound like, ah, I'm developing a taste. You know, when someone's drinking wine, they know they're drinking wine. But to know the interpretation of if that is purification, if it isn't purification, and or, my relationship to that is that you said, oh, I don't mind if I'm in pain, I don't mind. <br><br> When you say develop a taste, do you mean where that starts to become a pleasant experience?
