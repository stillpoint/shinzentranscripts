<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>If you do a healthy merging with someone, it's not just good for you, it's good for them and they won't feel invaded in any way. And that's a skill of being able to do the merging and not make it look like you're invading them somehow. You actually have to practice that. So when you healthy merge with someone, they shouldn't feel like they're being somehow invaded. They should feel like they're being loved unconditionally and everyone wants that. Which goes to the equanimity piece. The healthy merging is a state of unconditional positive regard towards that person. So this is a question that comes up because people get to a certain depth with their practice and they start to experience this merging. I had this come up just a few days ago with someone. And then they're noticing that people are sort of pulling away from them or something because their focus is too intent. And the Chinese have this expression, how can I translate it? Tone down the light and share the dust. It means like don't... Share? Share the dust. It means don't blow ordinary humans away by looking like you belong to the non-human realm too much. It's a skill. I know people tell me that you're supposed to share your innermost experience and students love that. I don't know if I'd buy that, okay? Because do you really want that much information about your teachers? There is such a thing as TMI. So here I'm going to take a chance. Now I got your attention. Okay this is true, okay? Not a day goes by that sometime bopping around in the world just interacting with people I will have this impish thought. I'm passing for one of them. They don't know. They think I'm a regular North American human. And of course most of me is. But there's a part that's not human. And it's like they don't know. They're deceived by the surface. And it's sort of fun. Like someone, I don't know, getting away with passing for something that they're not back in the days when there was racism. It's like pulling the wool over their eyes. Anyway maybe that made no sense at all. But you have to pass as a human after you've learned to contact a little bit of what is not human. So you have to express that in a way that doesn't weird people out. And it takes some training. So what characterizes, the reason I laughed when you said why do we merge, okay, is the real question is not why do we merge. The real question is why don't we all merge. What happened that got in the way of what was originally there at birth. That's all there was. We just were. We were everything. And then I can remember when the self arose within me as a separate. I don't have very good memory of childhood, of specific events. But boy I absolutely remember when my personhood arose. And it was at an early age. And it's like, why, something's changed. Something's changed. I used to just be happy all the time for no reason. And now I'm worrying. And it was the arising of talk space. Before that it's like there weren't any issues. It's like why am I not happy anymore? Why am I constantly thinking about the past and the future? I was like, I didn't know what was happening to me and I couldn't stop it. So the question is not why do we merge. It's like what happened that prevented us. Well what happened was we accumulated enough life experience that we developed a thinking mind.
