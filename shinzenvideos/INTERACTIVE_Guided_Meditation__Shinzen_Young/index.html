<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>So as far as I know, you have developed a form of teaching that I've never known of before, interactive guided meditation, where instead of telling someone what to do to meditate or describing it to a group while they meditate, you one-on-one interactively work with someone and talk to them while they're meditating, with them talking back to you. Can you tell me how you came up with this? First let me say, of course, that's not the only way that I teach. I do those other things too, groups and so forth. But what I really love is the one-on-one work, which can be done face-to-face in person, but also works very well over the telephone, which is enormously convenient because people that study with me, I give them my telephone number and they can call me when they're in crisis or when they just need to tune up and so forth. So we can work over the phone also that way. So I can do it face-to-face or I can do it over the telephone with someone. How it developed was that I had my own center in Los Angeles many years ago and we had residents and they would sit, we would sit as a group early in the morning and then they would go off and do their jobs and then we'd come back and we'd sit together in the evenings. So what I would do is during the morning sits is I would give them interviews and that's very standard. You go into a teacher and you sort of talk about your practice. But typically the interviews that are done last for 10 minutes, something like that. You get a chance to ask some questions, we sort of touch base and so forth. So when I started I was doing those kinds of standard interviews and I don't know quite how it occurred to me but it just sort of gradually dawned on me, well wait a minute, you know, what's the metaphor for a meditation teacher? Well there's a lot of possible metaphors. The Buddha described himself as a physician. You know there's a disease called suffering and I have an intervention that is a sufficient cure for that. So I thought, well what's the metaphor for me? I'm a coach. So what does a coach do? Well if you go to the YMCA you ask a staff member to show you how to use the equipment and then they stand by you and they make sure you're using the equipment properly and they have good form and they give you some encouragements and they answer your questions and they sort of check in with you. So I thought, well gee, that's a natural way to go about this. So I started to say, okay, do this and then I would just sit with them and do my own meditation and then so ten minutes later, okay, when you did that, what happened? And they would say, well this happened or that happened. And then I would say, okay, it means this or I think you should modify it just a little bit, it might help and so forth. And we'd like sit for a few more minutes and we'd do that. And I started to notice it was really working. Because when you first learn how to meditate, if you're working in the mindfulness tradition, you're really wearing two hats. On one hand, you're the meditator. On the other hand, you're trying to observe yourself and that's very tricky. It's very hard to do that until you internalize the skill. So if somebody interactively guides you, you can let go of the hat of being the meditator. You just follow their guidance and you can stay with your experience. So as time went on, I started to develop a more and more elaborate decision tree until it became this incredibly powerful algorithm that just loops and branches until the person has a breakthrough experience and works with a high degree of reliability. So it's a combination of you not having to wear the two hats plus the sort of presence of an experienced teacher as a sort of contact high kind of impact. Plus the sharing of a lot of expert knowledge because I know the windows of opportunity that nature presents literally minute to minute. Nature is constantly presenting people with windows to transcendence. People don't know how to recognize it. When I'm working interactively with somebody, I spot when a window is open and I point them in that direction. It just works like a charm. And that's where it's really like a designer meditation because when someone does a guided meditation, you're still handing over the wheel. Someone else is still driving on that. But what this does is it know two guidances. I think I've been guided privately in meditation over the years with you. I don't know how many times, dozens and dozens, and it's never been the same way twice. So I think of it kind of as a designer meditation in that moment using those opportunities.
