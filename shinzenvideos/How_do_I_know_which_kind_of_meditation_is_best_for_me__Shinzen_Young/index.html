<p>Meditation is a way to get to know yourself. Meditation is a way to get to know yourself. Now there's different kinds of meditation. Somebody says, hi, I'm looking at a candle. Somebody else is saying, what's the sound of one hand clapping or whatever. What's the difference really in them and what distinguishes them or what's an advantage? How do I know which one I want to do? It's a matter of trial and error, I would say. Read about the different traditions and you see which way of working appeals to you intellectually. You also check out different teachers, see their teaching style, their personality, their emphasis. They're all different. Some are very heartfelt. Some are very intellectually clear and precise. Like you? Yeah, I'm more the, as T.S. Eliot would have said, the sharp compassion of the healer's art. Maybe a little bit less on the heartfelt side. Everybody has their specialty. So you check out the intellectual model. You check out the personality of the teacher or teachers. You can have more than one teacher. Is that confusing to have more than one teacher? It depends. For some people that is confusing, but some people are naturally bi-spiritual or poly-spiritual. You can be bi or poly. For those people it's not confusing. The main difference in the different meditation traditions is what do they have you focus on? How do they have you build the concentration? Typically, concentration power is built by giving somebody an object to focus on. Then when their attention wanders, they bring it back. Then it wanders again, and they bring it back over and over again. I say typically because there are exceptions where you don't actually have an object that you focus on. But that's pretty specialized. Most forms of meditation will give you an object. By an object, could you tell me what you mean? A sensory experience of some sort. I'll give you a range of possibilities. Typical sensory experiences a person might focus on are the physical sensations of breathing, which would be a body sensation that is specific and physical. The physical sensation of breathing is one common object. External sound is another common object. You can do it with music, for example. Some people do a music-based meditation. You focus on music as a meditation. Yes, on the sound of the music. Another sensory experience could be, as you mentioned, something that's external sight, like a flower or a candle. Your attention wanders, you bring it back. The object could be an internal sound of a mantra, which is any syllable, word, phrase, sentence that you repeat over and over again. That could be an object. It could be an internal image. For example, some people like to visualize a sphere of light or something like that that they would look at, or a blank extent of brightness or darkness. That would be an image-type thing. Does it matter which one of these you do? Is there an advantage to looking at a sphere of light versus listening to music? Let me list a few more, and then we'll talk about the relative advantages and disadvantages. Let's see. We could have touch. We could have sight, sound. We could have mental image. We could have an internal talk, but in the form of a syllable or word or sentence that is repeated over and over again, which would tend to cool out talk space, your internal chattering. That's called mantra in Sanskrit, but the Christians used it too. Most of the traditions used it. That's image talk. You could even focus on an emotional sensation, like a pleasant emotional feeling in your body, like love or something like that. Certain kinds of physical touches, sight, external sights, external sounds, mental images, certain kinds of internal talk, certain kinds of emotional feel in the body, would be typical objects that a person might take as a concentration. Just like everything. Potentially anything, because you're training a generic skill. It does have to be based on sensory experience. You pick a sensory experience, your attention will wander, it will be pulled elsewhere, you bring it back, you wander, bring it back. Each time you bring it back, it's like lifting a weight, you're strengthening your muscles, you may get tired, but in the end your muscles get strong if you do that consistently.

As to the advantages and disadvantages, I would say it very much depends on what appeals to you and what works for you as a person. So try out different things. So would someone move from one to another, like say today I want to listen to music and tune into that experience, and if my mind wanders I come back to the music, and maybe tomorrow I want to watch this light in front of my eyes.
