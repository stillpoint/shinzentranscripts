<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>So you're off and running, in four hours you've got the beginnings of a mindfulness practice. And then the core curriculum is set up so that there are sort of level one programs in the five ways and there's a part two that's sort of like a more detailed, deeper version. And you take that the next month. So after you take part one, one month, and part two the next month, now you know that entire way. So that in theory, in say ten months, if you were to participate every month, you would have learned all five of them. But you may not want to learn all five, you may want to just learn one of them and stay with that. So we have the intro, we have core curriculum that teaches the part one and part two of each of the five ways. And then we have, for people once they learn those techniques, they have deepening retreats, sharpening retreats, and special application retreats. The sharpening retreats, I guide them interactively with special exercises that sharpen their ability and then the theme retreats, they apply the techniques to certain themes like dealing with pain or dealing with emotions or dealing with behavior change or decision making, any practical, many practical applications that they can have. Wow, that's interesting. So, yeah. So, it's a very carefully organized curriculum and basically I would say to summarize it, and it doesn't cost appreciable money, in fact if you don't have money it doesn't cost anything. And we tell you how to get really cheap long distance calling. So what happens is people call in, they're socializing, then there's an hour and a half guidance around the theme, which may involve Q&amp;A. Then people hang up. So people can, you're guiding but people can actually ask you questions. They can interact with me in the group setting and then after an hour and a half everyone hangs up and they practice on their own for an hour. During that period of time they can stretch and get coffee. Oh, so you're not sitting there for four hours straight. But also during that period of time they can call me personally. 90 people? No, typically what happens is there's about 60 people and about one out of ten has a need during that program to talk to me and they have my private number. We give out, when you register, my private telephone number that goes with the TERF. So it's usually about 10% of the people need to talk to me and I can usually handle the most of those in that hour period. So you actually get a chance to talk, if you really need it, one-on-one with me. If I back up then I make an appointment with you to talk to you later that day or very soon afterwards. So it serves as the potential for touching base personally with a teacher any month you need that. And then after that hour? After that hour they come back and we have a group Q&amp;A for a half an hour and then they... Everybody hears, everybody asks questions. Everybody hears the other's questions. And then there's another hour of guidance and then there's a little more socializing. And four hours have passed and you've had four hours of a retreat-like environment. All the features that you'd get at a residential retreat, a talk, guidance, chance to work on your own, chance to talk to a teacher, chance to hear other people's questions and experience. It's all packed into four tightly organized hours. Don't have to leave your home, don't have to leave your family, don't have to mess with your work schedule. Anybody can get four hours on some weekend. Now I've got a question, if I've never meditated before and I'm going to be doing one of these four hour retreats, do I have to get those cushions people have or how do I know how to sit? If you go to basicmindfulness.org there's a document which is about the posture. Oh, okay. So I don't have to like burn incense or... No, there's no particular environment needed. I mean it's nice if it's quiet but it's not required. You mean if kids are running in and out? That doesn't matter because that's the whole point in mindfulness, you deal with what is. So you don't have to burn incense. It's nice if you can get off and it's a quiet environment but if you can't, that's just part of what we work with.</p>
