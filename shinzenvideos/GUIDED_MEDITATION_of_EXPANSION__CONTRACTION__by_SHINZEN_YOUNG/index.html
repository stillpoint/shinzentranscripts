<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Once again, take a moment to stretch up and settle in. The spine is erect through balance and alignment, less through strength and effort. Like a tree expanding to meet father sky, while the whole rest of the body hangs limp and loose, yielding to the contractive force of mother earth. This posture is born in between expansion and contraction. Therefore, the first consciousness, the shoushin, sometimes translated as beginner's mind, the first thing you experience when you sit, exemplifies the ultimate goal of the practice, to give yourself back to the fundamental forces of expansion and contraction. We've been exploring what I call surface expansion contraction, meaning manifestations of the source that are available to anyone. Of course, they may not seem like the source. They may seem quite ordinary, sometimes uncomfortable, even problematic. A good doctor can cure your disease. Probably an extraordinary doctor can convince you you were never sick. Let's review what we've explored so far. We'll begin with the principle of increase or decrease. Something can get more intense. Something can speed up. Something can get larger in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. Nothing special about that. It's expansion though. Affirmation, the principle of increase. Something can decrease in the same ways. Get less intense, where the frequency of an arising can slow down, or something can shrink in one, two, or three dimensions of space. Let's take a moment to explore expansion and contraction in this guise. You may only be aware of increase or decrease. You may be aware of both at the same time. Or there might not be any such movement present, in which case it's actually a form of rest, freedom from those two kinds of change. The expansion and contraction in the sense of increase, decrease may be in just one part of your being, or in one modality, or one location. Or it may be evident broadly throughout your experience, perhaps even a sense that there's always both everywhere. Sometimes the expansion-contraction can be cyclic. Something expands, then it contracts. Or something simultaneously both expands and contracts. And then they disappear. Sometimes the sense of expansion and contraction can be abiding. There's an eternal in and out, in part or all of your being. It's all good, it's all natural. A certain amount of guessing and groping will be involved if you haven't done a lot of this. Recall that one of the dimensions of mindfulness is clarity, and one of the sub-dimensions of clarity is the ability to detect. And this is a detection skill, a noticing of a commonality that may be subtle. If you wish to label, the labels would be expansion, contraction, both, and rest or none for an absence. Okay, good. Now let go of that. And we're going to explore another manifestation, which is pressure force. Often it's in the body, but it could be in visual and auditory, both inner or outer. You may have a sense that something's pushing in, pulling in rather, or pushing out, or doing both at the same time. Or there may be no pressure whatsoever anywhere in your being. Instead of interpreting pressure as problematic, we're going to just think of it as a force that's moving out or moving in, or moving in both directions at once. If it moves in both directions at once, it might interdigitate, sort of pass through itself. Or there might be a clash, an interference. There's no one to blame. If the pressure waves just pass through each other, interpenetrating without interfering, like two ghosts walking along a road, move through each other, well, then fine. But if there's a bang, like two cars hitting each other, just have equanimity with that to the best of your ability. If there's no pressure, enjoy the freedom from pressure. It's a rest or a non-situation. Typically, we have a sense that we need to do something about pressure, ameliorate it in some way. And actually, there can be times when that's useful, appropriate. But for now, we're just going to observe it. I'm going to get my light. Okay, good. Now let go of that and we're going to explore yet another manifestation of expansion-contraction, one which is often interpreted as problematic, and indeed is from a certain perspective, but from another perspective can be looked upon impersonally and blamelessly as just part of the dance of space. You may be aware of your attention scattering or being flooded, you're pulled to more than one thing at the same time, pulled in and out at the same time, or pulled to many places in your body, or pulled to your mind and your body, or your mind goes to many places. Scattering, we'll consider that to be a form of expansion. Or you may be gripped and held by something. It won't let you go. Often we interpret it as I won't let it go. And that can be a valid interpretation, but we're going to think of it differently now. Your space is being limited, held. There's nothing personal about it. There's no blame. Scattering is a part of the dance of space. Gripping is part of the dance of space. So if there's no scattering or gripping, great, enjoy that as a rest state, a freedom from this aspect of expansion, contraction. But if there is, yield to it. Let yourself be spread to the six directions or let yourself be nailed down without fighting. Just taking it to be the flow of space seems like it's scattering and gripping forces, but actually it's just the curvature of space. It's actually an interesting metaphor from general relativity. Whole different way to think about things. Okay, good. Now we're going to explore one more ordinary manifestation of expansion-contraction. But I'll give you a little heads up. There's some subtlety involved in this one. We like to get comfortable by resting in some center. Maybe we're enjoying thinking about a certain something or we're comfortable in a certain sensory environment. We settle in or, quote, get centered. It's comfortable, it's ordering to be centered somewhere, moment by moment. If we get ripped away from whatever our center might be, or if we get knocked off center, that's interpreted as disorder. And it's often uncomfortable. Then we may scramble to get back to center. There's nothing wrong with being centered. But there's something good about becoming free from the need to be centered, to have a fixed position, even for a fraction of a second. This next exercise will probably involve a considerable amount of guessing and groping, and that's perfectly okay. Notice that as soon as you might find a center, something is going to knock you off that center, pull you to the right or to the left or in front or behind or above or below or in all directions at once. The pull might be visual, auditory, somatic, all of them. It could be inner, it could be outer, but as soon as there's a centering, there's a de-centering. Who's responsible for the de-centering? Who gives you that gift that sets you free? It's expansion. Something expands somewhere. And it could be very, very slight, incredibly subtle, but there's a force to pull you off wherever the comfortable alighting center may be, to de-center. Put alternatively, it knocks the center away or causes a gone or a partial gone of wherever the comfortable center might be. When you're aware that your center is being tugged or the rug is being pulled, that's expansion doing that. And the actual collapse of the center, the slipping of the rug under your feet, is a form of contraction. The center will not hold. It dissipates. We'll consider that to be a form of contraction. It's very subtle, it's counterintuitive. In one way, having a center itself is contraction. In another way, the gone of the center is contraction. Expansion prevents you from getting fixated, leaving you with the prospect of learning about a new ordering principle, becoming that authentic human that has no fixed position. The disappearance of the center, however, is contraction. The force that causes it is expansion. Those forces are a primordial ordering principle that can never be disordered, and to the extent that you have one foot firmly placed in each, you can travel effortlessly back and forth between heaven and hell with impunity. If you're aware of your center being even slightly messed with, interpret that as contraction and let it happen. Don't hold on. Move on. But also notice that's happening because of expansion. You're simultaneously expanding and contracting. And it's liberating. I fully appreciate that the words I just spoke may seem utterly inscrutable. That's okay. Just explore. In five minutes, five years, 15 years, 15 minutes before your death, they may be very significant. So far, all of the aspects that we've been looking at are ordinary. Something gets more intense or speeds up or larger. There's an outward pressure force or a scattering force or a force that pulls you out of a comfortable position in consciousness. Or something decreases or slows down or gets smaller or there's an inward pressure force or a gripping force or a disappearance of the ability to hold a center. De-centered, knocked off center. Related with all of the above may be an awareness of deep expansion contraction or not. Deep expansion and contraction is a sense of space effortlessly spreading, effortlessly collapsing or doing both at the same time. Or being perfectly still. No movement from or towards. Deep expansion and contraction lies around, behind, within. All of the ordinary things we've been looking at. Sort of hidden. The reason for looking at surface expansion and contraction is it directs your attention to possibly detecting the effortless dance of space that is the primordial great perfection that proceeds and follows each sensory and motor event. And actually if you understand deeply you'll realize it pervades each sensory and motor event. From the good back to the good without ever leaving the good is to live at the source. To live near fauna. Now let's explore the possibility, certainly not the certainty, but the possibility that something like that might be available to attention at this time. All that will be associated with the ordinary stuff. Something gets more intense there tends to be a spreading. Something speeds up there tends to be a spreading. Something gets larger obviously there's a spreading. But sometimes the pressure could cause a spreading. The scattering is definitely a spreading. And likewise for the converse. So sort of letting go of the sensory content and becoming fascinated with the spirit contour. Let's just explore the possibility that you might be able to detect at this time the deep version. And if that's not available that's perfectly okay. Just choose one or a combination of surface expansion contraction to attend to. Absolutely wow. Sometimes deep expansion and contraction is cyclic. There's a both and then a God of both of them. Both rest, both rest cyclically. Typically small pieces of experience are born in those small cycles. An itch here, an image there. But sometimes the awareness of expansion and contraction is eternal. It's always both. Peppered by an absolute tranquility. It's always none. The reason it's always both and always gone everywhere is because of all those little cycles they sum up. To an eternal efflux and reflux. A formless fountain of youth. A formless spirit womb whose peristalsis births self and world moment by moment. It may just be an idea for you at this time. That's fine. But let's explore the possibility of an experience. Be filled. Now in a moment, we'll transition from formal practice to a bit of discussion. Decide how you'd like to practice intentionally, if at all, during the discussion period. You could maintain formal practice. You could have something sort of going in the background. You could pepper it with micro hits or just suspend the involvement and enjoy the conversation. But make it a clear decision. It's all good. Recall that the goal is to maintain formal practice at all times other than the possibility of during talks and discussions and such. Thank you.</p>
