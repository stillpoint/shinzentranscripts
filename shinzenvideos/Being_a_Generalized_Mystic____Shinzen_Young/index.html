<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>How did you get into Buddhism? Okay, so, let's see here. How I went from being a monk to a non-Buddhist, and how I worked through my various issues on the cushion. Who gave me this question? Don't be embarrassed. At which issues were you thinking of? That could be several Dharma talks. I think you were a pig. A pig one. Well, now that's interesting. We have these teachers' meetings, where the Western Buddhist teachers, meaning the people teaching Buddhism in the West, nothing to do with your ethnic origin, the so-called Western Buddhist teachers, we have these periodic meetings. Next one is going to be in two years, in 2015. And in the past it's been 200, 250, it's probably going to be twice as big next time. It's awesome. These are all full-time teachers. So, we had this meeting, as we do from time to time, and they took us through an interesting process called crossing the line. Anybody here know what this is? I see only like two or three people. That's interesting. I had never seen it. I don't know what is its origin. I mean, I don't know. What would you even call it? It's an empathy builder? So, what they do is, you've got this huge group of people, and they put a line in the middle of the room. And then everybody is on one side of the room. And then they call out different ways that people could be characterized. In fact, the whole range of things. Now, this is, I should say, done with this huge confidentiality agreement thing. Everybody knows that nothing is going to be revealed. It's like, never to leave this room. And then people are safe to reveal who they really are within that group, assuming they feel they're safe enough to do that. And people start doing that. And so it's everything. It's how you think of yourself ethnically. It's how you think about yourself sexually. It's... you name it. Have you ever been arrested? I was one of the few that crossed the line. There weren't many of the Buddhist teachers that had actually been arrested. I thought that was sort of cool. Let's see. Well, you know, are you of Jewish origin? Well, I'm sarcastic. And me, Jack, and Joseph all ended up, of course, we just crossed at the same place, so we all said, ah, I'll just conquer Jewish teachers at this point. So anyway. But it was also things like, who believes in reincarnation? Well, not everyone crossed the line. Who considers themselves a Buddhist? Well, the great majority crossed the line. But I didn't. And I looked around and I saw a couple of other people. You can probably guess who they were, okay? I'm not like, no way am I going to reveal their names. But if you know anything about who writes books about what, you won't have too much difficulty figuring out who was left back there with me. Because I couldn't really say that I'm religiously a Buddhist or identify myself that way. Then how would I identify myself? Well, actually, we went through it yesterday. I'm a generalized mystic. With a scientific mentality. However, absolutely, and hands down, the biggest influence on me is from the Buddhist tradition. There's no doubt about that. Why? Because I look upon the historical Buddha as the first and greatest mystic to attempt to have something like a scientific mentality. To sort of say that, hey, mysticism doesn't have to be covered in mist. That it can be logic and evidence-based. I mean, he obviously wouldn't use those words. I don't make puns in English, okay?
