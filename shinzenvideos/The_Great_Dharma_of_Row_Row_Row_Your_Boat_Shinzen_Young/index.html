<p>This was fantastic. <br><br> I love this. What's your take on this kitty-ditty? Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. I learned it in my earliest school years, but I can't get it out of my mind. Do you suppose that my elementary teachers might have been latent Buddhists? So what that is, is that's the wisdom function within you. Seeing in popular literature the deeper dharma meaning. <br><br> That's really good. They once did, I suppose it's actually been done a lot of times, but I know of one study that was done by a colleague of mine at Harvard Medical School many years ago, where they gave Rorschach tests to a bunch of mindfulness meditators. You know about this study, Dan Brown. Not the Dan Brown that wrote the Da Vinci Code. The Buddhist Dan. <br><br> It's a different person. So what they did is, it's like, okay, let's do psychometrics on monks. You know, Southeast Asian, I guess it was Southeast Asian monks. <br><br> I don't remember the cohort specifically. And they were graded by years of experience. And there were a couple of them that were reputedly enlightened. Okay, that were real senior adepts. <br><br> And what they found was that the senior adepts did something with the Rorschach that had never been recorded in the entire history of Rorschach. And lots of people have taken these. It's the inkblot test, right? You know what it is. You've probably taken it. <br><br> Certainly seen it on TV. So what they found among the reputed arhats was that what had never been recorded previously is, not only did every inkblot appear to contain some Dharma principle, but the sequence of inkblots, no matter how they presented the sequence, became a coherent sequence of Dharma talks. So they concluded that something really major had changed the way that these people see the world. Okay, it's like everything is the Dharma. You know, a Marvel comic book is the Dharma. <br><br> So row, row, row your boat, it's absolutely the secret of enlightenment. It's right in there. It's obvious. You're right. They were crypto Buddhists, every single one of them. Or maybe we're just seeing it in a certain way. <br><br> You can take your choice. So what is this song about? What does my Dharma eye see in this song? Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. So what's the stream? Well, that's sort of interesting. The Buddha said that what we're doing is patisottagamini-madga, that we are on the path that is against the stream. That's where the name of the group comes from, against the stream. <br><br> Okay? But patisotta, pati is against, sotta is the stream. So what does it mean? It means what we do is against the stream of human culture. Human culture tends to encourage people to put all of their time and energy into surface or conditional happiness and never talks about the skill set associated with total happiness, which would include, of course, the deeper or unconditional happiness. So even 2,500 years ago, even in the society of India 2,500 years ago, as far as the Buddha was concerned, the society was pushing people in the other direction. So in that sense, we're going against the stream of human culture because the human culture, you know, if you learn how to control, if you learn the skill of controlling some strings on a musical instrument called a guitar, or you learn the skill of controlling an elastic inflated sphere called a basketball, millions and millions of dollars and adulation and celebrity and, you know, celebrity sex, it all becomes available to you as the result of cultivating those skills. <br><br> So I'll take it in a second. So how—but, you know, is there—are there—there's sports awards, there's academy awards, but, you know, did you see anybody get the award for the greatest manifestation of equanimity this year? Or the longest strong determination set? That's a subcategory, the longest strong determination set by a non-Asian. You didn't see those awards, so in a sense we're against the stream, yes. Did you say that culture teaches us to go downstream? No, well, I'm actually making a contrast, okay? I'm saying that— Okay, you're saying that culture teaches us to go—struggle to go downstream. Well, we can make different metaphors. Okay. <br><br> I'm going to make one just for the fun of it. So the Buddha said we go against the stream, but this song says go with the stream, right? Merrily, merrily, merrily row your boat, gently down the stream. So what's—if we want to make this a Dharma song, then we have to find another stream. The stream of human culture, according to the Buddha, we have to go against that stream. <br><br> But is there a stream that we go with, that we go down, when we're on this path? And I would say that is the stream of nature. That—enlightenment is just waiting to happen. It's implied, actually, in the Buddha's formulation. The Buddha said the Eightfold Path is an intervention that removes a necessary condition for non-perfection, implying that the perfection is just waiting to happen. <br><br> All you got to do is knock out what's getting in the way. So when I said that, it is possible that the spontaneity aspect that the masters speak about may be that they're tasting entropy. Well, entropy is the force behind all spontaneous— well, maybe not all, but— I'm not a physical chemist, but it's the force behind spontaneous reactions. <br><br> When things just happen, they happen because of entropy. For example, do you ever wonder why it is if you stretch a rubber band, all you have to do is let go, and it shrinks? Well, it's because the rubber is made of a lot of different strands. It's a polymer. And when you stretch it, what you do is you impart an order to those strands, which goes—and as soon as you let go, it goes back to the disordered state. That actually creates a force. <br><br> The spontaneity, the just-happeningness, when you let go of the rubber band, there is a just-happeningness to its shrinking. That's the taste of entropy. It just happens. It goes right down the stream. It falls into existence. So I think that the stream in this dharma song is the natural— is the force of nature itself that is constantly calling us to enlightenment. Now, you could take a Christian perspective, because they say that God's always calling you, vocation, okay? Whether you can hear the call or not. So I think let's take that to be the stream, and of course, merrily, merrily, means that you— that's the happy that I claimed is the one word that describes everything. Life is but a dream. <br><br> That means featherlight and paper thin, which is insight into impermanence and emptiness. But you know, the interesting thing is it encourages you to row your boat in addition to just go down the stream. So when you row the boat, you are exercising control through the oar. <br><br> So do you know what the— why should you know? What a stupid question. What's the Greek word for someone who rows or control— who steers the boat? The Greek word. Well, you will recognize it because it's in English, but the person that controls the boat is called the kubernetes. That's what's given us the word cybernetics. It also has given us the word governor, like in the Watt governor. Controllers are called governors, like a thermostat. <br><br> Okay, it's a controller, it's a governor, engineering-wise. So the encouragement to row your boat, I would take to mean, yes, and also in addition to flowing down the stream of enlightenment, exercise control with regards to how you carry yourself in the world. So the entire dharma, you're absolutely correct. And like I say, I am sure that this was intentional, part of the school teachers in the 1950s, who mostly were Buddhists. Thank you. </p>
