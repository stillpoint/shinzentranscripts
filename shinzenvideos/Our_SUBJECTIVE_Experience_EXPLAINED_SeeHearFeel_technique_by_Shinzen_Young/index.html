<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Mental images, mental talk, emotional body sensation. So in general, if you look from the side, mental images tend to be sort of centered here, but they can be around your surroundings, and they can also be back where your body is. But memory-planned fantasy tends to sort of be up and in front. Talk tends to be posterior and up, and then the emotional body is primarily down with the body. So very, very roughly speaking, you've got a triangle like this. It's an oversimplification, but it's a way of thinking about it. This is the center of the inner space, but the inner space can be broad, it can be quite wide, actually. So emotional body space is just the space of your body. Some people have emotional centers, places in the body where pleasant or unpleasant emotional sensations would likely be most prominent. Some people don't have emotional centers. If you have emotional centers, then bringing yourself to your emotional body means some awareness strongly in those centers and some awareness peripherally over the body. If you don't have emotional centers, then just awareness in your body in general is to be in emotional body space. Talk space is typically ill-defined, but most people sort of point at their ears, their head, this area, it's the phallic. So abstractly and in an oversimplified schematic view, we can think of image space, talk space, emotional body space. Our descriptive word for visual thinking is mental image, but our label is see in. Our descriptive word for auditory thinking is mental talk, but our label is hear in. And our descriptive word for emotional body sensation is emotional body sensation, however the label is feel in. So whenever I think about this system, I sort of get this image of the triangle. But I also get the phrase that this system is reactive, proactive, interactive, and occasionally inactive. If you get this, you will have such a handle on life. Such a handle on life. Because every heaven and hell that you will experience between now and the moment you die will somehow involve the four things that I just mentioned within this system. It's reactivity, it's proactivity, it's interactivity, and it's occasional inactivity. So let's see what that means. It means if you have external sounds, external sights, and physical body sensation, it could trigger one, two, or all three of these at the same time. So it reacts to the physical senses. Producing what? Well if that reaction is unconscious and solidified, it produces the sense that there is a self that hears, sees, and is physically contacted. So if you're in pain, and this system is reacting to the pain, judging it, awfulizing it, and having rhythmic reactions such as fear, tear, irritation, helplessness, and so forth. So that's the self, alright? That's this system reacting to a physical contact, a physical world. So as a reactive system, when it activates, and it's not experienced with concentration, clarity, and equanimity, it will convince you that you have a limited self that is seeing, hearing, and in a physical world. So on the other hand, we're not trying to get rid of this activity. It can activate to the max, but as long as there's clarity, concentration, and equanimity, in other words, as long as you have a complete experience of self. And by the way, equanimity is none other than total self-love and total self-acceptance in this regard. So if it reacts and you experience it fully, then you love it to death. It's so active that it's no longer there as a thing. So there's... Okay, so. So that's the reactive system. Every single time you're convinced there's someone inside of you that's a self experiencing an other that is alien and it. At some subtle level, the system is reacting to the physical world. It may be subliminally below the threshold of awareness, and our job is to clarify it and unblock it and love it. That's the reactive. Proactive. Oh, you've noticed this. It's called monkey mind. When it's not reacting to the outside world, it starts spinning memory, plan, fantasy, problem solving. Fantasies basically two kinds. Fantasies that you run to scare you, and fantasies that you run to entertain you when there's nothing else going on. In neuroscience, this is well known, it's called the default network. Default meaning it's what people fall back on when you don't ask them to attend to something in an experiment. They would tell people, okay, now just rest now. Okay, we're having you watch that target, that visual target now, do nothing, just rest. And then they discovered they're not resting. There's all this distinctive activation going on by way of default. So what's happening is monkey mind. Is memory, plan, fantasy, problem solving, etc. So I call that the proactive system, meaning that the system will just go off on its own and spin memory, plan, fantasy. Convincing you that there's a past, convincing you that there's a future, convincing you of many, many things. So that's the proactive side of the system. Once again, we're not trying to get rid of that. We're trying to have a complete experience of that. Then the system is interactive. That means a mental image could trigger an emotional body sensation. Mental thought could trigger an emotional body sensation. Emotional body sensation could build until you just have to make a comment about it, or have a picture of it. A mental image could trigger a comment. A mental thought could make a picture to accompany it. So the arrows point both ways. This is the interactivity of the system. And once you become familiar with the system, you can start to track how this will trigger this, and then this will lead to this, etc., etc. So that's the interactivity. And becoming clear about this is knowing yourself at a sensory level, at a system theoretic level. This is the system theoretic paradigm for thoughts and emotions. Then the last phrase is occasionally inactive. Actually more than you might imagine. For brief moments, the system turns off hundreds and hundreds of times during the day. When you just hear, just see, just experience physical touch, for just a second, the system actually evaporates. But people usually don't notice it. So it doesn't help them. They don't realize that the self winks in and out of existence during the day. So when it goes inactive, we have a no-self state. But unless you consciously experience it, it won't be liberating. So we want you to be able to notice when it's active and inactive. So that's the subjective system, and that's what we're going to work on today. I'm going to show you how to work individually and collectively. So if we draw a column, we're going to use in as an abbreviation for inner arising. We use see to refer to visual experience. It's a verb of visual perception. Hear is the verb of auditory perception. Feel is the verb for somatic perception. So see in for mental images. Hear in for mental thought. Feel in for emotional body sensation. We can work individually, and then we could broadly float. We'll call this focus in, within the whole system. So let me say that most people have quite a bit of hear in. That's where we're going to start. So we're going to know hear in each time the mental talk arises. When the mental talk comes to an end, gone. That's the period at the end of the sentence. And then if there is no mental talk, hear rest. Sometimes people find that by placing attention in talk space, it sort of like turns off the mental talk. That's not suppression. It just is. It just happens that way. So you'll hear rest. You'll listen to that restful state. Otherwise, hear in, gone. Some people find that after the gone, there'll be a restful state. Some people find that there's immediately a new arising of the next word or phrase or sentence. So you'll hear in, gone, hear rest. That's how we can work individually with this. This is actually pretty straightforward. Mental images and emotional body sensations require a bit of clarification. First and foremost, if you're new to practice, you may not have many mental images. And that's not a problem. You just may not have many of them. So we're going to have you focus on the dark, bright, in front of, behind your closed eyes, which is, you'll recall, is see rest. Focus on that if you don't have any mental images. But if you do have mental images, we'll note that as see in. If all or even part of the mental image drops away or drops off, then gone. You'll note the vanishing of all or part of the image. If you don't have many mental images, then fine, you'll just be see rest, see rest until they occur. Remember, however, that if you have memory, plan, or fantasy, you probably are seeing the memory scene, probably seeing the fantasy and so forth. We don't call it imagination for nothing. But it may be very vague and fleeting, just a ghostly impression. That's see in. People often think that, oh, mental images, it must be clear like a photograph or like looking at a physical object. Only for some people, the great majority of people, the mental images are these vague, wispy, diaphanous impressions of form that disappear very quickly. And that's see in, that's image. Remember also that if you are aware that you're in any particular place, if you're convinced you're in a room with people at a certain location, you probably get some vague image of your surroundings that's see in. And when you have body sensations, you probably get a sense of your overall body and your appearance. In addition to the sensations of the body, there's the image of the body. Once again, often rather vague and ill-defined. That's see in also. So that's that. Feel in is, there's a lot to be said about this. So at any given instant, somewhere in consciousness, you may experience emotion. The alternative is at any given instant, you're not experiencing any emotion. If you're not sure, assume you're not experiencing any emotion. So at any given instant, you may have an experience of emotion. That emotion may be well-defined qualitatively or ill-defined qualitatively. It may be intense or it may be subtle. Quite where that emotion is occurring may be well-defined or it may be ill-defined. However, at any given instant, you either have an emotional experience or you don't. If you're not sure, assume you don't. If you are having an emotional experience, it is possible that part of that emotional experience will involve body sensations, a change in your body. If so, our label for that body sensation is feel in. It is possible that you have an experience that you'll say is emotional, but it's mental only and does not affect the body. In which case, there is no emotional sensation in the body. The emotion is completely mental. That could happen. In that case, when we work with this, and you're having a mental emotion, but there's nothing that impacts your body. Your body is emotionally restful. So we'll call that feel rest. If you go to your body and try to figure out which sensations are physical and which are emotional, you may be able to do that, but you probably won't. It will probably just be crazy to try to figure that out. Somewhat depends on the individual. The way that I set up this category, feel in, is not specifically I'm asking you to go to the body and figure out what's physical, and more generally what's emotional. If you can do that, fine, but most people, it's like, it doesn't compute. However, here's something anybody can do. At any given instant, you ask yourself, am I experiencing emotion? Somewhere. Well defined, ill defined, okay, am I experiencing emotion? The answer is yes. Is any part of that experience, does any part of that experience involve body sensation? The answer will either be yes or no. If you're not sure, the answer is no. If the answer is yes, that's feel in, and that's what to focus on. If the answer is no, then when we play this technique, your body is emotionally neutral. That is a flavor of rest. There are basically three flavors of rest that can come up in the body. Physical relaxation, emotional neutrality, and the sense that there are parts of the body that aren't there, or that your body is disappearing. Those are the three basic flavors of feel rest. When we do this, if there is no emotion in your body, then feel rest. It is quite common for people to, when they try, when they do see in, that they mostly just see rest. It is quite common when people do feel in, that they mostly just feel rest. In other words, the syntheties don't activate. This usually activates, but sometimes it doesn't even. Now, are you going to make it a problem that there is nothing but rest within this system? Please don't. Someday it will activate, I promise you. Now, so a common complaint is, well, when I do formal practice, and I try to work with my subjective experience, it's all rest. The system doesn't activate. It goes inactive during formal practice. Or this part might be active, but these other two parts aren't. During formal practice, I can never get the feel in or the see in going. So I have a, but then in daily life, of course, it is going, but I don't have the wonderful situation of being in formal practice to work with it. So what should I do? So what is my standard recommendation for this situation? Do nothing. Yeah. Or, in other words, of course, the do nothing is okay. You can just accept the fact that nothing is happening. But let's say that you want to be in a formal practice situation, and you want to be able to at will activate and control the direction and intensity of the subjective reactive system. Okay, which would be a way of working smart, a way of training where you're in control, so that when the reactive system gets activated in daily life, you sort of train yourself in ideal situations. Well, what I recommend is that you expose yourself to emotive sounds or emotive sights that activate the system. Sound is the best, because you can do it with your eyes closed. It's easy to detect the images. So I usually recommend something like flipping around the TV and then getting things that activate pleasant or unpleasant. Feel in, you'd be amazed how many images you have if you listen to the soundtrack of a movie. Your mind would just immediately try to see what's going on, okay? And so it activates the whole system. And that way you train yourself to work with the system, and you can have the best of both worlds, because you're in a formal practice situation, and you're in control of the type, duration, and intensity of the stimulus for the system. So if you come to me and say, I'm not getting a carryover into life, I'm going to ask you, well, have you tried media practice? Have you tried training for life's impacts in stillness? I call that working smart. So at the retreat, if not much activates when we explore this, that's fine. We'll just do the rest of the thing. But there are ways to intentionally activate it, and not necessarily in negative directions either, just all sorts of interesting things can be done. So that's the subjective system. Yes? Can we, while training here for a life situation, can we imagine ourselves in those situations, and then that system gets activated? I understand. That, the intentional, as a general principle, intentionally controlling the system is only something we do as focus on positive, which we'll be starting in the afternoon. However, I said as a general principle. People will sometimes ask, well, can I activate it by sort of thinking about a certain something? I would say it's OK to do that occasionally. I wouldn't make that the centerpiece of your practice. Yes? In terms of feel, you're talking about the emotional body. What's the distinction between a headache and the emotional body, or is that part of the emotional body, or that thing? OK, good. That's a good question. The way you know it's an emotional body sensation is by following that little procedure that I just gave you. In other words, if you ask yourself, am I experiencing an emotion? And then you go to the body and see if any part of that is in the body. In other words, you didn't have an emotion, then an emotion arose. What changed in the body, that's the emotional body sensation. The places to look are reactions. If there's a sound and you're smiling, that's an emotional sensation in the body. If there's a sound in the environment and you're irritated by the sound, and it's not just mental comment about it, but you actually have an irritation in the body, that's emotion in the body. In general, I will give you a list of a dozen or so common situations where there is likely to be an emotional sensation in your body. Anger. When you experience anger, where do you usually experience it in your body? Are you asking me? Yeah. How would you answer? OK, good. So that's an emotional body sensation. Fear. That's an emotional body sensation. Sadness. That's an emotional body sensation. Joy. That's an emotional body sensation. Enthusiasm, interest. Not sure? OK. Shame, embarrassment. OK. You got it. All of those are emotional body sensations. Physical pain? No. That's a physical body sensation. However, if it causes an emotional reaction, then that could happen. So how do you work with that? Let's say I start to sit, I mean I came in with some physical pain, I start to sit and then I have emotional reaction to physical pain. It's not something I bring up, it's not something that starts when I sit. Am I making any sense? Are you asking how to work with the pain or... Or the emotional reaction to it. OK. So in other words, let's say that you're doing the feel-in technique. OK. So you are... the instruction is if you have what seems to be emotional body sensation you focus on. So now the pain, what flavors of emotion does the pain cause you? Fear. Fear. Now you're very precise. So now you're going to be aware that the pain is one thing and the fear reaction to the pain is another thing. You're going to note that as feel-in. The fear reaction. That sensation. Then what does note mean? Note means acknowledge and then focus on that sensation. As you focus on that sensation you attempt to accept that sensation. The fear sensation. Remember I said reactive? So you're looking for the body reacting to the body. In this particular case. And then what do you do with it? Just try to make friends with it as best you can. Now, that's only one way to focus of course. You might want to focus on the mental images triggered by the pain. Or the mental talk triggered by the pain. You also might want to focus on the pain itself. Or you might want to focus away from the pain onto a rest state. All of these are options. Just be clear which one you're doing. Did that answer your question sufficiently? OK. Excellent. Yes. I just want to clarify if we were working with this procedure. And we were having a lot of rest in C-in. And a lot of rest in feel-in. We would not be noting that because we're not focusing on the rest. There's actually four procedures on the board. So let's be clear what we're talking about. This is one option. This is another option. This is another option. This is another option. Right. OK. So if you're doing this, the instruction says, if you don't have any activation, note the corresponding restful state. But if you do have an activation, then note the activation. Of course, if you did it for a while and there wasn't any activation, then you might want to switch technique because you're essentially not just noting the restful state. OK. Same thing for here. The instruction says it's crystal clear. As long as you're doing this procedure, which could be for two minutes or two years, however long you want to be doing it, if there's mental talk, you're in. When it disappears, go off. If there's no mental talk, you're at rest. And you just do that. And then if it doesn't seem productive, you do something else. Crystal clear? Excellent. Yes. If you're in the rest state and you want to activate more active state, you recommend, like, turn on the TV. Can you use your imagination? Can you pretend you're in a traffic jam? Actually, that question was just asked a few minutes ago. But I'll answer it again. In general, you are passive with regards to these things. You just let them, when you do this technique. So you are waiting for activation to occur. If it doesn't occur, then you just note the corresponding restful state. However, if you find that the system hardly activates when you do practice in stillness, and you want to do something to sort of stimulate it so that you can observe it and practice up with it, then I recommend media practice. You can listen to a TV or something like that to get things stirred up. But that would just be a sort of special thing that you would do to help train your skills. Is that clear? As far as intentionally bringing something up in order to have something to focus on with this, that was asked over here. I said it's okay to do that occasionally, but it's not really the way to do this. Okay. Good. Yes. Sorry, I had a brain lapse. What does in at the top stand for? Inner activation. So this technique is see in here and feel in. Focus. Focus in. Thank you. Focus, as it stands now, when something is prefixed by focus, it means broadly float within that theme or that sensory modality. Otherwise, we see the specified in the box. Okay, good. Good to go.</p>
