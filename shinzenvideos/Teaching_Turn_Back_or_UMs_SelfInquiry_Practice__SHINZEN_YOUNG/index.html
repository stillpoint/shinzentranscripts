<p>Hi, I'm Devin. How are you? It's been a while. There you are. Here I am. So, I want to say how I love the use of language to point to experience. And yet, a couple of days ago, Juliana was guiding, what is it, now it's see, hear, feel, back, as opposed to self. And there was an interesting way in which she was guiding this. It was a reverse. It was instantaneous. It was like a pinprick. It was the opposite of gone. And that was a different way for me to kind of hear that being presented with language. And my first thought was how you must be enjoying the symmetry of that being the opposite of gone. Because how many times do we talk about it? You go, if there's no symmetry, there's beauty in symmetry. So, I did kind of go, oh, Shenzhen must really be loving that. But I also said, when we're doing turn back, as opposed to gone, we have to kind of break through that sense of observing self in a way we don't with gone. And what was really interesting to me about... It's true. And so, what I liked about the quick, she'd say, quick stab at the past, and also it was the past. It wasn't, oh, I think there was a mention of reversing the direction of where you see perception coming from, but this notion of it being past in time. Of course, we've got our time-space metaphor there. But I was kind of interested in this languaging and how it helped get to a certain experience. But I've had an experience with this technique that I'd like to help guide people to. And what I thought this was helpful for was when I first did this technique, which was you and I had a conversation about 21 years ago where you were talking about the koan you used, like who am I. And you gave me privately, I had a koan, who is... It was looking, listening, and feeling. It was a different time. And who was, we could say now, see, hear, feeling. And the moment I would ask the question, there would be this separation of not just observer and subject, but of self and observer. So the observer was kind of back here or up somewhere, and I came to you and you went, yeah, yeah, yeah, but look at that observer. The observer is just what we would now call see, hear, feel, or talk, image, feel is what you said then. Yeah, but the observer is just talk, image, feel. And I broke that apart and went, yeah, there really isn't anything there. And then every time I asked the question, instead of it being this instant separation that had this lovely equanimity in the middle, instead of that, now there was a, there wasn't an observer. There was more of an abiding in an aware, an empty awareness. And from which, and there was an abiding. It wasn't a quick jab. It was an abiding. And so what I was interested in that kind of reverse, like Julianne would go reverse, reverse, and that to me tended to take people to that first thing that I experienced. And I have a lot of students and clients who get that. Oh, the observer is back here. And if I say, yeah, but it's really just, you know, if I try to tell them what you told me, everyone doesn't have the chops to do that. And I wondered if you had some languaging that's as effective as the, hey, like gone, like reverse, to help people kind of drop into an, which is my experience of it. It's kind of an abiding. It isn't a quick, it's a, oh, yeah, I can hang out there. So that's my question. What's good in languaging to help people or are you assuming that once they kind of do that, they'll just fall in? The way that I typically treat this issue is in a sense to sidestep it, but not really. I'll explain. So the broader perspective on this kind of thing is that different languagings of a certain direction that someone would like to point, who's a coach, teacher, different languagings work for different people at different times.
