<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Okay, so you mentioned you wanted to work on some specific issues. Anything you'd like to just tell me briefly about those issues before we start to work in terms of what it is and what your goals would be in working on it? Yeah, what I'm working with now is a strong feel component that has, you might call it touch, I sometimes call it secondary feel, but that tension that comes around the feel can lock into quite a dramatic degree. When it first arose, it seemed triggered by external event, but what I, it's a response, an emotional response to an event, but I think it became clear that as I processed it, that it kind of worked as a magnet to draw years to who knows what other stuff up with it that matched that emotional frequency. And then for a while now, several days, I've been working with it. I let go of there having to be any talk image component. And it's just a huge amount of feel which I have techniques and ability to process, but it's quite a significant event and I thought, ah, time to call in the big guns. And I thought you could help me with this and maybe someone could benefit from that help. Let me ask some questions so I can make sure I understand the situation. You're having a lot of emotional type body sensation, what I call feel, but I think that you're saying that you have a muscle tension reaction to that feel when it arises. I think there's a very, very strong feel and because it is so nonstop and intense that the body just starts to tighten around it in a way that I'm working not only with the feel, but I have to kind of work with the tightening that comes around it. And so I might work with one, then work with the other, but there's no question the core is feel and everything else is just because it's been so intense for so long, the body's just starting to, and I'm literally now experiencing physiological things in the body just simply from that tightening around the feel. Does that make sense? Yes. So I have to work with this sensory phenomenon, the underlying emotional sensations or feel as we would put it in the technical vocabulary, body sensation that seems emotional. And then there's a kind of physical response in the form of muscle tension. And that muscle tension, some people consider that to be a purely physical sensation, but because it's so linked with the emotions, some people consider it to be in and of itself an emotional sensation. We can parse it either way depending on what's natural for that person. I have a few other questions to ask you. It sounds to me like you've already been working with it in the way that I would consider optimal. By that I mean that you're sometimes focusing on the tension reaction, sometimes focusing on the underlying feel itself, which is the general strategy of divine and conquer. I've been using a lot of, flow is probably where my natural strength is. And I can work with flow and almost immediately have some kind of response to that of going into it. But then it re-arises and re-congeals so I thought, okay, I've got to maybe work more deeply or maybe you can just help me. Well, probably the strategies that you are using are already optimal. That's my guess. It's simply a matter of continuing with them. But let's just do some interactive stuff and we'll see what comes up. I'm not sure that there's actually anything new to add content wise. It may just be a numbers game of continuing what you're now doing. But like I said, let's see what happens. I do have a couple more questions. Does the tension reaction that you're referring to, does that tend to come up in a pronounced pattern in real time or is it more of an ongoing sort of situation? By that I mean, is there a clear sense of there'll be an eruption of feel and then there's a tension, eruption of feel, then there's tension. Or is it that the tension is sort of there in a fairly ongoing way? Or does it tend to fluctuate moment by moment with the fluctuations in the feel? A little bit of the second, a little bit of the third. The feel is pretty continuous, pretty intense, but there is a rising and falling depending on if I'm able to give it, if I'm able to stop and go into it, sometimes it might multiply and affect times 10 and become quite more than what you wanted to deal with, but I'm assuming that's a part of the process. Sometimes my work with it will help it flow. The tension does not correspond directly to the feel and what I'm calling the tension is just from the feel having been so consistent, there's a kind of a not breathing and a tensing in that's creating stuff in the back. So it's not really a moment by moment physical muscle tensing around emotional body sensation. It's more the result that the emotional body sensations have been ongoing for so long that you're getting this secondary sensation. Yes, and there may be a subtle other, from what I'm describing, the thing that I'm aware of is, oh, then literally parts of my body start to hurt and I know it's just from the body just getting tired, the body kind of getting tired from working with the feel. Okay. Now, let me ask some other questions. You talk about the feel breaking up into flow and I'm assuming that happens with some consistency? Oh, you know, whenever I focus in on it, yes. How about the tension reaction? Does it break up into flow? If I'm focusing towards that, yes. That can break up into flow as well. They all do kind of like a rubber band snap back into place a lot.
