<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>It's interesting too because when I had a physical issue a year ago where I had excruciating pain in my body, what happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned, was singeing very hot. And the neurologist and everybody said it was probably in response to the pain. They said it's just your body's in an alarm alert mode. That's getting activated by this fear. So like I have that in addition, so you're talking about hot, you know. I've got that on the outside, this kind of singeing. That will definitely, that directly corresponds with the intensity of the feeling. So that's enough, isn't it? It's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information. Do you think that it's interacting with subtle levels of talk or image? Very very subtle. What do you mean interacting? By that I mean that the fear and sadness might be intensified by subtle subliminal activations of visual or auditory thinking. What I think is happening, and this is just having been working with it now for a while, I think it's like if there's a deck of cards that's all the images and thoughts that we have in a pool that one hit something and it went down and if there were like little shavings of metal, I'm sorry I went back away from deck of cards, little shavings, all of those came up and each one of those is an image or it could be image or talk stuff, but it's just like, and so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be enough to go, oh yes, that's when I was five. That's exactly what I mean by that. And when that comes up it can poke, it can, it can kind of like add a little bit of a wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might poke in the feel a little bit, but if I stay with the feel they just kind of hang out. So the answer to the question is yes, there is interaction with subtle image, which is significant, and also characteristic of catharsis, although it may primarily come up as body feel flavors, subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the gestalt, especially the visual, because people don't usually hear hell, they usually see hell, although in theory you can hear it too, but image space is where the monsters are that might be linked to all of this. So that gives me some of the more information that I need. Okay now believe it or not, yet more questions, okay, because well, because we've got to see what's really going on and I don't. You're doing your house. Yeah, well you interviewed me. You're doing your house MD. This is called differential diagnosis baby. These are my huge diagnostic skills. Okay so, let's see here. Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear that was pervasive through the body so dissolved into flow that it no longer caused you suffering? Yes. How about sadness? Have you ever done that? Okay, so then you've already done what we're going to be working towards. We're going to be working towards that experience yet again, because it's a matter of, I mean basically, what, let's see, one, two, three, four, maybe there's four kinds of human beings. I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans, right? But maybe one way to classify all human beings is there's most human beings who have never had the experience of physical pain flowing so completely that it turned into a flavor of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. Most humans have never had that experience. So that's most humans. Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once. Then there are the humans that have had that same experience but with regards to rage, terror, or grief. That's a whole other thing than physical pain in terms of what it's like when that breaks up. So we've determined that... And I think harder. Incomparably harder. Because pain is just pain. The emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and distort us. They've been honed by evolution for that task. That's what hell is. Hell is rage, terror, grief, shame, flavors that have become so activated that they're able to convince you that not only will this be all you ever experience from now on, they're actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else. They have that much distorting power so that it seems like eternal in both directions. That would be hell. Purgatory is when you've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that illusion anymore, but they're still there and you're working with them. And then the threshold between purgatory and heaven is when it turns into flow that we've been talking about. So believe it or not, one other question, besides fear and sadness, are there hints of any other flavors in there? Like anger or shame specifically? I've actually looked specifically for them. I think the shame flavor can... Like if something happens in the extra world that embarrasses me, I feel that shame and that can trigger all this. Is it part of the present gestalt, the shame flavor, or is it pretty much we're dealing with sad and had? If we call fear had. Just for alliteration. I know, I'm going to go for it. Because there's mad, sad, glad, and had. You're changing my feel flavors here. Don't worry. It's okay. They'll come back. I'll get back to hell soon. Okay. Here's what's interesting. You know that heat I talked about in the body? It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flesh. And so it can trigger it. So they all kind of interlinked in that way? It's all information that I need to do the guidance. And I think I have enough.</p>
