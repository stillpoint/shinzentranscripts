<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>People sometimes ask, how can I know if a teacher is really qualified? How can I know if a teacher has had a liberation experience? Well, actually, merely having a liberation experience doesn't necessarily make you qualified to be a teacher. And not having liberation doesn't necessarily exclude you from being a good teacher. I use two criteria to sort of guess whether a person has had a liberation experience or not. Notice that I say guess. I can never be really sure, but I can make a pretty good guess. The two criteria that I use are body language and personal behavior. Now, the body language is fairly easy. All you've got to do is look at them, listen to them, and so forth. The personal behavior piece is hard, because you'd have to hang out with them. You'd have to actually be their wife or their secretary or their husband or their child, something like that, to really know the personal behavior. You'd have to be close to that person over a long period of time. Knowing the personal behavior is only something you can do in a relative way, unless you happen to have a very special close relationship. Maybe a familial relationship. So it's a combination of the flow of emptiness and impermanence expressing itself in that person's body language, voice, gaze, and so forth. That plus their personal behavior would be the two criteria I would look for to judge levels of enlightenment. Even then, like I say, I can only guess, but I can be fairly confident in those guesses. There's a tricky thing, though, about the body language piece. I'll tell you an interesting story. I was once driving in Santa Monica, California with a senior student of mine. If you don't come from California, you might not know, but there's a lot of homeless people in Santa Monica. In Southern California, they make it a comfortable place for homeless people. They're known for that. So there's all these homeless people there. We saw this homeless person, and we looked at each other. It was one of those weird psychic moments where we knew we had had exactly the same thought. We had, actually. We knew it. The thought was, if you clean this guy up, put him in white clothes, put him in front of an audience, and don't let him say anything, but just let him sort of do his thing, he would have something very close to the body language of an enlightened master. Now, that may be very shocking and off-putting for some people to hear. Notice I said the body language, not the mental state. Apparently, a combination of mental illness and harsh life had more or less driven the ego out of his body. A kind of pseudo-enlightenment, actually, but certainly not enlightenment. You can have somebody that has the body language of no-self, but not really have a classical, clear enlightenment-type consciousness inside of them. Now you see why vibe is not enough. Then there has to be the behavior. The behavior of that person was of a homeless, helpless, ineffectual street person living by begging. So that's not the behavior, typically, of a qualified teacher. In terms of, well, okay, besides, sort of, is this person capable of dealing with the enlightenment issue, how do you know they're qualified? Well, the very first thing that pops into my head if somebody asks me, how do you know if a teacher is qualified, is look at the students. The virtue of a teacher is only in the results that that teacher can get with students, as far as I'm concerned, because there aren't any teachers. There's just the activity of teaching. And so what's the effect? How are their students doing? Somebody once asked Tony Robbins what his qualifications were for doing what he does. He's a, you may know, a well-known self-help speaker. And he said, because, I don't know, maybe there was an implication, hey, you don't have any degree, you don't have any credibility, what gives you the right to tell people what to do? And he said, well, I have a degree in results. I like that answer. That's what I look for. By those standards, there are some very enlightened teachers, very enlightened individuals who are not very good teachers. And there may be some teachers that haven't had a whole lot of enlightenment or haven't had the deep experiences of some of the great masters, but they get really good results with people. And they can deal with anything that a student is likely to go through. So I would say those are the things that come to my mind. Look for body language. And maybe that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to you. You don't know what I'm talking about. It's something you develop a sensitivity to. Unfortunately, it's a little bit of a catch-22. You don't know what to look for until you start to become a little bit that way yourself. Basically what you're looking to see is, is there a flow of empty energy that's animating this person? That's the body language. But that alone is not enough because they might just be crazy. So then you have to look for behavior. Are they a mensch? Are they an ordinary good person?
