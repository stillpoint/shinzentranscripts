    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=0) |  What is the origin of the word vipassana? |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=8) |  Literally, if we look at the etymology, that is to say, the origin of the word vipassana, |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=18) |  we can analyze it into the prefix vi- and the word passana. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=26) |  Passana means seeing. It comes from the root pas in Pali or pas in Sanskrit, which means to see. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=39) |  Paschati is to see. And although it might not be immediately evident, |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=45) |  actually that root in Sanskrit, paschati, is related both to the Latin specere, speck, |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=59) |  which means to see. Speck becomes, spash becomes pasch in Sanskrit. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=65) |  And it's related to the Greek scope, skeptos, that kind of thing. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=71) |  Essentially, the ka sound of Indo-European can sometimes become a sha sound in Sanskrit. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=80) |  So that's how you get speck becoming spash, becoming pasch. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=87) |  And vi has several meanings. It's actually derived from dvi. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=97) |  And dvi is the same root that gives us duo or the English word two, which is really two, right? T-W-O. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=109) |  So the dv and the tw are the Indo-European root that means two or separate or apart. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=119) |  So the corresponding Greek word is dia, D-I-A, which would have been pronounced dia in ancient Greek. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=133) |  If you look at how dia is used in forming words in English, dia has a meaning of through. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=142) |  For example, diathermy is to send heat through a person as a healing modality. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=151) |  On the other hand, dia also means apart or separate. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=156) |  For example, a diagnosis is to know separately or to know distinctly. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=162) |  A diacritic is a distinguishing mark, something that allows you to separate similar things. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=173) |  So not surprisingly, the corresponding prefix in Sanskrit, vi, means those two things. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=185) |  It means both separate and through. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=189) |  So literally, vipassana would mean to see separately, but it would also mean to see through. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=200) |  So to see separately, in my interpretation, is the ability to separate the basic sensory elements of experience, |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=211) |  which I like to classify in terms of touch, sight, sound, feel, image, and talk. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=224) |  I've described the meanings of those elsewhere. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=228) |  So vipassana in the sense of separate sensory elements, we can also have even finer separations. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=236) |  Different flavors of feel can be separated, different flavors of touch. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=244) |  You can distinguish different kinds of images, images that are of people, places versus objects, and so forth. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=255) |  So to separate the sensory strands is one meaning of vipassana, to see separate. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=261) |  But vipassana also means to see through. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=266) |  That means that once you separate a strand, you intently focus on that strand, |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=272) |  and your awareness soaks into its interstices. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=276) |  That has the effect of causing it to soften, dissolve, so that it shows you its empty and vibrant nature. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=289) |  That seeing through or soaking in aspect also has the effect of reaching down into the subliminal neuronal circuitry, |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=307) |  into the unconscious itself, so that there's a kind of trickle-down of clarity |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=312) |  down to the depths of one's subconscious levels of processing. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=321) |  So I take vipassana to mean the twofold endeavor of separating strands and then soaking into those strands |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=331) |  and literally seeing through their somethingness. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=335) |  Now vipassana also has a third meaning. The V can be combined with pasana to mean insight. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=346) |  In other words, the aha or wisdom experience, the change in paradigm that we call no-self |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=358) |  or insight into the marks of existence or enlightenment. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=363) |  That change in paradigm, that wisdom or insight, is also implied by the word vipassana. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=374) |  So vipassana means, as I like to interpret it anyway, it means separate, see apart, see through, |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=385) |  and see into your true nature or insight. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=388) |  And it has all three of those meanings in one word. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=394) |  So we don't have anything like it in English. There's no English equivalent. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=399) |  There's no word in English that means separate your sensory experience into natural components, |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=406) |  soak your awareness into those components, and as the result of that you will experience a paradigm shift called wisdom. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=415) |  Vipassana means all of that as one word. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=420) |  So in my usage I essentially use vipassana and mindfulness as synonyms. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=430) |  Now strictly speaking, historically, the word mindfulness goes back to sati or satipatthana, |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=436) |  it goes back to a different word, but really the notions in my way of thinking are essentially the same. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=448) |  The way I like to set up my definition of mindfulness involves the separating, the soaking into, |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=458) |  which I call the sensory clarity. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=460) |  Of course, in order to do that you have to have concentration power. |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=466) |  And then the equanimity piece is not implied by the word vipassana etymologically, |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=475) |  but in terms of practical considerations, all mindfulness teachers emphasize this sort of gentle matter of fact. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=484) |  Sometimes it's defined as non-judgmental. That's not the term I use, but I prefer the more traditional equanimity term. |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=494) |  But all vipassana teachers emphasize that in addition to the clarification aspects. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuRbQsQxDRk&t=502) |  So that's sort of how I understand the terminology. |
