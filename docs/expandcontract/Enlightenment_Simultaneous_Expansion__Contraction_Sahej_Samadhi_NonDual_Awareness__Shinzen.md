     Harprakash's YouTube channel is called Expand Contract. Usually when things expand spatially, they thin out simultaneously. That gives you a simultaneous expansion contraction flavor. A vastness all around and a thinness all throughout. And if you have a vastness all around and a thinness all throughout, everything that you see, hear and feel on the inside and outside while you're walking around in life, I would pretty much define you as an enlightened person. That's sahaja samadhi. That is true non-dual awareness. And if you want the details filled in, you can go to the YouTube channel.
