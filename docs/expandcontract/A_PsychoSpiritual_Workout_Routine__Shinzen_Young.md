    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RRHTbOAhDg&t=12) |  Then you can shift if you want to a focus on restful states, which is a kind of thinned |

    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RRHTbOAhDg&t=67) |  So from the nothingness will arise the positive feel-image-talk in a very natural way. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RRHTbOAhDg&t=75) |  And that sort of completes the cycle. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RRHTbOAhDg&t=79) |  It's sort of like a psycho-spiritual nautilus workout. |

    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RRHTbOAhDg&t=103) |  This sort of hits all the main psycho-spiritual muscle groups, so to speak, and gives a nice |

     You can start with focus on ordinary and just sort of deal with the ordinary sensory experience. Then you can shift if you want to a focus on restful states, which is a kind of thinned out and attenuated version of the focus on the ordinary. And often after you do that, the dynamic aspect will be present. Then you can focus on flow, vanishing, and then the vanishing will point you towards that which is outside of time and space, that which is beyond the human, which could be called zero or nothingness or the source. When a human being touches that nothingness, the natural reaction to that nothingness is joy, love, compassion, and a call to service. So from the nothingness will arise the positive feel-image-talk in a very natural way. And that sort of completes the cycle. It's sort of like a psycho-spiritual nautilus workout. You know the nautilus equipment, you exercise all the main muscle groups. Well focus on ordinary, rest, the dynamic, and then the intentionally creating of the positive. This sort of hits all the main psycho-spiritual muscle groups, so to speak, and gives a nice complete workout for your soul.
