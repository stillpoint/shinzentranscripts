    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=0) |  How can I use this system? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=5) |  You can use this system in one of three ways. |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=8) |  You can either say, well, I don't want to deal with choices at all, |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=12) |  and you pick one technique, and that's what you do. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=15) |  And so the basic mindfulness system was a catalog of techniques, |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=20) |  and you decided to buy one and take it home, and that's it. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=27) |  Another thing you can do is make a little workout sequence for yourself. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=31) |  Think of each one of the five ways as a piece of nautilus equipment, |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=39) |  and you're going to go through this psychospiritual workout cycle every morning, |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=43) |  something like that. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=47) |  The metaphor with physical exercise is actually rather extraordinary. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=53) |  Once you start to make the comparisons, there's at least a dozen places |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=58) |  where the metaphor just works absolutely perfectly, |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=62) |  including ending with focus on positive being analogous to going into the jacuzzi. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=68) |  I mean, it's like perfectly analogous, |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=73) |  because not only is it a pleasant balm after what might be a harsh deconstruction, |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=80) |  but if you think about how exercise works, |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=84) |  exercise doesn't make you strong. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=87) |  Exercise destroys muscle. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=90) |  Exercise is destructive, but it's destructive in a way that helps nature improve. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=99) |  And the observing practices that we do in mindfulness, |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=104) |  they deconstruct self and world, |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=108) |  but in a way that helps nature reconstruct better. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=116) |  One of the things that helps the muscles rebuild in a good direction at the end |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=122) |  is to go into the whirlpool. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=124) |  So one of the things that... |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=126) |  I mean, the deconstruction we do would automatically move you in positive directions anyway, |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=132) |  but you can help it along by ending with this jacuzzi of focus on positive, |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=137) |  which tends to then foster that direction. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=139) |  So it's actually a very nice metaphor. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=142) |  So you can just, by one technique, keep things simple. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=148) |  Okay, I like to do noting restful states, body-mind version. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=154) |  Relaxation, peace, blank, quiet, that's it, that's my practice. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=158) |  Or you can make a little workout sequence for yourself. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=164) |  The natural sequence that I tend to follow is focus in, focus out, |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=173) |  note restful states, focus on change, |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=180) |  and then do nothing, and then end with focus on positive. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=186) |  But you can work out any sequence you want. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=192) |  And then the most complicated way to use it is you sit down and you decide |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=198) |  which of these themes you'd like to pursue, and you start to do it, |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=203) |  and then you either stay with it and that's it, |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=207) |  or interest, opportunity, necessity comes up, and you decide, |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=211) |  okay, I think I'd like to switch to one of the other approaches, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=214) |  and that's a looping and branching algorithm. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=218) |  It gives you a lot of flexibility but at the price of complexity. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=221) |  So simplest thing you can do, just choose one, and that's fine. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=225) |  Any one of these ways at one time historically was an entire path to enlightenment. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=233) |  So it's not like you're going to miss out on something. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=237) |  If you do any one of them assiduously, you should be able to get the classic results. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=245) |  Or you want to be a little more elaborate, |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=248) |  you just hit all the psychospiritual muscle groups and you have this little workout routine. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=253) |  You want to be really elaborate, then we come into the 21st century, |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=258) |  the age of the algorithm. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=261) |  So now it's a flowchart and you're looping and branching |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=265) |  to keep your interest up and to optimize the efficacy. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=270) |  When I interactively guide you, we go to the algorithm, we loop and branch. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y13blvPkv0&t=276) |  Part of the reason that I set up the system this way is to optimize interactive guidance. |
