    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=0) |  How do you deal with the fact that you forget things? |
    | [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=6) |  Sometimes while you're practicing meditation or as the result of practicing meditation, |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=13) |  you remember things from the past that you completely forgot. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=20) |  And sometimes those are emotionally charged. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=25) |  So when they come up in the present, you greet them with equanimity, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=30) |  and there's a sense of what in therapy is called catharsis or releasing. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=37) |  You've heard of economizing. Well, let's start talking about equanimizing. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=42) |  Equanimizing means bringing equanimity, which is non-self-interference, to a sensory event. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=53) |  So something may percolate up from your biography. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=57) |  You greet it with equanimity, you equanimize it, and you get a sense that it's being released. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=63) |  This is sort of in a sense in the classic mode of psychotherapy. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=68) |  Specific biographical material has been uncovered and has been accepted and integrated, and that's catharsis. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=80) |  However, I would say that the bulk of the catharsis, the bulk of the integration, |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=88) |  the bulk of the purification in the depths of our consciousness that comes about through mindfulness practice, |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=98) |  does not take the classic form of specific memories or other material percolating up. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=112) |  Most of it happens without us knowing that it's happening. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=117) |  The classic example in my case is I did a ten-day retreat in the U Ba Khin tradition, |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=127) |  which involves sweeping the awareness through the body. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=130) |  About halfway through the retreat, I noticed that there was a little bit of congestion in my lung area and so forth. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=140) |  Nothing all that big a deal, just some slight discomfort. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=145) |  And I remember briefly thinking, |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=148) |  oh, that must be the effect of all the smoke that I've put in my lungs from the last ten years of smoking marijuana every day. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=158) |  There was no thought of, oh my God, I've hurt my lungs, or gee, I should stop smoking marijuana. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=164) |  Nothing like that at all, just this awareness. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=169) |  And then the retreat went on. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=172) |  But when I got back, a day passed, I didn't smoke any grass, another day passed, I didn't smoke any grass. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=183) |  Finally, many days passed and I realized I just wasn't going to do it anymore. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=189) |  And there was no conscious decision, there was no weighing of cause and effect, |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=196) |  there was no on the wagon, off the wagon, there was no struggle, there was no nothing. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=201) |  The part of my body that was enjoying getting high and the part of my body that was not enjoying being damaged |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=215) |  apparently were allowed to talk to each other without my knowing it |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=220) |  and come to a conclusion that radically, effortlessly, unexpectedly changed a deep-seated behavior pattern. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=232) |  So something happened and the subconscious rewired itself. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=240) |  Sometimes there can be changes that you don't even get a hint of. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=246) |  At least I had a hint in this case. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=249) |  A lot of times you do a retreat and mostly what you're aware of at the retreat is you're physically uncomfortable, |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=257) |  you can't concentrate, you are in emotional turmoil, you're judging yourself, you're judging others, |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=270) |  and all that goes away only because you get sleepy. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=275) |  And that's mostly what your experience was, but then you leave the retreat |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=281) |  and you discover that something in your fundamental alienation, |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=289) |  your separation of inside and outside is gone forever, |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=294) |  your neighbor's been blasting the stereo half the day, |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=298) |  you realize it used to drive you crazy and it doesn't and it's not going to. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=303) |  And changes take place. |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=307) |  While you were doing the practice, you might not have had any hint at all that anything productive was going on. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=314) |  It's just you were uncomfortable, your mind was wandering, |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=317) |  but in that environment you created a situation where those circuits could communicate with each other |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=329) |  and rewire themselves. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=333) |  I make the claim that the bulk of the transformation of the subconscious or depths of our being |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=345) |  typically takes place unconsciously. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=349) |  I call it the trickle-down paradigm for working with the subconscious. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=355) |  We shine the flashlight of mindfulness on the surface of sensory experience |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=360) |  and a certain number of photons go down to the very bottom of the lake |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=368) |  and give the circuits down there what they need to rewire themselves |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=375) |  with the surface either knowing very little or often knowing nothing of the rewiring process. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=385) |  Now, a person might well challenge this point of view, saying, |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=390) |  well, how do you know that's happening? |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=392) |  You're saying something happens but we're not consciously aware of it. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=398) |  I can say there are pink kangaroos in this room but only I can see them. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=406) |  Could you disprove that? |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=408) |  Well, it's non-falsifiable, so it's a meaningless statement. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=412) |  A person might say, well, that the subconscious rewires itself when you're doing meditation |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=417) |  is a meaningless statement because how do you know that's happening if you're not aware of it? |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=424) |  Well, you're not aware of it at the time. You don't know what's going on necessarily. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=430) |  But you are aware of significant permanent positive changes in perception and behavior |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=438) |  after you have left the retreat, and therefore you can hypothesize |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=445) |  that something like this is going on. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=448) |  We can't see electromagnetic fields, but we look at behavior on the surface |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=455) |  and we hypothesize, okay, something like the Maxwell field equations describe what's going on. |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=463) |  Even though we don't see it, we can hypothesize that from the effect. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=468) |  So we can hypothesize reasonably, I would claim, |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=472) |  from the changes in perception and behavior that people experience from the retreat environment |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdkODyvYxRg&t=482) |  that something like this rewiring is occurring. |

     How do you deal with the fact that you forget things?
