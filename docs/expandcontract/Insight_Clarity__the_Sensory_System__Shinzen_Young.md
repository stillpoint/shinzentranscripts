    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=0) |  What are the themes of mindfulness? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=5) |  One of the themes that I have people explore in mindfulness is working with ordinary sensory activity. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=15) |  That would be touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=21) |  These categories naturally organize themselves into certain subsystems. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=28) |  I mentioned in another segment that feel, image, talk is both a reactive and a proactive system. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=39) |  By reactive, I mean when you hear a sound or you're aware of a sight or something physically impacts your body, |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=51) |  it may or may not trigger a mental comment, it may or may not trigger a mental picture, |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=58) |  it may or may not trigger an emotional sensation in your body. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=65) |  If it triggers one, two, or all three of those, then I say that there has been a fit reaction, |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=72) |  a feel, image, or talk reaction to the it of the touch, sight, or sound. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=80) |  It turns out that you can monitor how your sense of subjective self, the sense of being a perceiver, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=90) |  you can monitor how that sense of self arises through different levels of activation of feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=99) |  In the most extreme case, when feel, image, and talk, all three activate very strongly in response to an external stimulus of some sort, |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=111) |  you will typically get a very strong sense of an eye that is perceiving an it over there. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=121) |  However, as you're monitoring feel, image, talk, it could happen spontaneously every once in a while that there is a touch or a sight or a sound |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=131) |  and it doesn't produce any reaction in this system whatsoever. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=135) |  When that happens, you have little or no sense of a perceiving self inside of you. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=143) |  If you monitor those fluctuations, repeat this kind of experiment over and over again, you can get an aha experience |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=153) |  or an insight experience into the mechanism whereby the sense of I am-ness, at least in the sense of a perceiving self, arises. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=165) |  You can have an intense reaction of feel, image, talk, but if there's a lot of clarity so that you keep those components untangled, |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=177) |  and if there's a lot of equanimity, which means that those components are completely unblocked, |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=183) |  there's no suppressing of their arising, but there's no inappropriate holding on to them once they have arisen, that's equanimity. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=193) |  If there's enough clarity and equanimity, even though you would have a huge fit storm, |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=199) |  a huge storm of emotionality in the body, visual mental associations and judgmental chatter in your head, that doesn't turn into a self. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=213) |  It only turns into a self when there's unconsciousness and coagulation or fixation of the feel, image, talk reactions. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=226) |  That's what I meant when I said that these categories can bring insights, as you're observing. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=232) |  Now, not only is feel, image, talk a reactive system, it's also a proactive system. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=241) |  When it's not reacting to touch, sight, sound or some combination thereof, |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=247) |  it usually goes off and begins to spin memory, plan, fantasy, problem-solving, worrying, confusion, etc., etc. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=258) |  Neuroscientists now know about this and call it the default attentional system. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=266) |  It's being studied, but I call it proactive fit. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=271) |  Proactive in the sense that it's not reacting to the environment, it's just going off and spinning past, future and fantasy, basically, plus problem-solving. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=282) |  And then every once in a while, as I mentioned, the fit system is not reactive, it's not proactive, it just spontaneously goes inactive. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=292) |  Then there's just peace, blank, quiet. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=297) |  The body is emotionally peaceful, mental screen is blank, the head is quiet. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=302) |  If you happen to notice the moment that that occurs, which may be very fleeting, you will get what we call insight into no-self. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=312) |  Now, of course, there are some other natural systems here. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=316) |  We can take touch-feel to be your body experience, the ordinary side of your body experience. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=326) |  Then there's also a restful system in your body, which is physical relaxation and emotional peace. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=332) |  Emotional peace is defined as a tangible awareness that your emotional centers are not active. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=341) |  They're in a restful state, they're idling, so to speak. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=346) |  So this gives a system of ordinary experience in the body and restful experience in the body. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=353) |  Then your mental experience is here, your visual thoughts and your auditory thoughts. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=359) |  So this is the ordinary side, image, talk, activity. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=363) |  However, there's a restful system in your mind, which is blank, quiet. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=370) |  The sense of an outer world of sights and sounds, well, that's here. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=379) |  The corresponding restful states are silence and the defocusing of your eyes, the soft focus, with your eyes open, which I call light. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=391) |  One of the themes that I have people work with is different systems of ordinary experience. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=398) |  For example, they could focus in and just work with feel, image, talk, |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=403) |  or they could focus out and just work with touch, sight, sound, or other combinations. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=410) |  I call that theme focus on ordinary. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=414) |  Then by way of contrast, you can work with various restful systems, including the whole thing at once. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=421) |  You could just let your attention freely float among whatever restful states were available, physical relaxation, emotional peace in the body, mental blank, soft focus of your eyes. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=435) |  And if there happened to be quiet or silence around you, you'd have an auditory component to the rest. |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=443) |  The restful states are what most people who don't meditate think meditation is. |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=452) |  Certainly, releasing stress and recharging your battery through enjoying restful experiences is an important component in the meditative endeavor. |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=466) |  That's why I give people these various restful systems to work on, and I call that the theme of exploring rest. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=473) |  However, within the mindfulness tradition, taking ordinary experience and making it extraordinary by working with it using high concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity, |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=488) |  that's also an important way of practicing. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=493) |  It's good because if you want to focus on rest but you can't, there'll be a reason. |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=500) |  The reason is there's too much activity. Well, then you can focus on the activity. |
    | [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=504) |  On the other hand, sometimes people run into this situation where when they practice, not much is coming up. |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=511) |  In that case, how do you keep the edge of clarity and therefore the edge of growth? |
    | [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=521) |  Well, I say when nothing much is happening as you're sitting there, six things are happening. |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=528) |  Your body is physically relaxed. Your body is emotionally peaceful. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=533) |  Your mental screen is blank. Your head is quiet. Your eyes are defocused, and your ears are defocused. |
    | [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=541) |  So you're having six restful experiences all at once. |
    | [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=545) |  By being aware of that, that brings a clarity component into the experience of rest, |
    | [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=552) |  and that clarity component guarantees that there'll be growth in your practice, |
    | [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNetIhxFinw&t=558) |  that you won't get stuck in a good place of just mellowing out year after year without gaining insight and purification. |
