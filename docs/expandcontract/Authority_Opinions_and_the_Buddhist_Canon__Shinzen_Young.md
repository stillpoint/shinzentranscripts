    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=0) |  I hear that sometimes people ask, well, what would Shinzetsu say about this? |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=11) |  That gives me pleasant sensations in a sense, pleasant self-referential sensations, pleasant |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=17) |  feel. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=18) |  But also, immediately when I hear that people say things like that in my talk space is, |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=26) |  don't they realize these are just my casual opinions about things? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=32) |  Don't they realize how little I know about enlightenment? |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=37) |  Don't they realize how little any teacher knows about enlightenment? |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=44) |  I understand that people want to appeal to authority. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=48) |  It's convenient in a sense. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=51) |  Basically, there's traditionally in India and also in the Western world, three bases |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=62) |  for knowing things. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=65) |  There's direct experience, there's logical inference, and then there is reliable authority. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=74) |  What is distinctive about the Buddha as a teacher is that he rejected reliable authority |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=83) |  as a basis of knowing. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=85) |  He essentially said it's direct experience and logical inference. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=90) |  Just because a very good person says something doesn't mean it's necessarily true. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=95) |  Just because some ancient scripture that everybody believes in says something doesn't necessarily |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=101) |  mean it's true. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=102) |  And just because somebody that's meditated for 50 years or 60 years says something doesn't |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=110) |  necessarily mean it's true. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=112) |  It's their casual opinion. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=113) |  It's the best they can come up with. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=116) |  And I think it's really important to keep that in mind. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=119) |  Does that mean that you shouldn't listen to what these teachers say? |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=122) |  No. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=123) |  We have to listen because, yes, there's a lot that can be learned. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=129) |  But it also has to be taken not as some sort of authoritative pronouncement. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=135) |  It's at best a finger that can sort of point, and yes, this person has some experiences |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=142) |  that I don't, or has more experience than I do, so yeah, I can listen to what they say. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=148) |  But to go beyond that, to think that, to make it carry more weight than just that person's |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=155) |  casual opinion or best that they can come up with, I think is to miss the point. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=163) |  We just do our best to formulate things as best we can. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=172) |  So I just wanted to say a couple words along those lines. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=177) |  Yes, you can make use of authority to a certain degree, but I don't think that we need to |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=189) |  give it more clout than it really deserves. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=195) |  Also it's sometimes asked, well, how does what this teacher or that teacher say map |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=204) |  onto what's in the scriptures or what's in the canon? |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=208) |  I guess the Western religions, the Abrahamic religions, tend to call it the scriptures, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=214) |  but in Buddhism they call it the canon. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=217) |  Means the same thing. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=219) |  Unfortunately, the people that are responsible for the Buddhist canon, the Buddha, his immediate |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=226) |  disciples and so forth, are not now alive, meaning we can't dialogue with them. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=234) |  If you ever come to a retreat with me, what you'll see is characteristic of the way I |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=241) |  teach is that when people ask me questions, very seldom do I just give an answer. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=248) |  I sometimes do. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=250) |  But in most cases I find I have to ask a little more. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=257) |  What did you mean by that? |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=261) |  I think I understand what you're saying, but it could be this or it could be that. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=264) |  Could you clarify? |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=265) |  It's very difficult for me to just answer a question directly. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=271) |  I find that interaction is needed. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=274) |  A back and forth is needed. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=278) |  There is no way that we can have a back and forth with the Buddha or his immediate disciples. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=286) |  It's one way. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=288) |  All we've got is what is in these books. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=292) |  These books were not written down right away. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=296) |  It was quite a while before they were written down. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=299) |  Some people might claim, well, it was all perfectly memorized word for word. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=303) |  There is something of that memorizing tradition in the Indic way of doing things. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=310) |  But the fact is, even if it was word for word, that's still not enough. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=316) |  Not really. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=317) |  There would have to be a back and forth to see really how does what, say, I, as Shin |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=324) |  Zen Yang, am teaching, how does that map on to the Buddha? |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=327) |  I'd have to be able to dialogue with him. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=331) |  And I can't. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=332) |  He's gone. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=334) |  So we can look to the scriptures, and yes, we can get a lot from it, and we should. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=341) |  But once again, I have rather modest expectations with regards to how really sharp the communication |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=358) |  can be between the scriptures or the canon and us, given that it's a one-way street. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=366) |  And so it's a kind of humility to understand that, yeah, you can make use of it, but you |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=374) |  can't dialogue with it. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=377) |  And therefore, don't impute more to it than it can deliver in terms of you understanding |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfEFSRNHL5s&t=387) |  the path to classical liberation. |
