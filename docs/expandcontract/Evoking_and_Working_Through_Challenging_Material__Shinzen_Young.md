    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=14) |  that is negatives from memories and so forth, it can only come up as some combination of field |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=25) |  image talk. So you simply apply the focus in technique to it. You untangle the strands, |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=33) |  you open up to them, you give it permission to last as long or as short as it wants. And as you |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=39) |  say, if that's unfinished business, then this finishes the business, or at least is part of |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=46) |  an ongoing process that maybe a year later some more has to percolate up. But you're fostering |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=53) |  the finishing of the business. Or another way to put it is that you're letting the ghosts out of |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=61) |  the cellar and they dissipate and are gone. So typically that's how one deals with negatives. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=74) |  Now when you say focus on negative, okay, that could have a different meaning because focus on |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=81) |  positive means intentionally hold and radiate the positive. So no, there's no technique to |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=91) |  intentionally hold and radiate the negatives in my system. So in that sense, yes, I apologize, |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=98) |  it's asymmetrical. There is something, it's not really a focus on negative because focus on |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=106) |  positive here, attempting to nurture positive content, and there's no way we're going to |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=110) |  nurture negative content. However, there is something that people frequently ask about, |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=116) |  which is, well, do I have to wait for it to spontaneously arise? Can I evoke something |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=123) |  that I know is problematic and then observe it? Then apply the deconstruction practice to it? |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=133) |  The answer is yes, subject to a couple of constraints. The first constraint is I would |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=141) |  not make that the centerpiece of mindfulness practice because then you're doing psychotherapy, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=147) |  you're not doing mindfulness. But it's okay to do that on occasion. The second is to sort of |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=155) |  know how to do it so as to optimize the mindfulness cathartic component. By that I mean, |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=165) |  if you consider, well, you've heard the expression like, what are some of the expressions? Like, |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=176) |  okay, rattle your cage when it's a negative or ring your bell when it's a positive. What does |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=186) |  that mean? If you look at the act, if the bell stands for the samskaras, the stored materials, |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=195) |  so you can with intention strike that bell by bringing up some feel, image, talk, typically a |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=203) |  negative, an issue. So you strike the body-mind bell intentionally, but then it's like hands-off, |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=213) |  and you let it resonate and you observe. You don't strike it again until it completely dies down. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=220) |  And then you strike it again. At some point, you may find this happens. And that could be |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=230) |  actually at the very beginning, in which case you don't beat that dead horse trying to evoke |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=238) |  that thing. The idea is it needs to be something that will resonate on its own readily after |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=245) |  evoking, freeing up all your energy to now apply the technique to it. So you can't be constantly |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=251) |  trying to beat it, like strike it into existence and deconstruct it. But if you find a bell that |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=259) |  resonates, so you strike it and now, however subtly you can still detect it as it damps, |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=277) |  and then strike it again. If at some point you can't evoke it anymore, you're done for that |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=285) |  session. So I call that evoking. And it's not a focus on negative, but it's a little related to |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG1_nyUxj2w&t=291) |  what you brought up. |
