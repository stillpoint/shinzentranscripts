    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=0) |  One day, no work. |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=7) |  One day, no eat. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=20) |  So that was the rule in the Chan monasteries. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=23) |  You had to work. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=26) |  So how are you going to meditate while you work? |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=33) |  They also brought in the Taoist notion of oneness. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=40) |  The oneness of the Tao, the oneness of inside and outside, the oneness of humans with nature. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=49) |  So you bring in the... |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=51) |  The Buddha never talked about oneness. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=55) |  The Buddha talked about freedom from suffering, freedom from limited existence. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=62) |  Never talked about oneness, but oneness is certainly a facet of the practice. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=71) |  Taoism talked about that a lot. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=73) |  So how does that come together? |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=77) |  Well, if you were to do Zen with my teacher, Joshu Sasaki Roshi, one of the first koans |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=87) |  or questions he'd give you is, when you see the flower, how do you become free? |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=95) |  How do you experience one true love? |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=100) |  When you hear the temple bell, how do you experience one true love? |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=106) |  When you chop vegetables, how do you experience one true love? |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=110) |  Notice these are touch, sight, sound things. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=115) |  So while you're working, what do you need to work? |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=118) |  You need touches, sights, sounds. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=122) |  What you don't need a whole lot of is memory plan fantasy. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=126) |  And memory plan fantasy is in feel image talk. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=131) |  It's in your mental pictures, your internal conversations, and your emotions around that. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=136) |  So the idea would be that when you just see or just hear or just touch, as you're working, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=146) |  going about the labors of the day, you could be having experiences of merging, of oneness |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=153) |  with inside and outside. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=156) |  One dualness, because the feel image talk reactive self contracts as the touch, sight, |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=164) |  sound impact of the world expands. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=168) |  So you can have this sort of more Taoist experience of the oneness with nature as you're going |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=173) |  about working. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=174) |  So it's perfect. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=175) |  It brings together the Taoist philosophical perspective with the Confucian work ethic. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=186) |  Part of the focus on ordinary that I give you, where we have touch, sight, sound, that's |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=192) |  to allow you to sort of do that Rinzai Zen thing. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=196) |  As you're driving the car, you can still be in a deep state of meditation. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=203) |  How do you experience one true love when you are driving in smog in Los Angeles? |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgJrjqmrsE&t=209) |  Well, just drive. |
