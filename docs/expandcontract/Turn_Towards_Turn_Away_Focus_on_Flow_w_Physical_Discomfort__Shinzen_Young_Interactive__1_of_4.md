    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=0) |  I like to think of challenges as coming in two types. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=12) |  There are behavioral challenges like, you know, I'm procrastinating or I'm smoking cigarettes |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=18) |  and I want to change the behavior. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=20) |  So I call those behavioral challenges. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=23) |  Then there are what I call sensory challenges, which are because of some condition, some |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=31) |  sensory experiences arising in the body, in the mind, in sight, sound, and so forth. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=38) |  And that's an uncomfortable sensory experience. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=40) |  So it's a challenge in that sense. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=43) |  So in my general formulation, I would say you're experiencing a sensory challenge and |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=50) |  that challenge is uncomfortable touch, defining touch as physical type body sensation. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=55) |  Essentially when a person has a sensory challenge, they have three broad categories of strategies |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=66) |  that can be applied. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=68) |  You can either turn your attention towards the sensory challenge and bring concentration, |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=73) |  clarity, and equanimity to it. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=76) |  That would be a sort of turn towards and you're sort of perfusing the sensory challenge with |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=81) |  mindful awareness. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=83) |  A second strategy could be called turn away, your concentration to focus elsewhere onto |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=89) |  something that's pleasant. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=91) |  For example, you can focus on restful states or focus on the sound of music or positive |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=97) |  emotions and so forth. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=99) |  And I call that a turning away strategy. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=102) |  A third strategy is that you can pay attention to how things change. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=106) |  And it's sort of not this too shall pass, but if you look carefully enough, this is |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=114) |  passing moment by moment. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=116) |  And the passingness of it, both in terms of the sense that it's moving and flowing and |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=121) |  in terms of the sense that each piece of it sort of falls away moment by moment, you can |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=127) |  become so absorbed in the change that pretty soon you're just aware of change and you're |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=132) |  not aware of it. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=134) |  I call that strategy focus on change. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=136) |  So you can turn towards or you can turn away or you can turn towards, you can focus on |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=143) |  change. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=144) |  The tendency is to think, well, if I turn towards it, I'll just make it worse. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=148) |  So I don't want to do that. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=150) |  And then, well, if I turn away from it, I'm just avoiding and denying and suppressing. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=154) |  So I don't want to do that. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=156) |  And I know it's not going to change because it's rock solid. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=159) |  So what's the point of that? |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=161) |  So then the person has set themselves up for failure. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=164) |  Although it is true that it may temporarily get worse if you turn towards it, if you really |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=170) |  give it what it needs, in other words, experience it fully, because that's what mindful awareness |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=175) |  is, is a full experience of something. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=179) |  If you experience it fully, it may get worse, but then it will break up. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=184) |  And then people say, well, if I turn away, I'm denying. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=187) |  But to turn away, you have to develop concentration, right? |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=192) |  Because it takes a discipline to focus on something other than the sensory challenge. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=197) |  And you're not suppressing the sensory challenge. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=199) |  You're giving it permission to be there. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=201) |  You're just not intentionally focusing on it. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=203) |  So you are bringing equanimity to it, even though you're not paying attention to it. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=208) |  And you're also developing sensory clarity to learn how to detect a pleasant, restful |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=212) |  state while you have a huge pain and emotion state. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=217) |  You're learning how to detect subtle, pleasant things that may always be there that you might |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=221) |  not have noticed. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=222) |  The turn away strategy is valid. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=225) |  And as you're turning away, it may cause the thing to sort of cool out, the sensory challenge |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=229) |  to cool out a bit. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=231) |  Then when you use those same skills that you've developed by turning away, you then can apply |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=237) |  the concentration, clarity, equanimity, turn towards. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=240) |  The more cooled out version of it, it may be more penetratable. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=245) |  So the focus away is absolutely as legitimate as focus on. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=250) |  And as far as, well, I know nothing changes as solid as the rock. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=254) |  Well, how carefully have you looked? |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=256) |  If you look microscopically, you might start to notice, oh yeah, well, it's changing, but |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=263) |  it's trivially changing. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=265) |  So what? |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=266) |  But then as you pay more and more attention to that, it's like, oh, well, actually, come |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=269) |  to think of it. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=271) |  And then that theme of flow and vanishing starts to dominate awareness. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=276) |  I have noticed, actually, I've noticed change. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=279) |  It is constantly changing. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=282) |  That's the physical discomfort? |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=283) |  The physical discomfort, yeah. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=285) |  Is it possible to describe the type of change? |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=289) |  By that I mean, my general word for continuous change is flow. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=294) |  And then if something disappears, I say it's gone or has vanished. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=298) |  Some of the flavors of flow that people experience are sort of like a waviness. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=304) |  Some people get like a bubbly vibration kind of thing. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=308) |  Some people get a sort of expansion or contraction or sort of both at the same time, like something |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=316) |  sort of like pushing out and pulling in at the same time. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=320) |  Is it possible to characterize the flavor of flow experience inside the itchiness? |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=326) |  It's like there's needles sticking in my arm, like millions of them, all at different times |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=333) |  and all in different places, but roughly in the same area. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=337) |  But just instantaneous little pricks of a needle. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=341) |  And so it's kind of like little bubbles, almost sounds pleasant. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=346) |  It's not pleasant because it's pricks, but it's like that in the sense of little pops. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=355) |  Yes. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=358) |  That's a strategy that we might take. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=361) |  We might choose to focus on change based on what you're reporting. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=365) |  Do you understand the three basic strategies? |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=368) |  Turn towards, turn away, or focus on change? |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=372) |  Those three sort of basic options. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=374) |  Now if we choose to turn away from the discomfort, we could either focus on restful states like |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=380) |  relaxation, physical relaxation or mental blank, mental quiet, that kind of stuff. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=386) |  That would be one turn away strategy. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=389) |  A second turn away strategy would be to focus on positive thoughts or positive emotions, |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=396) |  like sort of hold a positive image or positive feel in the body or have some sort of positive |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=403) |  talk in your head. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=404) |  So we could focus away from what you're doing, the uncomfortable touch, on either pleasant |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=412) |  feel-image-talk states, or we could focus on restful states. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=417) |  So that would be a focus away. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=418) |  If we did a turn towards, we would pay attention to the touch itself, but we might also look |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=429) |  for feel-image-talk reactions that might be subtly present. |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=433) |  And if we do a focus on change, we're going to explore ways that your sensory experience |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=439) |  is constantly changing, not only the sensory challenge, but like other places. |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=444) |  Because when one part of the sensory system starts to flow, other parts will often flow. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=450) |  So even if your pain is solid, if we find flow in some other part of your sensory experience, |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=459) |  on that sometimes it spreads and breaks up the solidity in the painful areas. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=464) |  These strategies all make sense and the sort of techniques that we would use for each one |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=470) |  are clear to you? |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=471) |  Yes. |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=472) |  That's good. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=473) |  Now, as you can see, they all sort of work, but you may have a curiosity or a preference |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=479) |  as to where you'd like to start. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=482) |  If we do turn towards, we can either work just with the touch of the pain itself, or |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=489) |  we can work just with your feel-image-talk reactions to it. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=492) |  Those would be the two turn towards strategies. |
    | [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=495) |  The two turn away strategies would be focus on pleasant restful states or actively create |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=501) |  positive thoughts and feeling. |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=505) |  And then the focus on change will be we'll find change wherever we find it, emphasize |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=512) |  that and then see how widely that spreads. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=515) |  Does one of these particularly appeal to you? |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=519) |  I think the focus on change. |
    | [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=521) |  Let's explore that then. |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=522) |  That could be very interesting. |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=524) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=525) |  Are you comfortably seated? |
    | [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=527) |  Yes. |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=528) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=529) |  So I'm just going to do my own practice as you do yours. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkI4S9IqrXI&t=534) |  So I'd like you to take a moment to lengthen your spine and let your whole body settle. |

=== "Text"
     I like to think of challenges as coming in two types. There are behavioral challenges like, you know, I'm procrastinating or I'm smoking cigarettes and I want to change the behavior. So I call those behavioral challenges. Then there are what I call sensory challenges, which are because of some condition, some sensory experiences arising in the body, in the mind, in sight, sound, and so forth. And that's an uncomfortable sensory experience. So it's a challenge in that sense. So in my general formulation, I would say you're experiencing a sensory challenge and that challenge is uncomfortable touch, defining touch as physical type body sensation. Essentially when a person has a sensory challenge, they have three broad categories of strategies that can be applied. You can either turn your attention towards the sensory challenge and bring concentration, clarity, and equanimity to it. That would be a sort of turn towards and you're sort of perfusing the sensory challenge with mindful awareness. A second strategy could be called turn away, your concentration to focus elsewhere onto something that's pleasant. For example, you can focus on restful states or focus on the sound of music or positive emotions and so forth. And I call that a turning away strategy. A third strategy is that you can pay attention to how things change. And it's sort of not this too shall pass, but if you look carefully enough, this is passing moment by moment. And the passingness of it, both in terms of the sense that it's moving and flowing and in terms of the sense that each piece of it sort of falls away moment by moment, you can become so absorbed in the change that pretty soon you're just aware of change and you're not aware of it. I call that strategy focus on change. So you can turn towards or you can turn away or you can turn towards, you can focus on change. The tendency is to think, well, if I turn towards it, I'll just make it worse. So I don't want to do that. And then, well, if I turn away from it, I'm just avoiding and denying and suppressing. So I don't want to do that. And I know it's not going to change because it's rock solid. So what's the point of that? So then the person has set themselves up for failure. Although it is true that it may temporarily get worse if you turn towards it, if you really give it what it needs, in other words, experience it fully, because that's what mindful awareness is, is a full experience of something. If you experience it fully, it may get worse, but then it will break up. And then people say, well, if I turn away, I'm denying. But to turn away, you have to develop concentration, right? Because it takes a discipline to focus on something other than the sensory challenge. And you're not suppressing the sensory challenge. You're giving it permission to be there. You're just not intentionally focusing on it. So you are bringing equanimity to it, even though you're not paying attention to it. And you're also developing sensory clarity to learn how to detect a pleasant, restful state while you have a huge pain and emotion state. You're learning how to detect subtle, pleasant things that may always be there that you might not have noticed. The turn away strategy is valid. And as you're turning away, it may cause the thing to sort of cool out, the sensory challenge to cool out a bit. Then when you use those same skills that you've developed by turning away, you then can apply the concentration, clarity, equanimity, turn towards. The more cooled out version of it, it may be more penetratable. So the focus away is absolutely as legitimate as focus on. And as far as, well, I know nothing changes as solid as the rock. Well, how carefully have you looked? If you look microscopically, you might start to notice, oh yeah, well, it's changing, but it's trivially changing. So what? But then as you pay more and more attention to that, it's like, oh, well, actually, come to think of it. And then that theme of flow and vanishing starts to dominate awareness. I have noticed, actually, I've noticed change. It is constantly changing. That's the physical discomfort? The physical discomfort, yeah. Is it possible to describe the type of change? By that I mean, my general word for continuous change is flow. And then if something disappears, I say it's gone or has vanished. Some of the flavors of flow that people experience are sort of like a waviness. Some people get like a bubbly vibration kind of thing. Some people get a sort of expansion or contraction or sort of both at the same time, like something sort of like pushing out and pulling in at the same time. Is it possible to characterize the flavor of flow experience inside the itchiness? It's like there's needles sticking in my arm, like millions of them, all at different times and all in different places, but roughly in the same area. But just instantaneous little pricks of a needle. And so it's kind of like little bubbles, almost sounds pleasant. It's not pleasant because it's pricks, but it's like that in the sense of little pops. Yes. That's a strategy that we might take. We might choose to focus on change based on what you're reporting. Do you understand the three basic strategies? Turn towards, turn away, or focus on change? Those three sort of basic options. Now if we choose to turn away from the discomfort, we could either focus on restful states like relaxation, physical relaxation or mental blank, mental quiet, that kind of stuff. That would be one turn away strategy. A second turn away strategy would be to focus on positive thoughts or positive emotions, like sort of hold a positive image or positive feel in the body or have some sort of positive talk in your head. So we could focus away from what you're doing, the uncomfortable touch, on either pleasant feel-image-talk states, or we could focus on restful states. So that would be a focus away. If we did a turn towards, we would pay attention to the touch itself, but we might also look for feel-image-talk reactions that might be subtly present. And if we do a focus on change, we're going to explore ways that your sensory experience is constantly changing, not only the sensory challenge, but like other places. Because when one part of the sensory system starts to flow, other parts will often flow. So even if your pain is solid, if we find flow in some other part of your sensory experience, on that sometimes it spreads and breaks up the solidity in the painful areas. These strategies all make sense and the sort of techniques that we would use for each one are clear to you? Yes. That's good. Now, as you can see, they all sort of work, but you may have a curiosity or a preference as to where you'd like to start. If we do turn towards, we can either work just with the touch of the pain itself, or we can work just with your feel-image-talk reactions to it. Those would be the two turn towards strategies. The two turn away strategies would be focus on pleasant restful states or actively create positive thoughts and feeling. And then the focus on change will be we'll find change wherever we find it, emphasize that and then see how widely that spreads. Does one of these particularly appeal to you? I think the focus on change. Let's explore that then. That could be very interesting. Okay, good. Are you comfortably seated? Yes. Okay, good. So I'm just going to do my own practice as you do yours. So I'd like you to take a moment to lengthen your spine and let your whole body settle.
