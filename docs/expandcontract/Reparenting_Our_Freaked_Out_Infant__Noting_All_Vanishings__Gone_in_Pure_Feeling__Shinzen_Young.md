    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=0) |  What is the significance of Vanishing? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=5) |  I was focusing on vanishings, and the vanishings became ubiquitous, just like it's everywhere. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=15) |  But in the past, when I've noted vanishings, say with the breath, |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=21) |  it's actually been a sort of soothing experience with sort of an afterglow of peacefulness. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=29) |  I found this experience of noting vanishing to be highly agitating. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=34) |  I think the implied question is, what does that mean and what should I do? |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=39) |  Uncomfortably stimulating, agitating. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=43) |  Noting nothing whatsoever has resulted in a lot of uncomfortable something. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=52) |  How closely correlated would you say, and a certain amount of guessing may be involved on this, |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=59) |  how much correlation would you say there is between the fact that you were noting vanishing |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=67) |  and the fact that you're sort of hyped up? |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=70) |  In other words, does it seem highly correlated with that, that that really had something to do with it? |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=76) |  Or would it be more, well, the potential was there and I might be hyped up because of other things. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=86) |  I'd like you to make a guess. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=89) |  Is it because you said, well, I'm sort of excited about this prospect and that, |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=94) |  and I haven't had the sugar fix or the coffee fix, so it's not that, |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=98) |  but it might have been some other things you sort of intimated. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=102) |  Do you think that the noting of vanishing played a large role in this, |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=108) |  or other factors may have entered in? |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=113) |  The answer, not sure at all, is completely valid. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=118) |  There's a pretty strong correlation between the paying attention to nothing |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=125) |  and a lot of agitating something. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=129) |  That's good. That's what I wanted to determine. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=133) |  Or it may be uncomfortable, but it's good as far as practice goes. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=139) |  Is it mostly, well, you report a lot of talk, |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=142) |  but would you say that the agitation is primarily in feel, image, or talk? |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=148) |  It's primarily in feel. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=151) |  I don't want to put words in your mouth, so correct me if this is wrong, |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=156) |  but the gist that I'm getting is I was noting vanishings, |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=161) |  which usually is a peaceful experience for me, |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=165) |  and I usually note vanishings just in the breath, |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=169) |  the ends of the in and out breaths or external sounds, |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=173) |  but two things happened this time that are very different. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=178) |  First of all, the vanishing globalized to it's like everything's vanishing, |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=184) |  and secondly, it was agitating and specifically agitating |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=189) |  at the level of pure emotion in the body. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=193) |  Did I more or less nail it? |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=195) |  Okay. That's called precision. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=198) |  We have a vocabulary that allows for this kind of precision. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=202) |  Now that I've honed it down to that, I can give a pretty confident answer |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=207) |  with regards to the two implicit questions, |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=210) |  why is this happening and what should I do about it? |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=217) |  Why it's happening is because you really did the technique well. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=224) |  The vanishing points us to the most primordial, primitive experience |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=232) |  that a human being can have, which is a non-human experience, |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=238) |  and actually the ultimate grounding, groundless grounding. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=244) |  However, if it points us to the ultimately primordial or primitive experience |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=252) |  that any human being can have, so primitive that it's not human, |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=256) |  there must also be the second most primitive experience |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=261) |  that a human being can have, that's pretty close to it. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=267) |  That is definitely a human experience, |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=272) |  and that is the experience of primordial chaotic feel of the infant. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=280) |  You died a thousand little times, petit mort, little deaths, into the gons. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=291) |  When you came back, you came back as a little infant body with freak-out chaotic feel. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=300) |  That's really, really, really good. That's the good news. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=309) |  Why? Well, that in and of itself wouldn't be good news, |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=313) |  but that combined with the fact that you're an experienced meditator is very good news. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=318) |  Because then you just note feel and its vanishings. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=325) |  You'll be working through the first thing that separated you from your spiritual source, |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=332) |  the very first thing, in the first weeks and hours of life. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=338) |  You get to work at that level. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=342) |  All you have to do is note feel and its vanishing, |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=346) |  and all the other vanishings. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=350) |  See, right now you're an adult meditator. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=354) |  Then you were a helpless infant. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=358) |  Now you've got a super adult. You're better than an adult. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=361) |  The adult meditator will apply the technique of note vanishing |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=367) |  and include the feel vanishing in that technique. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=373) |  The adult meditator will therefore work through that primordial level of freak-out of the infant. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=382) |  That's the linchpin on the freak-out of the adult, |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=388) |  and of the teenager, and of all the intermediate levels from infant to adult. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=395) |  Sasaki Roshi says that the first thing that happens after zero breaks apart |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=403) |  is expansion and contraction pull in opposite directions, |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=408) |  and they cause a creation of a cleft of pure space. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=418) |  But because expansion is pulling out and contraction is pulling in, that space vibrates. |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=425) |  It vibrates into pure heat of feel. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=432) |  Jō netsu in Japanese. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=435) |  Jō means pure feeling, unalloyed with anything else, and netsu means heat. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=441) |  He says if you can detect that, that is the beginning of the self. |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=447) |  That's the primordium of self. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=450) |  The true primordium of self is the space, and the source of the space is spaceless. |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=458) |  But the first thing that is in some sense a self, and not impersonal, |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=464) |  is that pure heat of feel. |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=467) |  And if you can detect and complete it, |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=471) |  then the part of it that came from the expansion goes back to expansion. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=476) |  The part of it that came from contraction goes back to contraction. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=479) |  And the freaked out infant becomes its cosmic parents. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=485) |  And then zero is reestablished, the next gone. |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=490) |  And you are that. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=492) |  And you do that long enough, you will have completely reparented yourself. |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=497) |  And the adult that then will arise from that process will be called an enlightened human. |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=520) |  OK. |
    | [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=521) |  The comment was I was thinking of taking a nap. |
    | [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=525) |  But now maybe I should sit. |
    | [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=529) |  Either is fine. |
    | [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=532) |  Either is fine. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=534) |  There is a case for either one. |
    | [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=536) |  You need to take your ego death in manageable doses. |
    | [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=541) |  Don't worry, it will probably happen again. |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=544) |  Or maybe that's a do worry, I don't know. |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=547) |  But it took a long time, but that's the way I like to work. |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=553) |  To really find out what's going on, I don't like to shoot from the hip as far as answering people's questions. |
    | [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=561) |  But you see how we pinpointed exactly what was going on? |
    | [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=565) |  We had a precise vocabulary. |
    | [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=568) |  And I gave you what I would consider to be an optimal response strategy. |
    | [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg-h_MSijDo&t=575) |  And we are done. |

     What is the significance of Vanishing? I was focusing on vanishings, and the vanishings became ubiquitous, just like it's everywhere.
