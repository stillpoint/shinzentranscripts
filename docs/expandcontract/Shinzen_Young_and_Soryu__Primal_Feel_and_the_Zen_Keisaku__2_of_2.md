    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=0) |  What is the difference between a Zen and a Vipassana? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=5) |  Soryu has decided that he is sick of me perverting the true teachings of Zen by mixing it with Vipassana. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=18) |  And also my cavalier and arrogant attitude, claiming that there have never been any good meditation teachers, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=30) |  although there have been and are great ones, needs to be chastised in public. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=36) |  You didn't expect that, did you? |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=54) |  So we're going to show you how it's done. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=57) |  And he's good at it. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=59) |  And he's like a professional, I don't know if you know, but he's like arguably the best tennis player in Vermont. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=67) |  He's a professional athlete and he's young and he's strong. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=71) |  He might break it, okay? |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=74) |  Okay, so would you like to say anything? |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=81) |  Why don't you come up here and tell your Keisaku stories? |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=89) |  I actually went through a similar experience, so I don't have very much new to say. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=97) |  I went into the temple and for the first period of time the Keisaku actually seemed... |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=106) |  Maybe this isn't the same. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=108) |  It seemed kind of fun. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=109) |  I was young and felt very tough, and I was good at meditation and all this. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=120) |  And I liked it that I was in a tough place with people who'd hit me. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=124) |  And it was kind of fun. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=127) |  And there came a point, which I actually talked about earlier today, |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=135) |  when I started to notice how distracted I actually was, |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=141) |  which I'd never noticed because I was too distracted to notice. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=146) |  TSL, distracted from distraction by distraction. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=149) |  So I was distracted to the point that I sometimes believed that I'd be thinking I'm pretty good at this |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=160) |  and not noticing that I was distracted from my meditation when I was thinking how good I was at the meditation. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=168) |  And there came a very horrifying transformation when I noticed that I actually couldn't keep my concentration |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=178) |  in my estimation at that point for even one second. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=182) |  Couldn't keep my mind on anything for a second. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=185) |  And I started to have a great deal of insecurity. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=186) |  And it was really at that point when the keisaku turned into something horrifying. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=193) |  And then the person would carry the keisaku. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=197) |  At least for me, the self-talk was all negative about them. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=201) |  What's this terrible person doing trying to hurt us and wreck this monastery with violence and all of that? |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=209) |  And it was really quite a while before I managed to work through that. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=218) |  In a similar way, though, Harada Roshi actually began to regularly carry it. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=224) |  For a long sit, he would carry it very slowly through the zendo. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=230) |  And it was that presence that it really felt as he moved it. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=235) |  You mentioned that wave. It was like there was just a force of such energy penetrating, |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=245) |  just penetrating my body, penetrating. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=249) |  And it particularly would penetrate my legs, which were in extreme pain. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=253) |  Early on, I decided I would only sit in full lotus. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=256) |  I don't know why I decided that, but I decided to only sit in full lotus. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=261) |  And that meant that I was in extreme pain pretty much all the time. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=268) |  Definitely the most pain I've ever experienced. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=272) |  And as you would walk, this sphere, it's like a sun. It's like a comet. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=283) |  It's just like this amazing force of power would move and would start to penetrate my body. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=294) |  And there was so much resistance to the pain and to the keisaku coming |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=300) |  that I would resist that power, which made it hurt so much more. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=305) |  And it wasn't until I really just freaked out one time as he was about to hit me. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=310) |  It wasn't until that happened. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=311) |  And I was shaking, you understand, just shaking and trying to bow like this. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=318) |  It was just unbelievably terrible. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=323) |  It wasn't until there was a point there when it's just too much |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=329) |  and it's just easier to not do that anymore. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=333) |  Just easier, not better, not, oh good, I've got a great idea. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=338) |  I'll stop resisting. Not like that. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=339) |  It was just, I just can't anymore. Just no. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=344) |  And so at the moment it penetrates finally. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=351) |  Sometimes I say it's sort of like going to the bathroom when you really have to. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=358) |  You finally just let yourself, you can finally go to the bathroom. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=362) |  And it felt kind of like that, but just coming in and flowing through. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=366) |  And then it's uplifting. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=374) |  It's just uplifting. You feel kind of like you're floating. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=379) |  So I actually came back also to the US and I was using it. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=383) |  I actually haven't really used the Keisaku that much here. |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=387) |  And I don't think it's a good idea to make it seem as if |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=393) |  this is sort of like war stories or like this is a heroic device or something. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=399) |  It's not. It's just a tool. |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=402) |  I don't think that a system that uses it has everything going right. |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=408) |  To not use it is just great. |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=411) |  But today we'll show you how it's done. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=414) |  Sorry. Well, I have to deserve it, right? |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=432) |  Okay. Game face. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=462) |  Okay. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=487) |  Okay. |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=517) |  Oh, yeah. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=534) |  So now you know. |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=537) |  Thanks, Aria. |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=539) |  So I'm sorry. |
    | [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=548) |  It's a little giddy. |
    | [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=551) |  It's just good. |
    | [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=561) |  You know what's going to happen. |
    | [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99h8CpIK8pQ&t=563) |  All right. |
