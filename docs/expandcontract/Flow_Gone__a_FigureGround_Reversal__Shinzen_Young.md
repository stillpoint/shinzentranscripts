    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=0) |  Let's say that you decide, okay, you're going to just note flow. |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=9) |  At first, you'll probably be aware of where the flow is, what's flowing, and so forth. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=14) |  But you may reach a point where you actually don't care and don't even know whether it's |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=23) |  somatic, visual, or auditory. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=27) |  Those discriminations break down. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=29) |  Subjective versus objective breaks down. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=31) |  Ordinary versus restful breaks down. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=33) |  All you're interested in is just flow. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=37) |  You actually begin to lose specificity with regards to all the distinctions that we make |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=44) |  in the other techniques. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=46) |  That's highly desirable. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=47) |  You can't make that happen. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=49) |  But there's really, you know how I always say it's a dialectical process. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=55) |  Half of the dialectic is making these discriminations in a healthy way. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=60) |  The other half is destroying the discriminations also in a healthy way. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=71) |  Flow is lecom platisil. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=74) |  It's the great leveler that destroys distinctions. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=77) |  The only greater leveler is gone. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=81) |  That destroys time and space. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=85) |  Can't have distinctions without time and space. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=88) |  You can still distinguish flavors of flow. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=91) |  Vibratory, undulatory. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=93) |  There's no different flavors of God. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=96) |  If you reach a point where you're noting flow and it's like sort of what I was describing. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=104) |  It's like all flow and you don't even know what it is or where it is or who you are or |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=108) |  where you are, that now you're getting close to that figure ground reversal that I talked |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=114) |  about last night. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=116) |  And good, go with that. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=118) |  Same deal with the gone. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=121) |  You can reach a point where you don't know what it is that's disappearing. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=124) |  You don't even know whether it was big or small. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=126) |  Pleasant, unpleasant, simple, complex. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=129) |  You forget about all that. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=131) |  You're just dominated by the vanishingness of things. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=137) |  And that once again leads to the figure ground reversal piece. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=142) |  That was what you were starting to experience. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=145) |  And if you get the combined where it's flow, go, flow, go, flow, go, that's all you're |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=149) |  with, then that's going to lead to that experience of there's |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=162) |  this matrix of nothingness that is birthing self and scene moment by moment inside that |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=173) |  rhythm of flow and go, flow and go. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=176) |  When there's go, there's nothing. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=180) |  And then it breaks apart and it sort of scintillates and that scintillating mist, if it gets coagulated, |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=189) |  we call it a self in a world. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=192) |  If it doesn't get coagulated, we call it pure spirit. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=196) |  And part of it is constantly spreading out effortlessly. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=202) |  Part of it is constantly pulling in effortlessly. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=204) |  It's a fountain of youth, invisible doing. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=211) |  So that would be the flow gone, flow gone. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=214) |  You combine the two together. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKm-WXRH2IQ&t=217) |  That's an option for focus on change. |
