    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=0) |  Each one of the five ways goes back to at least one, if not many, historical traditions |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=17) |  that were developed around the world, and not exclusively in the East from Buddhism, |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=22) |  but they also link to traditions from other parts of the world, the West, Christianity |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=29) |  and so forth. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=31) |  Because as I say, I tend to see the worldwide contemplative tradition as a unity. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=36) |  You could look back from the five ways and you could see the whole history of the development |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=42) |  of contemplation from its shamanic origins through the arising of civilizations and through |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=51) |  the seminal discoveries of the Buddha particularly, and then the Mahayana sort of merging with |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=60) |  Zen and what came out of that, and then the Vajrayana, and then the sort of more non-dual |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=66) |  approaches. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=67) |  All of that is behind it. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=70) |  And I could go into a long talk and have elsewhere as to the rich historical origins of each |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=79) |  of the five ways. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=81) |  They have a past, but they also have, I believe, a future because they represent reworkings |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=90) |  of those traditions. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=91) |  I don't claim that these are those traditions. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=94) |  I am attempting to make, represent a secular modern approach to these things. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=106) |  The spiritual clout I don't want to lose, the liberating clout that each one of them |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=112) |  can lead to classical enlightenment, can lead to what I believe is the core spiritual experience |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=120) |  of humanity. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=122) |  Certainly don't want to lose that. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=124) |  Cultural trappings, doctrinal trappings, things that are based on mythology or things that |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=135) |  don't seem to have an empirical basis or don't seem probable logically, I have tried to take |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=145) |  that out, for better or worse. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=148) |  It's an approach that will work for certain people and not work for other people, like |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=153) |  all approaches. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=155) |  Every approach has strengths and weaknesses, and that's good because different things work |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=161) |  for different people. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=162) |  This is one direction that a person could take if they wanted to explore what can be |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=168) |  done creatively with what has come down to us from the past. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=173) |  Just one possible way to go. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=178) |  If you look carefully at the five way system, you'll notice it's all built on binary contrasts. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=186) |  Binary means one-on-one, one-on-one contrast, like black versus white, that's a binary contrast. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=196) |  That's intentional because when you study, when you do functional imaging of brain changes |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=208) |  as the result of whatever, meditation or anything else, you can't actually image the brain function. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=219) |  You can just have two contrasting conditions and compare them. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=224) |  I designed the system to work that way. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=227) |  There's a contrast between tracking ordinary sensory activity and tracking corresponding |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=234) |  restful states. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=236) |  There's a contrast between intentionally creating positive feel-image talk and just observing |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=243) |  any and all feel-image talk. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=246) |  There's a contrast between working with the subjective somatic visual and auditory experience |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=253) |  versus objective somatic visual and auditory experience. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=258) |  There's a contrast between relative rest, where you're focusing on restful qualities, |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=266) |  and absolute rest, where you do nothing, etc., etc., etc. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=271) |  Any one of those presents itself as a natural thing that can be studied with the imaging |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=281) |  technology. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=283) |  When I say that the five ways have a future, hopefully, by that I mean they've been set |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=288) |  up based on what I know that scientists need when they do this kind of research so that |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62wZtKuWHS4&t=297) |  their effects can be easily researched in subsequent generations. |
