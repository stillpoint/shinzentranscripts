    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=0) |  I usually don't talk about reality. I prefer to talk about sensory experience. Sensory |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=11) |  experience is something I have a lot of confidence with. When I make statements about sensory |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=18) |  experience, it's based on years and years of my own investigations, working with my |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=25) |  own sensory experience, other people's sensory experience. So, as I say, I have a lot of |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=32) |  confidence in that. I don't speak about the underlying reality that's behind sensory experience, |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=41) |  or even if there is a reality behind sensory experience, or what is it? People will often |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=47) |  ask, well, what do we really see? What do we really hear? The reason I don't talk about |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=54) |  it is that I don't have confidence that I have good answers about it. I have my own |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=62) |  conjectures, but they're just that. When it comes to sensory experience, I know I can |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=69) |  teach people things that are true, deep, useful, and broad. Now, in general, things that are |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=76) |  true, deep, useful, and broad are considered good science. So I think I can give good science |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=84) |  for sensory experience. In terms of what's behind sensory experience, or what's really |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=92) |  out there, I notice that very intelligent people seem to be arguing about this for a |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=99) |  very, very long time. Intelligent people that have given a lot of thought and research to |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=107) |  the question of what is objective external reality, that is to say, scientists and philosophers, |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=115) |  people who specialize in this field, do not seem to be able to agree and have not been |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=122) |  able to agree for a very, very long time. That indicates to me that although someday |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=130) |  the question probably will be answered in a satisfactory way for humanity, at this point |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=137) |  in human history, it's still contentious and conjectural, and therefore not something that |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=144) |  I, as an amateur, would want to make any statements about. So I limit myself to what I know for |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=152) |  sure. I know for sure that our sense of perceiving self arises through feel-image-talk reactions |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=163) |  to touch-sight sound. I know for sure that sensory experience is a very, very important |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=170) |  process to touch-sight sound. I know for sure that suffering equals pain multiplied by resistance, |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=178) |  et cetera, et cetera. For me, these awarenesses of sensory experience are enormously liberating. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=192) |  I know for sure that when you bring enough concentration, clarity, and equanimity to |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=197) |  any ordinary sensory experience, that ordinary sensory experience becomes so utterly extraordinary |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=204) |  that it could be named spiritual. To me, this is important stuff, and I have absolute confidence |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=212) |  in it. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=215) |  If you ask me, well, what's the object of reality reflected in touch-sight sound, feel-image-talk, |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=222) |  the sensory experiences we have? I say, I don't know. Could I make a wild conjecture? |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=231) |  Sure, but it would be a wild conjecture, not something that I would speak with a lot of |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=237) |  confidence and certainly not something that I would try to convince any other human being |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=242) |  of. If I were to make a wild conjecture as to what's really out there, I would guess |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=249) |  that every touch-sight, sound, feel-image-talk experience that we have is actually an experience |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=258) |  of everything, everything altogether in a way that the human brain is not conditioned, |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=265) |  evolved to perceive. We can't imagine what everything at once is, the whole causal nexus, |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=283) |  the suchness. Our brains aren't designed to process that. That would be my guess, for |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNHTDE1iYg&t=290) |  what it's worth. |
