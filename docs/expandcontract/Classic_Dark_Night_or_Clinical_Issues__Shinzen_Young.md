    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=0) |  If a person seems to be perennially in Dark Knight territory, I will first sort of ask |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=19) |  them questions. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=20) |  I do my own little differential diagnosis and try to determine if what they're going |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=26) |  through is 100% an artifact of the experience of emptiness through their practice, or whether |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=40) |  it's possible that there's just an element of regular old-fashioned depression, anxiety |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=48) |  that's involved. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=49) |  I'll try to make a guess. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=54) |  If I suspect that it's 100% based on practice, then I'll give my standard treatment regimen |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=66) |  for that, which is twofold. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=69) |  If the fact that everything is empty is freaking you out, well, clearly there's something that's |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=72) |  not yet empty, which is your freak-out. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=76) |  Use the momentum of emptiness to empty your freak-out. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=81) |  That's sort of the first element in the prescription. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=89) |  The second element in the prescription is, well, good. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=94) |  Now you're nothing whatsoever, and this will give us a natural basis from which you can |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=102) |  literally reconstruct a new and better self through focus on positive practice. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=109) |  I look upon myself in that case as something like a physical therapist that's going to |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=115) |  have to constantly be prodding that person to do the exercise that strengthens their |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=123) |  atrophied human muscles, so to speak. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=128) |  We rebuild those muscles in a new and better way through a focus, assiduous and continuous |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=137) |  focus on positive-feel image talk. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=141) |  That's what I do if I suspect that it's really the classic dark night of the soul or the |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=147) |  classic pit of the void that is described on one hand in the Christian and on the other |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=156) |  hand in the Buddhist traditions. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=159) |  However, usually that is not the case. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=165) |  Usually if a person is bummed out, burned out, freaking out, and so forth, they're subject |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=172) |  to unreasonable anxiety and unreasonable paralytic sadness and so forth, usually that is actually |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=185) |  the result of psychological elements. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=192) |  What I do is I never tell people that they should use psychotropic medications or anything |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=200) |  like that. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=201) |  Often people will come to me with that question, you know, should I go on Celexa or Lexapro |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=209) |  or what have you. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=210) |  I never tell people, oh, yeah, I think you should do that because I'm not qualified |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=216) |  to tell a person that. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=218) |  But if I suspect that they may have a clinical depression or an anxiety disorder of some |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=227) |  sort, in other words, if I suspect that it's not 100 percent based on their practice, and |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=234) |  usually that is the case. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=238) |  Usually I suspect that there could be just a plain old psychological, even clinical, |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=246) |  biochemical aspect here. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=249) |  If I suspect that that is possible, I strongly encourage people to go to a mental health |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=256) |  professional and consider the possibility of standard treatments for these things, which |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=266) |  at this point is usually medications. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=268) |  I don't advocate the medications, but I definitely advocate being open to the possibility that |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=276) |  they may need them and encourage them to find a competent expert who can give them a differential |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=283) |  diagnosis based on Western medicine and if need be, prescribe the meds. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=289) |  Now, a lot of times people think, oh, well, I shouldn't take these medications because |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=295) |  it covers over the stuff. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=297) |  I should just let it come up and deal with it. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=300) |  Well, yeah, if you can productively deal with it, sure. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=305) |  But remember, the metaphor is exercise. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=310) |  It doesn't make any sense to attempt to bench press 200 pounds the first day in the gym. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=316) |  You want to take manageable weights. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=319) |  If you have a clinical depression situation, that is probably too much weight to try to |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=329) |  be lifting on your own without some reduction in intensity through appropriate medication. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=342) |  And anything that needs to come up will come up. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=346) |  I tell people that if you do have a clinical situation, you're already in an unnatural |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=352) |  state. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=353) |  The meds will get you in some way closer to a natural state wherein it will be easier |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=359) |  to do the meditative practice. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=362) |  Now it's true that psychotropic medications can have side effects. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=368) |  A person has to decide whether those side effects are worth the main effect. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=375) |  That's case by case, person by person. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=378) |  But if they decide that the good effect is sufficient to justify the side effects, then |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=384) |  I would say this. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=386) |  Those side effects only come up in touch, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=393) |  You can use the mindfulness practice very productively to work with those side effects |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=403) |  to purify consciousness, to gain insight, to reduce the suffering that they cause, and |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ5B70ac_9M&t=409) |  so forth. |
