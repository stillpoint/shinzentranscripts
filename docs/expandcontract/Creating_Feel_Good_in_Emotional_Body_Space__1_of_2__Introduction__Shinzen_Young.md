    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=0) |  How did you discover positive feeling? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=5) |  We started with having you explore just the spontaneous presence of positive feel in your body, |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=13) |  which you did, and actually you were able to do that to a certain extent. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=17) |  But then it went away and it didn't come back, which is not uncommon. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=23) |  Finding positive feel is only one way to go about the technique of working with positive feel. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=34) |  Another thing that you can do is you can intentionally create positive feel and then focus on it. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=43) |  One of the easiest ways to create positive feel is to briefly, intentionally make a positive thought |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=52) |  that's likely to make you happy or loving or joyous and so forth. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=57) |  Thought is something you have control over. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=60) |  Thought is your mental image and your internal talk or both at the same time. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=64) |  So you briefly think a thought that's likely to give you a pleasant feel, |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=72) |  and it could be anything of your choice. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=75) |  Then you sort of drop that and you tune into how that pleasant feel may continue to resonate in your body |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=84) |  even after you've dropped the thought. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=87) |  Then you focus in on it, the same way we focused in on the pleasant feel that was just there spontaneously. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=93) |  But in this case, if the sort of resonance of positive feel goes away, |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=100) |  then you think the same thought or a different thought just briefly, |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=105) |  just enough to get the body vibrating again with a momentum of pleasant feel. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=113) |  I call that triggering the positive feel by a brief intentional thought. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=119) |  Does that make sense as a concept? |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=121) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=122) |  You may have to make the intentional thought frequently, |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=125) |  or it may be that your body is emotionally very resonant. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=130) |  So just like you think a positive thought and maybe for 30 seconds or 3 minutes, |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=137) |  your body continues to resonate, and now you're focusing in on it with concentration and so forth. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=144) |  The metaphor that I use for that is if we imagine that your emotional body is a bell. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=153) |  This is your emotional body bell, and it's sort of passive. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=157) |  It just responds, and this is your thought, which you have control over. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=165) |  If you briefly think a positive thought, that's going to resonate. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=172) |  That's like striking the emotional body bell. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=175) |  Then you can tune into the resonance for as long as it may last, then strike again if need be. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=181) |  We're going to do it for the fun of it with external sound. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=186) |  I'm going to strike it, and then I'd like you to listen to it until it's completely— |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=190) |  there's no more resonance anymore. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=193) |  I'll do the same. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=214) |  Gone. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=217) |  But we could strike it again as need be. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=220) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=222) |  Very good. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=224) |  We'll call that triggering positive feel. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=228) |  But our focus isn't the thought. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=230) |  Our focus is still pure body. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=233) |  We're training your emotional circuits to strengthen the positive emotional muscles, so to speak. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=243) |  It's like physical therapy. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=245) |  A lot of people, if they don't exercise muscles, they atrophy, and then you have to give them physical therapy, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=254) |  and then those muscles get strong. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=257) |  There's sort of like positive emotional circuitry within our brain, but if we don't exercise it, it might atrophy. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=267) |  People that are depressed, for example, or whatever. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=270) |  This exercise that I'm showing you is a sort of emotional physiotherapy. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=277) |  It strengthens the atrophied circuits and gives you a tendency—it imparts to your body a tendency to go to positive emotional experience as opposed to negative. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=292) |  So should I be trying to aim it at different parts of my body? |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=297) |  As a general principle, when you detect the pleasant feel with this technique, you try to intentionally spread your attention as broadly as you can within it. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=310) |  In fact, if possible, you try to experience it over your whole body. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=315) |  If possible, but you can't force that. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=318) |  So however wide it may be present in your body—right, left, front, back, up, down—you sort of stretch your attention over it. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=326) |  If it gets really strong, which it will with practice, it will fill your whole body. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=333) |  Then when it gets really strong, it will seem to be larger than your body, like it's radiating out into all six directions. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=341) |  You're sort of like this high-wattage transmitter. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=349) |  Then you start walking through the world like that, and that has an influence. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=356) |  That's an advanced level of the practice. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=359) |  Make sense? At least conceptually. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=362) |  Sounds like a pretty good idea, right? |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abRaPYjb6mA&t=364) |  Yeah. |
