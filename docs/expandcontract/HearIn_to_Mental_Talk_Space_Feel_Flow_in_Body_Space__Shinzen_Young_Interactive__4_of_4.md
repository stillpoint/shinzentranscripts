    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=0) |  Did there continue to be flow in image space? |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=19) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=20) |  As you focused on it, did it have any soothing qualities or not particularly? |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=26) |  It was more neutral, I think. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=29) |  Okay, not particularly soothing. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=31) |  But you could detect the movement there. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=34) |  Mm-hmm. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=35) |  Now I'd like you to move your attention back into your head where you might hear internal conversations, |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=42) |  which we'll call talk space. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=45) |  And are things pretty quiet right now, or is there chatter present? |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=51) |  A little. There's a little chatter, but it's pretty quiet. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=56) |  Sometimes when things are quiet in talk space, there can be a sense of a kind of undercurrent of energy, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=63) |  a kind of rumbling or whispering deep down below the conscious talk. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=72) |  You've experienced that in the past. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=74) |  You know what I'm talking about. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=76) |  I'd like you to scope out and see if anything like that is present right now. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=82) |  It may or may not be. If it's not there, that's fine. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=86) |  It's not like an assignment to find it. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=89) |  But we're going to just see if there's any of that subtle vibratory flow, that pre-conscious talk thing. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=109) |  Anything like that at this time, or are things just pretty still and quiet? |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=114) |  I had some. Then I had a tune visit me for a while, and then there was some talk. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=122) |  Explicit talk. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=123) |  So there's not a lot of that vibratory, subtle flow at this time. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=127) |  No. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=127) |  Is that correct? |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=128) |  That's right. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=129) |  Okay, fine. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=130) |  Bring your attention back to the body, and see if the flow is still there with regards to the body. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=141) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=142) |  Good. Excellent. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=145) |  So, any questions about what we did so far? |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=149) |  No. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=150) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=151) |  Now we're going to go through the same exercise, see if you can keep contact with the flow with your eyes open. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=177) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=178) |  Excellent. Now we're going to go to the next challenge level. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=183) |  See if you can keep contact with the flow and make eye contact with me. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=189) |  So it's more like an ordinary type situation. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=193) |  That's a lot. Yeah, you can do it. Excellent. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=196) |  So, this is pretty cool, huh? |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=203) |  Any final questions or comments? |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=207) |  No. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=209) |  Any time in your life in the future, if you have physical discomfort, you can remember that you can do things like this. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=216) |  And what I was doing is, I was doing exploratory work. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=220) |  I was like asking you questions, seeing what was going on, and then based on that I would like change the guidance and suggest certain things. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=231) |  First we checked out some local flow and then we found that it tended to spread through your body. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=238) |  So I was looking. I know that that's a tendency. It doesn't always happen. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=242) |  But if it does happen, it's significant because then the person can get this sort of whole body massage thing. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=248) |  Then I took a look to see if there was any fluidity in your mental experience. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=255) |  At this time there wasn't any. There wasn't any significance and there doesn't need to be. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=261) |  But sometimes a mind space will also flow. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=265) |  If that had been the case, I would have had you broaden your focus to zoom out and cover the whole mind and body as a single flow field. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=277) |  But that wasn't the case and we didn't need to do that. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=280) |  Are you still experiencing it now in the body? |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=283) |  You've got your money's worth, right? |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=286) |  The huge smile indicates the taste of purification and freedom from suffering. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=295) |  That's excellent work. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=297) |  So that's how it goes. Any final questions or comments? |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=302) |  No. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=303) |  Okay. Well, we're done. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVzuhfc1wF4&t=304) |  Thank you. |
