    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=0) |  Yes, a stone axe is in some sense more primitive than a steel axe. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=13) |  So I guess the assumption among the Europeans when they came to the Americas was, well, |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=22) |  their axes are more primitive than ours, therefore their consciousness must be more primitive |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=27) |  than ours. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=29) |  And once you've participated in their ceremony, you don't know whether to laugh or cry at |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=35) |  that notion, because it is so deep and so subtle. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=40) |  On the surface, it's a prayer ceremony. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=44) |  It's also a physical cleansing. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=47) |  It's also a shared group's sort of group therapy, because people talk and their defenses are |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=56) |  down. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=58) |  It is a shamanic journey into the power realms, because of the altered states that you may |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=65) |  enter. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=67) |  At a deeper level, it is purification of consciousness through having equanimity with strong sensations, |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=76) |  both physical and emotional sensations come up. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=80) |  And within the context of the ceremony, the ceremony induces a mindful state, and therefore |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=89) |  consciousness is purified. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=91) |  Purification equals sensation multiplied by equanimity fits in my model perfectly. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=97) |  So that's at a very deep level. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=100) |  And at the deepest level, it's an experience of the flow of nature in terms of the fundamental |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=110) |  forces of expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=113) |  They may use different words. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=114) |  They use father sky, mother earth, or they talk about the bowl of the pipe versus the |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=124) |  stem of the pipe, the earth versus the tree. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=129) |  But everything is built on an interplay of a flow of affirmation and negation. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=138) |  I've even heard native people talk about yin and yang, actually use those words in the |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=145) |  ceremonies because of their education, that they've learned of concepts from East Asia |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=152) |  and so forth and see how they map on. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=155) |  In fact, the word inipi in the Lakota language, I said it means a tool for life, but the stem |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=162) |  ni in Lakota, Lakota, if you're not familiar with the term, is the Western Sioux. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=170) |  Ni means life, but it also means breath, and it also means the sort of flowing energy of |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=181) |  spirit that would be vibrating, expanding, contracting, and so forth. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=188) |  So the whole ceremony is built around merging with the fundamental flow of the expansive |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=197) |  sky and the contractive earth and the vibrating energy that's born in between them. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=206) |  So it's the essence of mindfulness practice as I understand it. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=213) |  And on top of that, it's fun. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=218) |  It's colorful. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=220) |  It's shared with a group. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=222) |  Buddhist practice is sort of, well, I mean, there's the subtle sharing that happens on |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=227) |  a silent retreat, but it's sort of like silent, you're with yourself. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=231) |  This is not a subtle sharing. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=233) |  You're singing. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=234) |  You're like really singing, okay? |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=237) |  And people are crying and people are saying things because their defenses are down, and |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=243) |  then everybody is affirming them. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=245) |  They're saying, that's good. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=246) |  Yeah, that brother, good. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=249) |  It's like this shared support structure that you have. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=255) |  It's very communal. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=257) |  So it makes the perfect complement to the Buddhist practice. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=261) |  The Buddhist practice gives you systematic techniques for doing things. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=266) |  They don't have those systematic techniques because they don't need those systematic techniques. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=271) |  They just do these ceremonies. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=272) |  They don't have the concepts of purification equals plain plus equanimity, multiplied by |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=281) |  clarity, et cetera. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=283) |  They just do the ceremonies, okay? |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=285) |  They don't need the terminology. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=288) |  They don't have to have a philosophical system about the fundamental oneness of things. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=295) |  They just say, all my relations, okay? |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=299) |  And that sums it all up, okay? |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=301) |  We're all related. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=303) |  It's like, oh, so this is what they mean by primitive religion, okay? |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=306) |  In other words, this so-called primitive religion is really subtle, multi-layered, goes down |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=313) |  to the deepest, from the most surface to the deepest in a single integrated ceremony. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=321) |  It's like so impressive as a spiritual vehicle. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=326) |  So I knew this is for me. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=329) |  It was 27 years ago, and it's been true. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=332) |  I've been doing these ceremonies with native people wherever I can, wherever I run a retreat, |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=340) |  when there is someone that can do it in the traditional way, I make it available for our |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=348) |  retreatants. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=349) |  My metaphor is that for me, the Buddhist practice will always be the cake, sort of the substance, |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=357) |  but I like a little frosting on my cake. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=359) |  And the Native American ceremonies in general, specifically the sweat lodge, represents that |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by7veja2WHc&t=368) |  frosting on the cake for me. |
