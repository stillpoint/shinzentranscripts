    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=0) |  What is the difference between eating and not eating? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=7) |  When a person who is a compulsive eater |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=13) |  overcomes their eating compulsion, |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=17) |  they don't stop eating. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=20) |  They continue to eat, but they eat in a different way. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=24) |  It's not driven, and it's healthier. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=32) |  With regards to our mind, |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=37) |  the mind has a certain drive to find meaning. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=45) |  That drive, I think, is in some way intrinsic to the image-talk circuits themselves, |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=52) |  but also is linked to feel. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=57) |  I define feel as emotional body sensation. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=63) |  When the mind finds meaning, |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=67) |  you'll find a smile on your face, |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=70) |  or a rosiness in your chest, or a frisson, |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=74) |  a kind of ripple of pleasant excitement through your body. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=79) |  When the mind fails to find meaning, |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=84) |  when the mind is confused, muddled, spinning to no avail, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=90) |  then you'll find in the body sensations of fear and tear, |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=98) |  and impatience, agitation, and so forth. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=103) |  So, the drive to find meaning involves, I believe, |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=110) |  a certain intrinsic drive in the image-talk circuits |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=115) |  to establish pattern, |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=120) |  and then some juice in the body, |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=123) |  particularly with regards to the pleasure associated with finding answers |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=129) |  and the discomfort in the body associated with being confused or not having answers, |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=137) |  especially fear and sadness flavors. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=143) |  So, some combination of forces within feel-image-talk drive us to have meaning. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=151) |  We can train ourselves into equanimity with don't-know. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=156) |  It's a systematic training. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=159) |  The medieval Christians called it docta ignorantia, or trained ignorance. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=167) |  The ancient Greeks called it epokhe, |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=172) |  in their pronunciation, meaning to suspend. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=176) |  Suspend what? Suspend the need to have answers. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=179) |  In Zen, it's called don't-know mind. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=182) |  This can be systematically trained, |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=186) |  meaning that one can systematically work through the forces in image-talk and feel |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=194) |  that drive us to have meaning. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=197) |  Now, why is it important to do that? |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=202) |  Well, I would say several reasons. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=204) |  For one thing, inevitably, we will be faced with the inability to find meaning. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=214) |  Every new thing we know raises new questions. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=218) |  So, our don't-know grows faster than our do-know. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=223) |  By our, I mean the human species. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=225) |  So, we have to accept the fact that we'll always be facing don't-know. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=234) |  And in fact, a major theme in modern mathematics and modern physics |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=241) |  is the limits of what even can be known, or at least known in certain ways. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=247) |  Gödel's undecidability and incompleteness theorems, |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=255) |  Heisenberg uncertainty in physics and so forth, |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=262) |  point us directly to don't-know. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=265) |  In fact, a point could be made that the stability of the known universe, |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=272) |  in that it depends on Heisenberg uncertainty, |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=275) |  depends on God's equanimity with don't-know. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=280) |  Anyway, so sooner or later, we and probably God, |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=285) |  are faced with don't-know. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=288) |  I'm being somewhat metaphorical and humorous, I think you understand, |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=293) |  on the theoretical level. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=295) |  And then on the practical level, hey, we're going to get old. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=298) |  And as we get old, our mental faculties deteriorate. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=301) |  I can see for myself I'm 65, and I can see it's downhill. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=308) |  I'm past my intellectual peak. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=312) |  But that doesn't freak me out, |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=315) |  because I have made friends with don't-know. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=320) |  I've made friends with my own impending stupidity. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=324) |  There was a famous 20th century mathematician that I like a lot. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=328) |  He was quite eccentric, named Paul Erdos. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=333) |  E-R-D-O-S is how you write that name. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=337) |  And he wanted to have put on his gravestone. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=340) |  I don't know if they actually did it, but what he said, |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=343) |  put on my gravestone is, |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=345) |  at last I'm not getting stupider anymore. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=349) |  So I can see I'm sort of getting, gradually getting stupider. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=353) |  But that's okay. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=354) |  So theoretically and practically, sooner or later, we have to face don't-know. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=360) |  There is a need to deal with the need to know. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=364) |  And fortunately, there is a way of doing that. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=367) |  The other reason why it's good to be able to deal with don't-know |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=375) |  is that, as you'll remember on the metaphor of the compulsive eater, |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=380) |  when the compulsive eater has worked through their compulsion to eat, |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=387) |  they don't stop eating. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=389) |  In fact, they eat in a much more fulfilling new way. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=394) |  When a human being works through the need to have answers, |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=399) |  they don't stop having answers. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=401) |  They start having answers in a deeply fulfilling and radical new way. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=407) |  That's why the Christians in the Middle Ages and the Greeks in classical antiquity, |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=414) |  at least some of them, cultivated this. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=416) |  And it's the basis also for the Zen koan practices, |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=421) |  like what's the sound of one hand and so forth. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=424) |  This new way of knowing, we have a name for it. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=429) |  We call it wisdom function. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=431) |  So both because we don't want to suffer due to the fact that don't-know is inevitable, |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=442) |  and also on the positive side, when we work through the need to know, |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=450) |  we get to know in a radical new way called insight, or if you wish, wisdom, |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=457) |  or even in its most extreme form, enlightenment. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI4seVg0xjk&t=462) |  For these reasons, there is a need to work through the need to know. |

     What is the difference between eating and not eating? When a person who is a compulsive eater overcomes their eating compulsion, they don't stop eating. They continue to eat, but they eat in a different way. It's not driven, and it's healthier. With regards to our mind, the mind has a certain drive to find meaning. That drive, I think, is in some way intrinsic to the image-talk circuits themselves, but also is linked to feel. I define feel as emotional body sensation. When the mind finds meaning, you'll find a smile on your face, or a rosiness in your chest, or a frisson, a kind of ripple of pleasant excitement through your body. When the mind fails to find meaning, when the mind is confused, muddled, spinning to no avail, then you'll find in the body sensations of fear and tear, and impatience, agitation, and so forth. So, the drive to find meaning involves, I believe, a certain intrinsic drive in the image-talk circuits to establish pattern, and then some juice in the body, particularly with regards to the pleasure associated with finding answers and the discomfort in the body associated with being confused or not having answers, especially fear and sadness flavors. So, some combination of forces within feel-image-talk drive us to have meaning. We can train ourselves into equanimity with don't-know. It's a systematic training.
