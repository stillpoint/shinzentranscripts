    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=0) |  What is your view of the Buddha? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=5) |  I look upon the Buddha as a kind of spiritual scientist, a great innovative spiritual scientist. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=17) |  Shall we say the Isaac Newton of spirituality? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=22) |  After Newton appeared in the world, science really got going. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=28) |  Newton made some major innovations that set the course for science, or at least physical science as we now know it. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=43) |  The Buddha made a number of original discoveries that I think are as good as gold. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=51) |  They will stand the test of time in terms of the issue of ultimate human happiness and human spirituality. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=63) |  One of those discoveries was the principle of untangle and be free, |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=72) |  which I sometimes, in a somewhat more politically incorrect phraseology, like to describe as divide and conquer. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=82) |  Some people don't like that language, but divide and conquer means if you can break the complicated system into its natural components, |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=93) |  you will conquer ignorance, suffering, and the screwed up behaviors that come from ignorance and suffering. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=103) |  Divide and conquer actually is a nice phrase, but if you prefer the more gentle untangle and be free, we can use that phraseology also. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=115) |  In traditional Buddhist scriptures, early Buddhist scriptures, the Pali Canon, there are actually a number of systems or schemes for dividing and conquering the suffering self. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=134) |  One of them is the five-aggregate scheme, another one is the four foundations of mindfulness, |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=145) |  and another one is the four great elementsâ€”earth, water, air, and fire, or wind and fire. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=155) |  These were looked upon in those days as basic components of the world. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=161) |  I think it's important not to get fixated on a particular traditional classification scheme, |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=171) |  but rather to generalize the Buddha's discovery and realize that there are any number of ways of dividing the pie of self, |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=185) |  so that you can apply this general or basic principle of untangle and be free. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=193) |  The untangle and be free discovery basically says that when the elements that produce the sense of self are not distinct in awareness, |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=209) |  they create qualitative and quantitative illusions that magnify the sense of suffering, and that would be on the quantitative side. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=226) |  And on the qualitative side, even more important actually, produce an illusory quality within us. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=234) |  That illusory quality is the perception that there is a thing called a self inside us. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=242) |  When you untangle the strands, then the somethingness of self goes away, which, by the way, frees up the doingness of personality, |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=253) |  so you don't have to worry that you're going to lose something by untangling and being free. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=260) |  I use this classification system to apply the general principle of untangle and be free. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=269) |  I don't typically use the five aggregates of traditional Buddhism for a number of reasons. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=278) |  They're a little bit hard for beginning meditators to use practically. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=287) |  In fact, I don't think I know of a single teacher that actually has people make the deconstruction of the self the center of practice based on the five aggregates. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=301) |  I can generalize the concept of untangling the aggregates to untangling other types of components that are pretty closely related. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=312) |  We could say that a core sense of subjective self arises in the feel-image-talk system. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=325) |  I sometimes refer to that as the subjective self or the feeling-thinking self. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=332) |  The thinking part is in the image and talk. The feel part is here in the body. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=337) |  To the extent that you can track these in real time and keep them from tangling together, |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=344) |  to that extent the subjective self will be a home, not a prison. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=354) |  A little broader formulation would be what I refer to as body-mind-self. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=361) |  In that formulation, anything that happens in the body is a part of self, and anything that happens in the mind is part of self. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=371) |  From that somewhat broader perspective, we have touch, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=380) |  This is body and this is mind. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=383) |  I have people learn how to track these four and separate them. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=390) |  When people work just with the core subjective self, I call that technique focus-in, because you're working with the innermost components. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=399) |  This is my contemporary reworking of things like the four foundations of mindfulness or the five aggregates and so forth. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=413) |  After one separates out these elements, what's next? |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=420) |  Well, there's more to the deconstruction than simply the untangling of the strands. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=426) |  One then looks very carefully at each individual strand, and a unifying principle arises. |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=437) |  Here we have distinction. We distinguish subjective versus objective. |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=444) |  We distinguish somatic versus visual versus auditory. We distinguish ordinary versus restful. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=451) |  After you've teased out these sensory strands and look very carefully at them individually, you'll see that they're all made out of the same stuff. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=462) |  After productive kinds of discriminations are made, further careful observation brings us to a productive unification. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=473) |  It turns out that all of these sensory experiences are, upon very close investigation, seen to be made out of the same stuff, except it's not stuff. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=485) |  It's a verb, not a noun. It's a doing, a doing that could be described as a vibrant vacuity. |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0v70wPcs0c&t=498) |  The vacuity is a kind of transparency or refreshing nothingness, and the vibrance is a kind of dynamic flow upon which we ride and live our life in a bouncy and enthusiastic way, having seen beyond life. |
