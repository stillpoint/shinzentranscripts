    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=0) |  What are the facets of the experience of flow? |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=10) |  So there are many, many facets to the experience of flow. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=15) |  I use the word flow for any kind of change, |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=21) |  other than the abrupt vanishings. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=24) |  I have you work with the experience of something vanishing |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=29) |  as a special case of change that has a special significance |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=33) |  because each time you notice something vanish, |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=37) |  for just a fraction of a second, your attention is adverted, |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=41) |  turned towards a place that's outside of place and outside of time. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=47) |  That instant of vanishing turns you just instantaneously |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=52) |  towards the unborn source. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=54) |  The place where A disappears to is exactly the place |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=58) |  that gives birth to B in the next instant of experience. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=64) |  So when I have you work with the theme of change or impermanence, |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=69) |  you note vanishings, and then all other kinds of change, anything. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=76) |  I just use the word flow just to have a nice name for it. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=81) |  So how can things flow? |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=84) |  Well, it's nothing mystical. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=88) |  Something can get more intense or it can get less intense. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=93) |  If you've ever noticed something get more intense or less intense, |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=96) |  you've experienced flow, as I've described. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=99) |  A sensation could spread or it could collapse. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=103) |  Something could speed up your thoughts, |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=106) |  or a certain sensation someplace, its frequency could speed up |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=112) |  or it could slow down. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=114) |  There could be inward pressures, outward pressures. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=118) |  Even the scattering of your awareness, which is usually looked upon as a problem, |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=124) |  it's like I'm all over the place, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=126) |  that could simply be looked upon as a kind of expansive flow. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=131) |  And the gripping and holding, the obsessing, |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=134) |  the not being able to let go of something |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=137) |  or something holding you so you can't get free from it, |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=142) |  that certainly could be interpreted as a problem, |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=145) |  or it could be interpreted as simply a form of contractive flow. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=152) |  And in that sense, not a problem. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=156) |  So as you're paying attention to the kinds of ordinary experiences |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=162) |  that I just mentioned, things get more intense, less intense, |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=165) |  speed up, slow down, spread, collapse, |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=168) |  there's inward pressure force, outward pressure force, |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=172) |  scattering, gripping. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=175) |  As you're paying attention to that, |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=179) |  you could notice that all of the things that I've mentioned |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=186) |  involve an interplay of contrasts. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=191) |  There's like, okay, it can push out, it can push in. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=194) |  It can get more intense, it can get less intense. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=197) |  So if we were to abstract from this situation, |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=201) |  we could say that there's two basic principles underlying flow. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=208) |  A principle of increase, a principle of decrease. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=212) |  And there's many, many flavors and dimensions |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=215) |  within which the increase and decrease can express itself. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=220) |  And so we can give a general term to the principle of increase. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=226) |  We can call it expansion if you wish. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=228) |  And then we can give a general term to the principle of decrease. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=231) |  We can call it contraction. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=234) |  In between increase and decrease is a balance point |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=239) |  that we could call zero if we were using an additive metaphor. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=244) |  With regards to all of the different flavors that I mentioned, |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=250) |  as you're paying attention to things speeding up, slowing down, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=254) |  getting more intense, less intense, |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=256) |  pushing out, pulling in, scattering, gripping, |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=259) |  you might get a sense that accompanying |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=264) |  each one of these flavors of expansion and contraction |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=270) |  is a sense that space itself is expanding. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=275) |  The space of the experience is expanding or contracting. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=283) |  If, as you're practicing, that theme should come up, |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=288) |  you pay attention to expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=291) |  it has many, many guises, some of them not all that pleasant, |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=296) |  but you might notice that there's always an increase in space. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=302) |  Actually, it's an increase in time-space. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=306) |  Time-space gets inflated when things tend to get inflated, |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=311) |  when things intensify, when they speed up, |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=314) |  when there's outward pressure, etc., etc. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=317) |  Then space or time-space tends to collapse. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=321) |  So you could tune into the spaceness |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=327) |  associated with the flow of expansive and contractive flavors. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=334) |  And to the extent that you would tune into the spaceness, |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=337) |  you are tuning into the spacious nature of consciousness. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=342) |  This is a phrase that's used very much in the Dzogchen tradition |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=347) |  of Tibetan practice. They talk about spaciousness. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=351) |  Spaciousness is maybe not the best English word |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=355) |  because it implies a pre-existing, solidified stage called space |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=364) |  that somehow you're supposed to get in contact with. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=367) |  But I'm sure that that's not what that tradition is aiming at |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=371) |  when they say spaciousness, |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=373) |  because that's just a solidified perception. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=376) |  Spaciousness is the space nature of experience. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=385) |  When you have a complete experience, |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=388) |  it's utterly rich but utterly transparent, |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=393) |  and so presents itself as space itself. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=400) |  Sasaki Roshi says you must reach the point in your practice |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=406) |  where when you laugh, space is laughing, |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=411) |  and when you cry, space is crying. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=414) |  And it's very enigmatic. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=416) |  You can't guess what he's talking about. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=419) |  But then in a few months or a few years or a few decades, |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=424) |  you have this experience. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=426) |  Oh, yeah, of course, that would be the way to describe this. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=431) |  So if you can fight long enough against spaciness, |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=440) |  the reward you get is, quote, spaciousness, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=444) |  which is really spaceness. |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=447) |  It may seem bleak, but it incorporates the richness |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMSvui-6Kc&t=452) |  of everything within it. |
