    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=0) |  The forcing yourself to say the labels has caused the invisible force of scatter to come |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=14) |  up as a tangible sensation of impatience. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=19) |  You can detect it in the body, right? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=22) |  Now start noting that. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=24) |  You can either note the impatient locations or just note it as feel if you want to use |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=30) |  a generic technique. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=31) |  So let's say that you're noting feel image talk, okay? |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=36) |  And the image and talk go away because you're forcing yourself to say the labels out loud. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=41) |  However, what happens to feel is that now there's an agitated, uncomfortable quality |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=47) |  of feel. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=48) |  So then you would note feel, feel with spoken labels and the more you speak, the more that |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=55) |  discomfort comes up. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=57) |  But that's good because that's observable. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=61) |  That's a somatic quality. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=66) |  It has location. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=67) |  It has intensity. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=70) |  It has flavor in the body. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=72) |  You can observe it and you can open up to it. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=75) |  The whole idea in doing something like spoken labels is to take invisible patterns of force |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=85) |  that scatter our attention and transmute them into observable patterns of sensation or perhaps |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=94) |  also image talk, but usually it's an agitated sensation, an observable pattern of sensation |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=102) |  that you can then work with because invisible patterns of force are extremely difficult |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=109) |  to work with. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=110) |  It's what you described. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=111) |  They just got you. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=112) |  It's like you're observing and now you're not observing. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=117) |  You're not on the edge of the stream. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=122) |  You have entered the stream and not in the good sense of that term. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=128) |  You're not being carried by the stream of enlightenment. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=133) |  You're being drowned in the stream of karma. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=135) |  Now you're uncomfortable in the body. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=137) |  That means that the spoken labels have made an invisible pattern of force that's been |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=142) |  scattering you into an observable, trackable pattern of sensation, albeit perhaps a very |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=152) |  uncomfortable sensation, but it is still trackable and you can note that sensation. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=160) |  What is trackable eventually becomes tractable and you will have worked through the invisible |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=168) |  scattering force, which is intractable. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=171) |  One of the very elegant and clever features of mindfulness practice is, I repeat, it takes |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=179) |  invisible and intractable problem, which is forces are controlling me that I don't like |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=189) |  and there's nothing I can do about it. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=192) |  It transforms that problem, a problem of dealing with invisible forces, into the problem of |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=200) |  observing actual body sensations. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=206) |  Then as you equantimize that, you solve that problem, that translates back into, now those |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=212) |  forces no longer have a hold on you. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=216) |  Huge fundamental tool. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=220) |  That's why it may have sounded cavalier and even mean when I said, oh, that's great. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=226) |  You're all agitated and miserable because you're doing the spoken labels, but it was |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=230) |  neither cavalier nor mean. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=234) |  That's the name of the game. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=240) |  Solid mouthing, sotto voce labeling. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=245) |  If that doesn't work, then stay away from the zendo for half a day and just force yourself |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=249) |  to do the labels. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=251) |  I know people don't want to do it, but it works. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=255) |  You don't have that much time. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=257) |  You have lives. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=259) |  You took time away from your lives. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=261) |  You paid money to come here to do some work. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=266) |  I'm ethically bound to tell you what's going to make that effective, even though it might |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=272) |  not be what you want to hear. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=279) |  There's three reasons people don't want to do spoken labels. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=284) |  Number one, it's very hard work. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=288) |  We sort of think, well, I came here to have this mellow experience. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=293) |  I don't want to have to work. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=295) |  It's hard work, but that's what we came to do. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=299) |  First cause of resistance, it's hard work. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=302) |  Second cause, it's going to make you uncomfortable, hopefully. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=309) |  And third is, this proves what I've always known. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=313) |  I'm a child of a lesser God. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=315) |  I've been sent back to Vipassana, one only. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=320) |  Also known as Dumbbell Vipassana. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=324) |  So yes, I've been sent back to Dumbbell Vipassana. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=330) |  But here's my metaphor. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=333) |  Remember I say that you have these labeling options, strongly spoken label, middle spoken |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=339) |  label, whispered label, mental label, no label at all. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=345) |  It's true, it's as a general principle, you want to work towards actually no labels at |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=352) |  all, if possible. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=355) |  But you can think of those label options as like gears in your car. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=365) |  If you're going up a steep hill, meaning what makes a hill steep as you're sitting, is one |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=375) |  or both of the following. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=377) |  Lot of doo doo coming from the outside world, lot of doo doo coming from the inside world. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=384) |  So one or both of those means you're going up a hill. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=389) |  The fact that when you go up a very steep hill, you have to put your Rolls Royce into |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=398) |  first gear, doesn't mean it's not a Rolls Royce. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=403) |  It has a first gear for a reason. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=407) |  Those options are there for a reason. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=409) |  It's not being sent back to Dumbbell Vipassana. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=412) |  It's using the standard apparatus of the technique in the way that it was suggested you use it. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=423) |  So it's like, no, I don't care what, I'm not going to put my car in first gear, I'm going |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=428) |  to go up this hill under cruise control, I don't care what. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=436) |  I don't want anybody to tell me this is a crummy car. |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=439) |  It doesn't work that way. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRPfi_Bw1pQ&t=441) |  It's a piece of machinery, it's designed to work that way. |
