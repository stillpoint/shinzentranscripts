    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=0) |  What are the great masters of the past? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=7) |  The great masters of the past have never really been able to get around this. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=15) |  Some of them will emphasize the bearing down aspect. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=20) |  Certainly the Buddha was in that camp. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=24) |  Some of them will emphasize the easing up aspect, like Papaji. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=30) |  I love the title of his book, Call Off the Search. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=33) |  That's my term for the sort of like ease up and stop striving for enlightenment. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=47) |  So the Buddha talked about the noble quest. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=51) |  Papaji talks about Call Off the Search. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=55) |  Which one is right? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=57) |  Well, they're both right. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=60) |  So then the question, well, how do you know when to bear down? |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=64) |  How do you know when to ease up? |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=67) |  I don't have any magic formula for that. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=72) |  I can tell you how I, in my own teaching, attempt to deal with the paradox. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=79) |  My way of dealing with it is to give people techniques that allow them to bear down, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=90) |  that would emphasize that aspect, |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=93) |  but also to give them a very clear description of how to practice in a non-efforting way. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=101) |  And the non-efforting practice, which you can read about on my websites, I call do nothing. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=108) |  It's basically my reworking of that whole choiceless awareness, dzogchen, just sit, |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=117) |  what some people would call just sitting anyway, that whole approach to things, the Call Off the Search approach. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=124) |  I call it do nothing. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=126) |  And so my way of dealing with the paradox is say, |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=129) |  okay, I'm going to give you these techniques that involve noting, touch site sound or feel image talk, etc., etc. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=140) |  And there's some effort involved in that. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=144) |  You're trying to separate phenomena, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=146) |  and you're trying to soak your attention into the phenomenon when it arises. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=152) |  So here are some techniques within which it's natural to somewhat bear down. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=160) |  Here's another approach, which gives you a description of how to let go of the intention to do anything at all, |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=169) |  without having an intention to let go of the intention, which is sort of tricky. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=175) |  If you read the description of how to do nothing, you'll see how I try to get around that. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=182) |  I give people both approaches, and I encourage them to do both, to try both. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=189) |  My stock phrase is, if the noting makes you racy, then do nothing, as I define do nothing. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=200) |  If the do nothing makes you spacey, then go back to the noting. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=204) |  So now you have both approaches worked into the system, or worked into a system, so that they can sample both and work with both. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=220) |  I think because it is a paradox and because both are true, that the single most important thing is to not get one-sided. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=232) |  I see this all the time. Yes, indeed. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=237) |  One of the characteristic dangers that you can get with mindfulness practice is that people get goal-driven, |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=247) |  and there is a drivenness in the way that they do it. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=254) |  You can actually get that in any spiritual practice. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=258) |  The medicine for that would be to learn that you don't have to practice that way. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=267) |  On the other hand, I have also seen people get addicted to the have-no-goal approach. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=277) |  They spend their whole life, in daily life, they are unconscious and driven, but they are afraid to do any noting technique in their formal practice, |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=290) |  because somehow that is going to pollute their consciousness. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=294) |  They actually develop an aversion or a phobia of any bearing down whatsoever in formal practice. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=303) |  As I say, it is sort of ridiculous, because in daily life they are constantly giving in to those kinds of forces of drivenness, |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=317) |  but they are afraid to have any even hint of a goal in practice. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=321) |  That is a kind of phobia. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=323) |  I think that my way of trying to deal with this is, well, get familiar with both ways of working, |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=330) |  so that there is a kind of freedom that you could do either one. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=335) |  In fact, I would say that the test for either of the approaches is your ability to do the other approach. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=345) |  If you have been doing a high-efforting approach, how do we know it is working? |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=352) |  Well, you should be able to drop all effort if it worked, and do a no-effort, no-meditation form of meditation. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=363) |  If you have been efforting and you claim that it has been successful and productive, |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=369) |  then you should be able to do a non-effort practice without any problem at all. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=378) |  It works the other way, too. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=380) |  If you claim that you have been productively doing a non-effort practice, a call-off-the-search practice, |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=390) |  then the result of that should be that you have this very high concentration, clarity, and equanimity skills, |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=400) |  even though you have had no particular goal to develop those in any systematic way. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=407) |  Therefore, the gold standard for testing, in my mind, the efficacy, the progress in a call-off-the-search approach, |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=421) |  would be can you implement highly systematic focusing techniques like noting? |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=430) |  Are you able and willing to do this? |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=434) |  Well, then your call-off-the-search has been successful. |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=439) |  Conversely, if you have been searching very hard and bearing down, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=444) |  that should result in the ability to completely let go of all direction and goal in practice. |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=452) |  If not, then you have been making efforts without the progress that you should be making, |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfDTAqlZ7dc&t=461) |  and maybe you need to balance by doing the other approach. |
