    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=0) |  If you think of the spiritual journey as a journey from surface to source, in making |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=10) |  that journey, some people will have blissful dissolution, that they just sort of dissolve |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=17) |  back into the flow and go of the source. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=22) |  Some people have these horrific dissolutions that if they can stay with it, then become |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=28) |  blissful and eventually just purely blissful. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=33) |  Some people get a mixture of both, and some are not particularly aware of going through |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=37) |  a dissolution process, so it's not required. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=41) |  I do talk about these things and other teachers talk about them because we want to give you |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=46) |  the heads up, just in case it happens to you. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=49) |  Basically, you need to know two things, why is this happening and what am I going to do |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=53) |  about it? |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=54) |  So we do talk about it. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=56) |  The advantage is that if it does happen, you know why it's happening and what to do about |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=60) |  it. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=61) |  But the disadvantage is, if we talk about it, some people listening will say, that hasn't |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=67) |  happened to me yet, so I must be the child of a lesser god, I'm not really making progress. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=73) |  They're not missing that. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=74) |  Well, it depends. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=76) |  Not always as rough as you had. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=82) |  People think, well, I haven't experienced that so I must not be making progress, so |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=87) |  there's that problem. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=89) |  And then other people think, oh my god, I hope that doesn't happen to me, and there's |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=94) |  that problem. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=95) |  And then other people are thinking, wow, I wish that would happen to me. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=99) |  There are problems involved in explicitly talking about these phenomena. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=103) |  It scares people or it creates craving or comparison mind. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=107) |  But I think it's still worth talking about. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=109) |  Definitely. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=110) |  Get it out there. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=111) |  Because I think if you wouldn't have been there, I would have gone for psychiatric help. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=118) |  And that could have had tragic consequences because... |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=121) |  They may not have understood. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=123) |  There's actually something called the Spiritual Emergence Network, you know about this, that |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=128) |  was created because they realized people who were having spiritual experiences didn't have |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=133) |  someone to talk to. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=135) |  They go into the mental health system, while those mental health professionals in prior |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=141) |  times didn't know about this stuff. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=143) |  And the Spiritual Emergence Network was designed to inform mental health professionals that |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=150) |  hey, just because somebody's reporting the kind of things you're reporting doesn't necessarily |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=156) |  mean they're losing their marbles and that they necessarily need to be put in chemical |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=162) |  restraints. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=163) |  I can see the importance of that. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=164) |  You know, there could have been horrific consequences or tragic consequences if you had gotten somebody |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=170) |  that didn't understand the difference between dissolution and insanity. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=175) |  I would say the single most important thing if a person goes through an experience like |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=180) |  this is you've got to have somebody to talk to who's actually themselves been through |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=185) |  it. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=186) |  I made it through to the other end. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=188) |  That's like, that's the cure. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=190) |  Okay, more than anything it's like, okay, find somebody who's actually experienced this. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=195) |  Then they'll take you through it. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=197) |  Isn't that what I said I would do? |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=199) |  And you're more or less through it, aren't you? |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=201) |  I mean, you had a little recurrence today, but... |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=205) |  It's taken on a different texture. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=209) |  That initial destabilization is still going on in different areas in my life. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=219) |  But you've acclimatized. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=220) |  Well, every time you acclimatize to something or some fixed reference point, that seems |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=226) |  to, the carpet gets pulled out. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=229) |  Zen master Rinzai talked about finding that true person within you who has no fixed position. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=238) |  Wu wei zhen ran. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=242) |  That's what you're being called on to do. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=244) |  Those are great words, and I've read a hundred spiritual books that thought, wow, I'd like |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=250) |  to be free. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=251) |  I want to find that true person within me that has no fixed position. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=256) |  Be careful what you pray for. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=258) |  Absolutely, because it's not like I have ever imagined. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=261) |  There is no informed consent to enlightenment. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=266) |  It's both not as good as, and much better than, you fantasized. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=273) |  And I realized that for most of my life, my spiritual model was wrong, in that I was a |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=281) |  person, an ego, that was going to have more awareness, that I was going to make a better |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=287) |  me, a new, improved me, with more consciousness. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=290) |  You were going to polish a brick into a mirror. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=293) |  I was going to be a better, new, improved version of myself. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=299) |  But instead you discovered that you're a brick that gets smashed into a trillion pieces and |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=304) |  vaporized. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=306) |  And what I realized is that it's not that some kind of perfection gets added to me. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=313) |  I get erased. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=316) |  I get erased, and the perfection that was always there becomes clear and starts to shine. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=322) |  That's called a figure-ground reversal. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=325) |  And that's wisdom that's speaking through you now, to say those words. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=329) |  That's exactly how it works. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=331) |  I would never have guessed it from reading the books. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=334) |  Can you repeat that? |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=335) |  I interrupted you. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=336) |  That was really good. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=337) |  No, just what you said. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=340) |  You thought it was... |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=341) |  Well, I always thought spirituality was adding something, becoming bigger and bigger. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=344) |  More consciousness, more power, more clarity, more focus, more success in my life. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=350) |  And then I realized that what spirituality is about is not having a self that has that |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=357) |  at all. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=358) |  And that those powerful qualities are just always there in creation all the time when |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=363) |  you step out of the way. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=365) |  And the price for that is? |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=367) |  Everything. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=368) |  As T.S. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=369) |  Eliot said. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=370) |  Everything you ever believed in, everything you ever thought you were. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=376) |  It's a very humbling experience. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=382) |  But I wouldn't give it up for anything at this point. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=386) |  I want to thank you for kicking me into this place, for jump-starting. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEit-DtWQ38&t=395) |  Excellent, yeah. |
