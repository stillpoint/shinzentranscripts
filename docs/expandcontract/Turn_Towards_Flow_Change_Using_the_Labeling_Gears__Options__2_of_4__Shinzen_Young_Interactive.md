    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=0) |  Let's begin by turning your attention towards the itchy sensations wherever they may be |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=16) |  in the body. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=18) |  And I'd like you to focus in on the sort of prickly change, the fact that it's sort of |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=26) |  like popping and bubbling kind of thing. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=30) |  Just focus on that, how there's these sort of constant little sparks or scintillations. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=45) |  And get interested in that for a moment. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=49) |  And I'd like you to label that with the word flow. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=57) |  And I'd like you to say flow out loud every four, five, six seconds to acknowledge that |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=63) |  you're focusing on how the itch is changing continuously. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=68) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=70) |  So we'll call this noting the flow with spoken labels. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=76) |  And I'd like you to do that now for a couple minutes. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=81) |  By listening to the pace of your labels and the tone of voice, that will give me an idea |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=86) |  of how you're working with this experience. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=94) |  Flow. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=98) |  Flow. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=102) |  Flow. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=108) |  Flow. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=114) |  Flow. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=120) |  Good. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=126) |  The pacing of your labels is excellent. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=131) |  I'd like you to change the tone, though, a little bit, more to a kind of gentle, matter-of-fact, |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=140) |  impersonal quality in the voice. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=143) |  It may seem artificial, but it can influence consciousness. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=148) |  Something more like this. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=153) |  Flow. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=160) |  Flow. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=163) |  That kind of quality. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=164) |  And then in between the labels, you're intently focusing on that flow. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=170) |  And then you re-acknowledge with the label. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=172) |  And you use the gentle, matter-of-fact quality in the voice to remind you to be gentle and |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=178) |  matter-of-fact with the sensation. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=181) |  That's using the voice to induce equanimity. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=184) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=186) |  Yes. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=187) |  Excellent. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=188) |  Let's try to do it that way. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=195) |  Flow. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=201) |  Flow. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=210) |  Flow. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=211) |  That's perfect. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=213) |  Now, shift to mental labels. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=217) |  Think those words. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=219) |  Or that word. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=220) |  But as you think that word, let your mental voice also have that gentle, matter-of-fact |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=226) |  tone to it. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=227) |  And that will constantly be reminding you to have equanimity. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=231) |  The tone of the labeling voice induces equanimity. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=236) |  The even pacing, not too fast, not too slow, guarantees concentration. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=243) |  And then the precision of the words that you use to label the phenomena, that guarantees |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=249) |  the sensory clarity. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=251) |  So can you see how the labeling process sort of guarantees each of the three components |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=257) |  of mindful awareness? |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=259) |  Yes. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=260) |  Does that concept make sense to you? |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=261) |  Yes. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=262) |  Excellent. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=263) |  So now I'd like you to continue to note the flow using mental labels. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=275) |  How's that coming, Lorraine? |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=277) |  It's coming. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=278) |  It's really slowed down. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=280) |  Is there more of a wavy quality to it? |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=284) |  When you say it's slowed down. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=285) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=286) |  I think the prickliness is sort of softened and it's turning more wavy. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=293) |  Would you say that the wavy sensations are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=299) |  I guess I'd have to say neutral. |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=307) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=309) |  I'd like you to focus in on that. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=312) |  And that means to the extent that you focus on that neutrality, you don't have the sense |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=319) |  of discomfort. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=320) |  Is that correct? |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=321) |  Right. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=322) |  So keep focusing on the sort of massage of that wavy flow. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=328) |  Keep noting it as flow. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=330) |  Open up to it and sort of think of it as a kind of massage that at worst is neutral. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=341) |  And could potentially at some point actually become pleasant. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=347) |  But as long as it's at least neutral, you're focusing on that movement and you're less |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=353) |  caught up in the sense of having a physical discomfort. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=358) |  Does that notion make sense? |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=362) |  Yes. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=363) |  Excellent. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=364) |  So keep doing just what you're doing. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=366) |  You're doing great. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=389) |  Is that wavy flow still present? |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=392) |  It is. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=393) |  It's being sort of challenged by this pulsing that's starting to assert itself. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=400) |  And is the pulsing literally the pulse from the circulation of blood? |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=407) |  I don't know. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=410) |  I feel it more close to my elbow, which is not generally a place where you feel a pulse. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=418) |  And the pulsing is a painful sensation? |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=423) |  It's neutral too, I'd have to say. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=426) |  But it's a little distracting. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=428) |  Could you interpret the pulsing as a kind of flow? |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=431) |  Yes. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=432) |  It's just changing the pace. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=436) |  So you could add the pulsing as a part of the neutral flow. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=441) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=442) |  And is there anything pleasant in any of the flow at this time, or is it still more or less a neutral thing? |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=454) |  I think there is a degree of pleasantness to it. |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=458) |  Is it possible to describe in what sense the flow is pleasant? |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=464) |  It's just because it's really slow and almost calming. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=469) |  Good. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=471) |  And if you need to, use your concentration power to focus on how the flow is pleasant. |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=478) |  And let that sort of massage you, nurture you, take you deeper and deeper, comfort you. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=488) |  But also sort of energize you. |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=490) |  So it's a kind of positive energy for you. |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=497) |  Just keep noting flow. |
    | [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=499) |  If you wish, you can drop the mental label and just do it moment by moment with direct awareness. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=507) |  Or you can reinstate the mental label if you get a little spaced out. |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=511) |  And if you get really spaced out, I'd like you to start speaking the labels out loud again. |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=518) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=519) |  Yes. |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=520) |  So that's sort of like a quality control. |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=523) |  If you go up a hill, go into first gear, speak the labels and use the voice the way we did, the pacing, the tone, and so forth. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=533) |  If you're just sort of driving along, you can go into the mental labels. |
    | [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=551) |  And if you really get on a momentum, you can drop the labels, go into cruise control, and just do it with direct awareness. |
    | [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=563) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zz_BfTdp4E&t=564) |  Yes. |

     Let's begin by turning your attention towards the itchy sensations wherever they may be in the body. And I'd like you to focus in on the sort of prickly change, the fact that it's sort of like popping and bubbling kind of thing. Just focus on that, how there's these sort of constant little sparks or scintillations. And get interested in that for a moment. And I'd like you to label that with the word flow. And I'd like you to say flow out loud every four, five, six seconds to acknowledge that you're focusing on how the itch is changing continuously. Does that make sense? So we'll call this noting the flow with spoken labels. And I'd like you to do that now for a couple minutes. By listening to the pace of your labels and the tone of voice, that will give me an idea of how you're working with this experience. Flow. Flow. Flow. Flow. Flow. Good. The pacing of your labels is excellent. I'd like you to change the tone, though, a little bit, more to a kind of gentle, matter-of-fact, impersonal quality in the voice. It may seem artificial, but it can influence consciousness. Something more like this. Flow. Flow. That kind of quality. And then in between the labels, you're intently focusing on that flow. And then you re-acknowledge with the label. And you use the gentle, matter-of-fact quality in the voice to remind you to be gentle and matter-of-fact with the sensation. That's using the voice to induce equanimity. Does that make sense? Yes. Excellent. Let's try to do it that way. Flow. Flow. Flow. That's perfect. Now, shift to mental labels. Think those words. Or that word. But as you think that word, let your mental voice also have that gentle, matter-of-fact tone to it. And that will constantly be reminding you to have equanimity. The tone of the labeling voice induces equanimity. The even pacing, not too fast, not too slow, guarantees concentration. And then the precision of the words that you use to label the phenomena, that guarantees the sensory clarity. So can you see how the labeling process sort of guarantees each of the three components of mindful awareness? Yes. Does that concept make sense to you? Yes. Excellent. So now I'd like you to continue to note the flow using mental labels. How's that coming, Lorraine? It's coming. It's really slowed down. Is there more of a wavy quality to it? When you say it's slowed down. Yeah. I think the prickliness is sort of softened and it's turning more wavy. Would you say that the wavy sensations are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? I guess I'd have to say neutral. Okay, good. I'd like you to focus in on that. And that means to the extent that you focus on that neutrality, you don't have the sense of discomfort. Is that correct? Right. So keep focusing on the sort of massage of that wavy flow. Keep noting it as flow. Open up to it and sort of think of it as a kind of massage that at worst is neutral. And could potentially at some point actually become pleasant.

So you could add the pulsing as a part of the neutral flow. Yeah. And is there anything pleasant in any of the flow at this time, or is it still more or less a neutral thing? I think there is a degree of pleasantness to it. Is it possible to describe in what sense the flow is pleasant? It's just because it's really slow and almost calming. Good. And if you need to, use your concentration power to focus on how the flow is pleasant. And let that sort of massage you, nurture you, take you deeper and deeper, comfort you.
