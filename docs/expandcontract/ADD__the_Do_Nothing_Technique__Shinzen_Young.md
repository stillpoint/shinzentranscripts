    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=34) |  The way to make sure you're doing it in an optimal way is, at least occasionally, touch |

    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=46) |  In other words, as far as just using that technique, hey, that's a classic path that |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=53) |  will take you all the way to classic enlightenment. |

    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=120) |  and it's the only one that works for you, certainly that in theory is sufficient. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=125) |  Go for it. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=126) |  But try to get some input from someone familiar with that, once or twice a year at least, |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=134) |  so that you know that you're on course. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNV6Y_JlhoA&t=137) |  Also if it works, a sign of that would be that somewhere down the line your ADD will |
