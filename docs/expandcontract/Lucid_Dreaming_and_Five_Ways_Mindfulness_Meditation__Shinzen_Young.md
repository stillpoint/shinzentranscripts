    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=0) |  Lucid dreaming is the ability to know you're dreaming when you're dreaming. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=15) |  All indications are that it's quite trainable, that the average person can actually learn |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=22) |  how to do this with the proper training. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=26) |  There's some great websites on the internet that will teach you how to do it. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=32) |  The question is, if you're applying the basic mindfulness system in a dream, what are the |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=40) |  sensory categories that you're dealing with? |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=43) |  Are the sights that you see in the dream actually to be labeled as image? |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=49) |  How about what seems to be touch and so forth? |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=55) |  Are the sounds really sound or are they talk? |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=60) |  It does sort of make sense as a question because what's going on in the dream is clearly not |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=70) |  based on external physical stimuli usually. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=76) |  It's very easy. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=78) |  I can tell you from my own experience, applying the five ways, working with touch, sight, |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=84) |  sound, feel, image, talk, et cetera, essentially you can consider the dreaming world to be |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=93) |  the same as the waking world. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=98) |  If it seems to you that you're looking at an external sight, even though that's generated |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=103) |  obviously from the inside because you're dreaming, you name it as sight. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=109) |  The dreaming world is like the waking world. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=112) |  There are touch, sight, sounds. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=114) |  There can be internal talk. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=117) |  Theoretically, there could even be mental images, sort of images inside images in a |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=123) |  sense. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=125) |  The upshot is that consider the dreaming world to be like the waking world and apply the |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=134) |  techniques as you would in the waking world. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=138) |  Essentially, what happens to meditators is that whoever they are in their waking life, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=146) |  that's who they are in their dream life. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=148) |  Since they are meditators in their waking life, they can also be meditators in their |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=153) |  dream life. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=155) |  The same techniques that you would apply in the waking life, you apply in the dream life. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=161) |  It just carries over exactly. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=163) |  I label the things that I see in my dreams, if I'm intentionally meditating in my dream |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=170) |  and I see something, I don't label it as image. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=173) |  I label it as sight. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=176) |  It's amazing. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=178) |  If I physically contact an object, I'll be thinking to myself, and of course that thinking |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=184) |  is talk, right? |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=185) |  I'll be thinking to myself, okay, I'm dreaming, so I'll touch this object. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=191) |  What happens? |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=192) |  Okay, well, it's touch. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=193) |  It seems like touch in the external world. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=196) |  But then when I remember that I'm dreaming, I say to myself, oh, but since this is dream, |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=203) |  actually, I should be able to put my hand through this solid object. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=208) |  As soon as I have that talk, I can't. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=213) |  The solid object just sort of becomes like clay or something like that. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=218) |  I can actually ghostly move my hand through it, which I can't do in the physical world. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=223) |  So that is a difference. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=225) |  But it's still touch until it starts to behave weird. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=230) |  But I just take that as a sign of flow. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=232) |  It's much easier to get flow phenomenon. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=236) |  Normally, you can't get too much flow phenomenon in touching a physical wall. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=241) |  You can get a little bit of it, but the sight and the touch is usually fairly solidified |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=247) |  in the waking world, unless you're in a really, really deep state. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=250) |  But in the dream world, at least for myself, when I remember that I'm dreaming, then the |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=255) |  touch and the sight just instantly melts and turns into flow and whatever. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=261) |  I've also discovered that... Well, I consider smells and tastes to be sort of part of touch. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=271) |  You certainly can get smell and taste in a dream. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=274) |  It can be very interesting, actually. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=276) |  I was once in this dream and I was climbing this tree. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=281) |  I said to myself, okay, let's make this tree edible. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=287) |  I want this tree to be made of Turkish delight. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=291) |  And it immediately turned into Turkish delight. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=293) |  I started to eat vast quantities of the Turkish delight tree that I was climbing. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=300) |  I could taste it. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=301) |  It tasted just like Turkish delight in the real world, except it was in the dream and |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=307) |  there was a certain degree of control because you could just think it and it sort of becomes |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=312) |  what you want. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=315) |  The point in meditating in your dreams, by the way, is not to play games like what I |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=321) |  just described. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=323) |  The point is that when you're in the dream state, you're deep in consciousness and it's |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=329) |  a wonderful venue to explore the standard techniques. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=334) |  They all work. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=335) |  Any of the five ways you can apply just the way you do in the waking world, you can apply |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=340) |  it in the dreaming world. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=342) |  And then you're making productive use of that dream time. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=345) |  It's optimal use of your time. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=347) |  You're getting meditation mileage out of it. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwctdxAn9v4&t=351) |  So that would be my answer to that question. |

     Lucid dreaming is the ability to know you're dreaming when you're dreaming.
