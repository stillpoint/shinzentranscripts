    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=0) |  Can you tell me what enlightenment is? |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=9) |  So moment by moment, you've probably noticed that you have thoughts, right? |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=16) |  Is that correct? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=18) |  And moment by moment, you've probably noticed that you have body sensations. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=24) |  You've also probably noticed that as soon as a thought arises or a body sensation arises, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=30) |  there's a tendency to say, this thought is me, that this sensation is me. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=36) |  Is that correct? |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=39) |  Nothing mysterious so far. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=42) |  The next part, you have to sort of use your imagination. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=46) |  Imagine that you still had thoughts and you still had body sensations, but they no longer |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=55) |  immediately trapped your identity. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=59) |  So your identity is free, free to be inside your mind and body like it was before, but |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=67) |  also free to move outside of your mind and body, to inhabit briefly anyone's mind and |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=73) |  body, to merge with them, or to embrace the entire universe, or to abide at the still |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=84) |  point of the turning world beyond time and space, the nothingness that precedes the Big |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=91) |  Bang, so to speak, metaphorically speaking. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=96) |  So after enlightenment, people's identity becomes elastic and the mind and body is no |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=107) |  longer a place you're locked in. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=112) |  It's a home you comfortably can abide in, but you can leave anytime you want. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu_GvP2pfGc&t=121) |  And that's why we also call it liberation, being set free. |

     Can you tell me what enlightenment is? So moment by moment, you've probably noticed that you have thoughts, right? Is that correct? And moment by moment, you've probably noticed that you have body sensations. You've also probably noticed that as soon as a thought arises or a body sensation arises, there's a tendency to say, this thought is me, that this sensation is me. Is that correct? Nothing mysterious so far. The next part, you have to sort of use your imagination. Imagine that you still had thoughts and you still had body sensations, but they no longer immediately trapped your identity. So your identity is free, free to be inside your mind and body like it was before, but also free to move outside of your mind and body, to inhabit briefly anyone's mind and body, to merge with them, or to embrace the entire universe, or to abide at the still point of the turning world beyond time and space, the nothingness that precedes the Big Bang, so to speak, metaphorically speaking. So after enlightenment, people's identity becomes elastic and the mind and body is no longer a place you're locked in. It's a home you comfortably can abide in, but you can leave anytime you want. And that's why we also call it liberation, being set free.
