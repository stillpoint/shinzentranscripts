    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=0) |  As I say, this was one of the things that really sold me on the whole meditative endeavor |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=11) |  initially was, wow, there's this taste of this concentrated state. And I could see as |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=20) |  I work on it, it deepens and I'm able to maintain it in more and more complex situations. And |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=27) |  I'd always liked working on things. I'd always liked developing things, skills, stuff like |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=33) |  that. So it's like, this is cool. I can develop this. It is intrinsically fulfilling. It makes |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=42) |  uncomfortable experiences less problematic. And it's known all over the world. It's like |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=49) |  really cool. I'm linked to people from very different cultures, from very different belief |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=56) |  systems, but they shared this practice. They had a word for it. I'm doing the same thing |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=63) |  they did. And that was sort of cool to feel connected in that sense to a worldwide phenomenon. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=72) |  Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has been able to actually demonstrate with credible research this intrinsic |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=79) |  reward that goes with tasting high concentration. And he coined a word for it. There's good |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=89) |  news and there's bad news. The good news is it's a great word. That means the intrinsic |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=95) |  reward that goes with high concentration. So that's the good news. The bad news is unfortunately |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=102) |  it's the same word that I use for a different phenomenon. So that could cause some confusion |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=110) |  for people working within my system. Mihaly wrote a book with the title. So what was the, |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=118) |  what's the, what does he call it? Flow. Flow. Yeah. And if you talk about a flow state among |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=125) |  people that are interested in consciousness or this kind of thing, they'll know that that |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=132) |  refers to that. Now in my system it refers to working with change and energy and that |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=139) |  kind of thing. Now they're of course not entirely unrelated because as you get more and more |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=145) |  focused there's more and more of a tendency to be aware of how things change and the underlying |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=153) |  energies and forces. But conceptually in basic mindfulness and in positive psychology flow |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=160) |  refer to things that are distinct but it's the same word that's used in English. There |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=166) |  is another term that's commonly used in the athletic world for states of high concentration. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=173) |  And do you know what that term is? Zone. Be in the zone and so forth. So there are colloquial |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=179) |  words for this in ordinary English. Because it's such an important phenomenon both in |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=186) |  terms of sensory issues of being more fulfilled, suffering less, and in terms of objective |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=197) |  performance abilities. It's an important notion. So I think it's useful to create a definition |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=204) |  of concentration power. My definition of concentration power or just concentration for short is the |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=217) |  ability to attend to what you consider to be relevant at a given time. So notice what |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=228) |  I said, the ability to attend to what you consider to be relevant. So you decide what's |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=232) |  relevant at a given time. And what's relevant for you might not be relevant for some other |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=239) |  person. Also at one time something is relevant, at another time some other thing is relevant. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=247) |  Often in the definition of concentration there is a mention of restricting the attention, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=254) |  narrowing the attention. That's not in my definition of concentration. Certainly it's |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=261) |  true that there are contractive flavors of concentration. If you place your attention |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=267) |  on the breath going in and out of your nostrils or the sensation of your abdomen rising and |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=273) |  falling, those are very small touch sensations. And if you hold your attention there, you |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=283) |  have now deemed that small sensation to be what's relevant. Your attention wanders, you |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=289) |  bring it back, wanders, you bring it back. So yes, that is a contractive flavor of concentration. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=296) |  And there's a place for that. However, let's say that you were to intentionally create |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=304) |  a positive image, at the very same time intentionally create some internal talk that matched that |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=311) |  image, and talk that you repeated like a mantra over and over again, and at the same time |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=321) |  were to generate positive emotional feeling related to that image and that talk, and you |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=327) |  were to spread your awareness over all three of these sensory phenomena simultaneously |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=333) |  and hold that. That would be a very expansive flavor of concentration. You'd be filling |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=340) |  your entire subjective space with awareness. But that would develop the same flavor, the |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=348) |  same taste as you would get by focusing in a very small part of your experience. So my |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=357) |  teacher Sasaki Roshi says, everybody thinks that samadhi means narrowing the focus, but |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=364) |  you have to understand there are two flavors of samadhi, contractive samadhi and expansive |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=373) |  samadhi. If you're driving the car, what's by and large relevant is the touch-sight sound. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=381) |  Touch meaning the physical linkage with the car, sights meaning the sights of the road, |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=385) |  sounds meaning the sounds of the road. What's largely relevant in driving the car is touch-sight |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=391) |  sound, which is actually a fairly broad focus. Once you understand this, you can drive in |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=402) |  rush hour traffic for two hours, arrive at your destination, and you'll be in the same |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=409) |  state of deep repose as if you had your awareness focused on the tip of your nose for two hours |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=427) |  in formal seated meditation practice without the attention wavering. It would be no less |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=434) |  of a deep experience, even though it was a very large and complex piece of a sensory |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=444) |  event. Another misconception is that in order to develop concentration, you're always going |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=453) |  to be fighting with yourself because other things come up and you have to sort of push |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=460) |  them away or push them down in order to hold on to the thing that you're concentrating |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=467) |  on. I spent many, many years wrongly practicing concentration. Without realizing it, I was |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=477) |  subtly trying to suppress things. I would decide what I wanted to focus on in my early |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=483) |  period of practice. That was typically the breath. I would be focusing on the breath |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=489) |  and then when other things would come up, without realizing it, I was subtly tensing |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=496) |  around them. I was subtly trying to push them out of awareness. I was subtly trying to push |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=502) |  them down. I had this subliminal agenda that was aversive to anything that was a distraction. |
    | [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=509) |  That creates tension and that dissipates energy and that hurts. It's uncomfortable. What we |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=522) |  want is that the concentration practice be a positive feedback loop. The more focused |
    | [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=527) |  you are, the better you feel. If you have these subtle tendencies, or maybe not so subtle |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=534) |  tendencies, to be fighting with the things that aren't inside your focus or in some way |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=542) |  by tensing around them, pushing them down, not wanting them to be there, that makes it |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=547) |  an uncomfortable experience to focus. You're literally fighting with yourself. You have |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=553) |  to be careful and train yourself to focus on what you deem relevant without rejecting |
    | [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-jZE9jDfKQ&t=560) |  all the other stuff. |
