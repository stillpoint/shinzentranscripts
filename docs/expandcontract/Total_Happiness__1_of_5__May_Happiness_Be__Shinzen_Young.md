    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=0) |  You know what mindful awareness is, at least as I say, one person's paradigm. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=23) |  You also know that mindful awareness, concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity are cultivatable |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=30) |  skills. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=31) |  That's an enormous discovery. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=33) |  So that these skills exist is a huge discovery that any human being who wants to, who's willing |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=41) |  to allocate a reasonable amount of time and energy can cultivate these skills. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=47) |  And yes, the cultivatability of these things is utterly extraordinary. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=53) |  And this is the great contribution of Asia to have discovered systematic ways to cultivate |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=61) |  these things. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=62) |  And specifically India, give credit where credit's due. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=67) |  Indian culture developed this like no other culture ever did. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=74) |  Science arose in the West. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=76) |  It's a real Western thing. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=77) |  It now belongs to the whole world. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=79) |  The systematic ways to cultivate concentration, power, sensory clarity, and equanimity arose |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=86) |  in India. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=87) |  Now they belong to the world. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=89) |  That this is cultivatable and cultivatable to whatever extent you need it. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=96) |  This would be the gospel, I would say, of Buddhism. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=100) |  It is gospel meaning the good news. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=103) |  While there's the Christian version of what the good news is, the Buddhist version of |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=107) |  the good news is anybody who really wants concentration, clarity, and equanimity can |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=112) |  have as much of it as they need. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=115) |  If I had to put it in a phrase, if somebody said, why practice mindfulness, I would say |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=122) |  for total happiness. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=127) |  That phrase, total happiness. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=129) |  Which for me is a technical term. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=135) |  It's a technical term. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=137) |  Highly technical term. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=140) |  Now to call it happiness, some people might object that that sounds frivolous. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=148) |  However, in point of fact, the Buddhist greeting in the Pali language, the language that is |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=156) |  closest to the Buddha himself is Sukhihoto, which is usually translated, may you be happy. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=165) |  But actually, if you look at it grammatically, it's not may you be happy, it's may happiness |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=172) |  be. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=173) |  It's a third person singular imperative. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=178) |  May happiness be. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=179) |  Of course, implying to you, but to everyone. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=183) |  It's universal happiness. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=185) |  Enlightenment in the sense of nirvana or nirvana was referred to by the Buddha as Diptadhamma |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=193) |  Sukhavihara. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=194) |  Diptadhamma means in the here and now. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=199) |  Sukha means, in this case, we could translate happy. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=203) |  And vihara means abiding. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=205) |  Abiding in happiness in the here and now was the Buddha's reason to do this practice. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=214) |  What he promised that people were going to have. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=216) |  So it's not ridiculous to define happiness as a technical term and then sort of look |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=223) |  at that. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=225) |  So if you ask the average person, what makes you happy? |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=233) |  What do you mean by happiness? |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=236) |  The first answer you'll probably get is something like this. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=241) |  I'm happy when I get what I want. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=248) |  What they're thinking of primarily is, I'll be happy when I get the conditions that I |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=257) |  want. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=258) |  Objective conditions. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=260) |  Ordinary people, what are the things that they would want to get that would make them |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=265) |  happy? |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=266) |  Security. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=267) |  Security. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=268) |  Sex. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=269) |  Sex. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=270) |  Sex. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=271) |  Sex. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=272) |  Sex. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=273) |  Good sex. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=274) |  Relationships. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=275) |  Health. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=276) |  Health. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=277) |  Good weather. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=278) |  Good weather. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=279) |  Good job. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=280) |  A job. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=281) |  Some people want money. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=282) |  Money. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=283) |  Recognition. |

    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=292) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=293) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=294) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=295) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=296) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=297) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=298) |  Good food. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=299) |  Good food. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=300) |  Food to eat. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=301) |  Water to drink. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=302) |  Air to breathe. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=303) |  Vitality. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=304) |  Strength. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=305) |  We covered it. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=306) |  Probe a little deeper. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=309) |  Well, people are thinking, get objective conditions that I want. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=315) |  Well, I use the word objective conditions. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=318) |  Circumstances. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=319) |  It's not just that we want to get certain things, we also want to avoid certain things. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=324) |  We want to get a good reputation, but we want to avoid being shamed. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=330) |  We want to avoid all the opposites of the good conditions. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=337) |  If you had certain good conditions but couldn't avoid certain other bad conditions, then you |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=344) |  wouldn't be happy. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=345) |  So there's also the notion of get conditions I want and avoid conditions I don't want. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=357) |  For example, I'll be happy when I have a good job and my sister doesn't bug me anymore. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=370) |  If we analyze a little bit more deeply and ask the question, well, how do we even know |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=380) |  what our conditions are? |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=385) |  The only way that we can know what our objective conditions are is through sensory experience. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=393) |  The parts of sensory experience that ordinary people call self are their body experience, |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=404) |  their physical and emotional sensations, and their mind experience, their visual thoughts |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=411) |  and internal conversations, internal talk. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=419) |  Most people would say that I am my body, I am my mind. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=428) |  When we talk about the sensory experience part of happiness, what we get is I'm happy |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=437) |  when I get sensory experiences I want and avoid sensory experiences I don't want in |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=446) |  body, in mind. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=449) |  I have a certain control over my image and talk. |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=452) |  There is what might be called a motor component. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=456) |  Thought is something you do, it's an action, it's a form of karma. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=460) |  But from another perspective, thought can be looked upon as a sensory experience because |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=466) |  thought comes to you through a visual means, which is mental pictures, and an auditory |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=474) |  means, which is internal talk. |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=477) |  In the West, mental experiences are not ordinarily thought of as a sensory experience. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=484) |  But I think it's very important to be able to conceptualize thinking as a tangible sensory |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=494) |  experience. |
    | [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0A6Rw7KnvA&t=495) |  Because what's tangible is trackable, and what's trackable is tractable. |

When we talk about the sensory experience part of happiness, what we get is I'm happy when I get sensory experiences I want and avoid sensory experiences I don't want in body, in mind. I have a certain control over my image and talk. There is what might be called a motor component. Thought is something you do, it's an action, it's a form of karma. But from another perspective, thought can be looked upon as a sensory experience because thought comes to you through a visual means, which is mental pictures, and an auditory means, which is internal talk. In the West, mental experiences are not ordinarily thought of as a sensory experience. But I think it's very important to be able to conceptualize thinking as a tangible sensory experience. Because what's tangible is trackable, and what's trackable is tractable.
