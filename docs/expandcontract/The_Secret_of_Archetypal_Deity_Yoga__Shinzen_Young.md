    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=0) |  By the time Mahayana evolved into Vajrayana, the religious stuff was really intense. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=13) |  So now the Buddha is a deity. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=16) |  And to become a Buddha means to become a deity. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=19) |  So how is that feasible? |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=21) |  Well, what they did is they did something very, very clever. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=27) |  They showed people how they could become a deity, a god. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=33) |  It's called deity yoga. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=37) |  Yoga in the sense of merging, by the way. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=40) |  Hlei Nenjor in the Tibetan language. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=43) |  Now you've probably heard that Tibetan Buddhism is secret Buddhism. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=48) |  They're the secret initiations. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=52) |  So now I'm going to give away the secret to all of you. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=55) |  Yes, that's right. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=58) |  Here's the secret of secret Buddhism. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=61) |  How do you become a deity? |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=65) |  In a way that is not insanity or possession, by the way. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=71) |  How do you become a deity in a way that brings about the same insight and liberation as the |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=77) |  deconstructive process of early Buddhism? |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=81) |  Very clever. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=82) |  Here's how you do it. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=86) |  You replace your internal talk with the mantra of the deity. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=92) |  You replace your self image with the image of the deity. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=97) |  And you replace your normal human feelings with the feel of the deity. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=102) |  And you form the touch of the deity by making hand gestures, mudras. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=108) |  So touch, feel, image, talk of a myth, you become the myth. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=117) |  As I say, not to be insane and not to be possessed, but to gain insight into what? |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=126) |  Insight into the arbitrary nature of self-identification. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=130) |  Because you created this alternate identity from scratch. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=134) |  And you know it's a myth. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=137) |  But you become it. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=139) |  Very clever. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=140) |  It was a way of meeting the people where they were at. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=142) |  They were worshipping these archetypes. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=147) |  Buddhism had really moved from its early sort of Buddha is a spiritual scientist, just another |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=153) |  guy, but an extraordinary guy, to, okay, Buddha is an archetype, so now become the archetype |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=162) |  and you'll get the same insight into how the sense of self arises. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=167) |  So once again, we're working with feel, image, talk, aren't we? |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=172) |  Broadly, it's another way to do focus on positive, as I define focus on positive. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=181) |  So in Tibetan Buddhism, in the core of these, if you look at the surface, it looks like |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=186) |  they're doing these rituals. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=187) |  But inside they're doing deity yoga, where they're becoming this deity, then becoming |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=192) |  this other deity, then becoming this other deity. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=196) |  In order to see that when you work with those elements, those are the elements that create |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=201) |  the illusion of self. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=203) |  If it can create the illusion of a mythical self, then it certainly can create the illusion |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=207) |  of your ordinary self, and you gain the same insights. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=211) |  So one of the reasons that I define focus on positive so broadly is to allow some students |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=220) |  who wish to, to do deity yoga. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=223) |  Some of my students that relate to that, I would never encourage a person to do this, |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=228) |  but some of them want to do it, and it can be very insightful. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=231) |  Well, the focus on positive technique that I give you is so broadly defined that it includes |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=237) |  within it not only early Buddhist loving kindness, but deity yoga, because you're working with |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=243) |  those elements in a very systematic way. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=246) |  A lot of times, Westerners, if they want to do this, will not choose the deities of India |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=255) |  and Tibet. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=257) |  They'll choose Western archetypes. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=260) |  That's certainly my case. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=262) |  When I do this, I typically use La Virgen de Guadalupe, the Virgin of Guadalupe, because |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=271) |  I grew up seeing that in LA. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=274) |  And that's very natural for me. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=277) |  And I use Ave Maria. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=278) |  Yeah, so you got the little Jewish boy from LA does the Catholic tantric practice. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=286) |  Well, that's the world we live in. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=292) |  But it works. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=293) |  You can do it with any archetype. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=297) |  And in fact, traditional way that you're supposed to be taught to do the rosary is you visualize |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=306) |  the mystery, you have the certain prayer and talk space, and you're supposed to experience |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=310) |  the emotions, and you're touch-wise engaged with the rosary. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=314) |  It's the same elements. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WtPrOE1JSk&t=316) |  It's right there. |
