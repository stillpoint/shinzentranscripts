    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=0) |  As you know, I like to have people be sensitive to the fact that certain body sensations are |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=13) |  emotional in origin. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=16) |  And I have a hypothesis that when people are noting those emotional feels, that in fact |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=28) |  what's happening in the central nervous system is activation in what's called the limbic |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=34) |  system and that there is a distinct neuronal apparatus that underlies the emotional type |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=45) |  sensations in the body. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=47) |  And emotional sensations in the body are hugely important in my way of thinking in terms of |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=55) |  their influence on human perception and behavior. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=62) |  So as people work with this category of the emotional body or feel space, as I call it, |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=73) |  you might think, well, as the result of meditating as the years go on, things get sort of mellowed |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=81) |  out, cooled out, that kind of thing. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=85) |  But actually what happens typically is that you get strange changes that are sort of weird |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=96) |  for people. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=98) |  And they take the form of things that would really, really, really bother anyone, like |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=109) |  don't bother you or not much. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=113) |  But the flip side is that little things can cause these huge explosions of somatic emotionality. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=127) |  And you wonder, it's like, what's wrong with me? |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=130) |  What's like sort of happening to me? |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=133) |  So what I tell people is if you work with the emotional body, one thing that you can |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=139) |  expect is that things will change. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=143) |  But you can't predict what direction that change will take in terms of are things going |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=151) |  to be more mellow, more intense, are the flavors that come up going to be more appropriate |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=159) |  or inappropriate? |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=160) |  They seem to go through wild fluctuations. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=164) |  And it's important not to freak out when this happens and wonder what in the world |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=170) |  is going on. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=173) |  I would say there are some things that we can say are long-term trends. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=181) |  Absolutely, definitely long-term trend. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=187) |  Emotional sensations are going to become less problematic for you. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=192) |  And absolutely, long-term trend, pleasant emotional sensations are going to become more |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=199) |  fulfilling for you. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=202) |  However, in terms of local fluctuations, don't be surprised if there's some really weird, |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=212) |  chaotic kinds of things. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=216) |  What to do if that happens is simply recycle the reactions. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=228) |  The model that I like to use is that we have within us this freaked out infant animal deep |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=243) |  down within. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=247) |  As we meditate, we develop another self, which could be called the meditator self or the |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=254) |  concentrated clear equanimous self or the witness. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=259) |  And at a certain extreme, we'll call that the no self or the higher self. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=269) |  So what happens is that this super adult part of us shines its attention on the freaked out |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=281) |  infantile animal part that remains and integrates or we could say even metabolizes, or if we |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=295) |  wanted to be a little more poetic, we can say eats up, literally nibbles away at the |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=306) |  freaking animal infant within. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=310) |  And as this higher self or no self or meditator self, as it's sort of like nibbling away at |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=321) |  this freaked out infant animal, it's deriving nutrition from that. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=328) |  It's growing, which is good. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=334) |  And the freaked out animal infant is shrinking, which is also good. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=342) |  But as it shrinks, it drops to even more primitive levels. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=352) |  And that's why you get this weird sort of like, oh my God, what do I have inside of |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=357) |  me kind of thing. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=358) |  So it's actually a sign of progress. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=362) |  The surface of the freaked out animal infant, it's like getting integrated. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=369) |  It's energy, what the energy bound up in it is going into the super adult. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=376) |  That's good. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=377) |  But you sort of like nibble away a layer. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=382) |  So it shrinks, it's smaller. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=385) |  In a sense, its influence over you is diminished, but it exposes a more primitive stratum. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=393) |  And so it goes until you sort of work your way through this aspect, which might take |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=405) |  a while. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=406) |  So as you get closer and closer and closer to becoming completely free, you're now exposing |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=413) |  more and more and more chaotic, intense levels of pure body emotion. |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=425) |  So this model helps me to have a conceptual framework for why it sometimes seems that |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=441) |  genius idiosyncrasies of a person are sins crying out to heaven for vengeance or why |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=453) |  someone can insult me with all kinds of lies on the internet. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=457) |  And I don't even give it a second thought. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=460) |  But if somebody cuts me off in traffic, it's like, that's huge. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=465) |  It's like, I'm going to kill them. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=469) |  It's like, it's like, so it's like weird. |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=478) |  That seems to just be the way it works. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=482) |  I just wanted to share that for those of you that are wondering if you're on the way to |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=486) |  the booby hatch. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=488) |  No, you're on the way to the source. |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=494) |  But as they say, membership has its price. |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=498) |  So you're joining the club. |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=500) |  Many, many, many human beings have taken this path. |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvcGvR_gnBE&t=506) |  So welcome to the club. |
