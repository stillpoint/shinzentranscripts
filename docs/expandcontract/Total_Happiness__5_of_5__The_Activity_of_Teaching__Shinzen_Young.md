    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=0) |  The activity of fostering extraordinary happiness in others I call teaching. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=14) |  Just by the fact that you do this practice, you are already a teacher in my very broad |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=20) |  formulation. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=22) |  Because I distinguish three levels of teaching. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=27) |  The first level of teaching I call subtle teaching. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=30) |  As the result of doing this practice, we change. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=33) |  Particularly people who have known us notice it. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=37) |  But as it gets stronger and stronger as the months, years, and decades go on, everybody |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=44) |  notices it. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=46) |  If only at some subtle subliminal level, just where you're coming from has this impact on |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=53) |  people. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=55) |  That's a huge sermon to the world. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=58) |  So everyone that practices from the absolute beginner to the master who can look at you |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=67) |  and put you in a trance, teaches at the subtle level. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=72) |  Then the next level of teaching I call the explanatory level. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=77) |  Somebody asks you a question about what you do and you can give a coherent description |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=86) |  of what you do. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=87) |  Sandiptiko dhammo. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=89) |  That means that the dharma is crystal clear. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=93) |  Somebody hearing a clear description, a model of this practice may think, ooh, that sounds |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=100) |  desirable. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=101) |  Even if you're not trying to convince them it is desirable. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=105) |  Just you being able in words to coherently describe what you do, I call that the descriptive |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=112) |  level of teaching. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=113) |  The explicit level of teaching, you're saying, hey, I'm going to teach you techniques, I'm |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=117) |  going to teach you concepts, I'm going to show you how to apply this in your life in |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=122) |  specific if you have questions or you need encouragement, come see me and we're going |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=127) |  to have a sequence of lessons or I'm going to be giving a sitting group that you can |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=134) |  join and you can talk to me about your practice. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=137) |  I'm running retreats. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=139) |  You're explicitly now a teacher. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=143) |  I like to distinguish within the explicit teachers certain special subcategories of |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=150) |  explicit teachers. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=153) |  First there's the paraprofessional. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=155) |  A number of you are paraprofessionals. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=158) |  At a retreat you can do all the explicit teaching that I just mentioned. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=162) |  You put out your name to be a facilitator. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=166) |  So that would be a paraprofessional. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=169) |  Professional means you're a full-time. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=171) |  You live perhaps by alms, Dana in other words. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=177) |  The Christian term is alms. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=180) |  Or you have a different fee structure but you're a professional. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=187) |  That's what you do. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=189) |  There's a certain subclass of professionals that are capable of confidently and competently |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=198) |  dealing with the issue of classical enlightenment. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=202) |  Particularly can deal with that issue if a person happens to have a sudden enlightenment |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=207) |  experience. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=208) |  You have to know what to say in those cases. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=211) |  Not every professional teacher can or for that matter is required to be able to deal |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=219) |  with that issue. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=220) |  At least not in the Vipassana tradition. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=223) |  Zen is maybe a little different story. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=227) |  There is a watershed between teachers that can lead you to enlightenment by teaching |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=232) |  you and teachers that can really deal with the issue of what happens if somebody does |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=237) |  get enlightenment. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=239) |  That's a whole other, from my perspective, that's a special skill. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=246) |  Also to deal with what very occasionally happens. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=251) |  Doesn't happen often. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=252) |  It's only happened a few times in my many decades career. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=256) |  But there can sometimes be a thing where people get a sort of enlightenment experience that |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=262) |  has a mixture of pathology with it. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=268) |  It's straddles enlightenment and a condition called DPDR, derealization depersonalization |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=275) |  disorder. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=277) |  This special class of teachers can deal with that issue too if it should come up. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=284) |  So let's just call them masters for now for lack of any other term. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=291) |  Among masters there is a very, very, very special class of master. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=299) |  That's a Buddha. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=301) |  Because it was asked, well what's the difference between a Buddha and an arhat? |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=306) |  Arhat's fully enlightened, fully purified. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=309) |  What makes a certain arhat a Buddha? |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=314) |  The answer is where there was no path, he discovered a path and made it available to |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=324) |  the world. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=326) |  That's the traditional formulation. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=328) |  I'd modify that a little bit. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=331) |  I would say a single Buddha is a master who discovers something new and important about |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=343) |  enlightenment. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=345) |  As a result of that, there is widespread and profound positive change in the direction |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=354) |  of human history. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=356) |  Not just change the course of a few lives in a good way. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=361) |  That's a Buddha. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=362) |  I'm not at all sure that the next Buddha will be one person. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=368) |  The next Buddha may be a team, a team of enlightened scientists, for example. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=375) |  If we think of Buddha as meaning discover something that has not been known in the past |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=380) |  and that is deep enough and powerful enough to change the course of human history, that |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=386) |  might turn out to be a team effort. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=389) |  Might, who can say? |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=392) |  This then gives us a map of total happiness. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=397) |  This is where we started. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=400) |  Ordinary happiness for yourself. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=405) |  Then we talked about extraordinary happiness for yourself. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=413) |  Then we talked about how these lead to service to others, ordinary happiness for others, |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=425) |  and extraordinary happiness for others. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=428) |  Under extraordinary happiness for others, I mentioned teaching. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=432) |  There's one other category and that is supporting teaching. |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=439) |  That's Dana, right? |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=440) |  The Dana, the teacher Dana. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=442) |  When you support teachers, you support their efforts to bring extraordinary happiness to |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=448) |  others. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=450) |  So that then gives us, I don't know if you can see this from where you are, but this |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=458) |  is the details filled in. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=488) |  So, now we know at least two things. |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=518) |  One, we know that mindfulness is cultivatable to any degree. |
    | [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=530) |  We also now have an idea of a lot of very wonderful things that can result from mindful |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=539) |  awareness. |
    | [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_24Qy77Rko&t=540) |  Things that mindful awareness fosters, looked upon under the simple concept of total happiness. |

     The activity of fostering extraordinary happiness in others I call teaching. Just by the fact that you do this practice, you are already a teacher in my very broad formulation. Because I distinguish three levels of teaching. The first level of teaching I call subtle teaching. As the result of doing this practice, we change. Particularly people who have known us notice it. But as it gets stronger and stronger as the months, years, and decades go on, everybody notices it. If only at some subtle subliminal level, just where you're coming from has this impact on people. That's a huge sermon to the world. So everyone that practices from the absolute beginner to the master who can look at you and put you in a trance, teaches at the subtle level. Then the next level of teaching I call the explanatory level. Somebody asks you a question about what you do and you can give a coherent description of what you do. Sandiptiko dhammo. That means that the dharma is crystal clear. Somebody hearing a clear description, a model of this practice may think, ooh, that sounds desirable. Even if you're not trying to convince them it is desirable. Just you being able in words to coherently describe what you do, I call that the descriptive level of teaching. The explicit level of teaching, you're saying, hey, I'm going to teach you techniques, I'm going to teach you concepts, I'm going to show you how to apply this in your life in specific if you have questions or you need encouragement, come see me and we're going to have a sequence of lessons or I'm going to be giving a sitting group that you can join and you can talk to me about your practice. I'm running retreats. You're explicitly now a teacher. I like to distinguish within the explicit teachers certain special subcategories of explicit teachers. First there's the paraprofessional. A number of you are paraprofessionals. At a retreat you can do all the explicit teaching that I just mentioned. You put out your name to be a facilitator. So that would be a paraprofessional. Professional means you're a full-time. You live perhaps by alms, Dana in other words. The Christian term is alms. Or you have a different fee structure but you're a professional. That's what you do. There's a certain subclass of professionals that are capable of confidently and competently dealing with the issue of classical enlightenment. Particularly can deal with that issue if a person happens to have a sudden enlightenment experience. You have to know what to say in those cases. Not every professional teacher can or for that matter is required to be able to deal with that issue. At least not in the Vipassana tradition. Zen is maybe a little different story.
