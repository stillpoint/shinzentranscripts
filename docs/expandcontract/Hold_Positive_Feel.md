    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=0) |  Hi, my name's Kathleen and I've been meditating with Shinsen for almost 10 years. |
    | [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=6) |  And I recently had a situation in my life that really threw me off course. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=25) |  My brother went into the hospital, he was taken to the emergency room and we were told |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=34) |  that his body had begun the dying process. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=41) |  Now he is a very young man and for us to be told that, it was really scary. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=49) |  We were told that his liver had gone into liver failure and that if his body did not |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=55) |  start to show any signs of healing in the next 12 to 24 hours, he was going to go to |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=65) |  the number one spot on the emergency liver transplant list in the entire southeast part |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=71) |  of the United States. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=74) |  This shocked us. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=75) |  We're like, oh my goodness. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=76) |  Yesterday he was bee-bopping around the world and now he might die. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=81) |  So our family stayed there the entire day and into the night. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=84) |  But then I said to the family, I said, please, everyone go home, get a good night's sleep. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=91) |  He was unconscious. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=92) |  I said, get a good night's sleep. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=94) |  I will stay here and be with him tonight just in case he wakes up. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=99) |  They went home and what they didn't know is that I have this technique of holding positive |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=108) |  states for a loved one. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=114) |  I decided to do a yaza, which is where you stay up all night long and you focus, for |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=121) |  myself I decided to focus on these positive states. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=126) |  So I sat by his bedside and because of the situation I had a lot of feeling inside of |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=134) |  me of love towards him. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=137) |  So at first I sat there and I radiated love towards him. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=140) |  I just sat there and I just focused on the love going out to him. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=144) |  I'm looking at him laying in a bed. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=146) |  I focused on the love going towards him. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=150) |  After a period of time, I couldn't feel the love inside my body. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=159) |  So then I started focusing on wonderful memories that we had had. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=166) |  I remember great times we had growing up and I would focus on that memory and then the |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=171) |  love and the feeling would just radiate out of me towards him. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=176) |  I sat there for hours and felt so much love and gratitude for him in my life. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=185) |  About 2, 3 o'clock in the morning, the love kind of went away because of the exhaustion. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=192) |  I started to have talk of, you know, just, oh I'm tired, I want to sleep. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=198) |  But then by focusing on that talk and then changing that to love. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=206) |  Instead of going down the road of the negative talk, I focused on positive talk. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=214) |  I would just sit there and I would just say love and I'd feel the love going out to him. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=219) |  I'd go love, I love you so much. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=222) |  I mean, I would just, any loving thought or talk that I could say in my head to radiate |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=228) |  towards my brother, that's what I did. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=232) |  You know, I live my life that I try to love people day to day and I try to be there for |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=238) |  them and I try to cherish them. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=242) |  But I've never experienced a love that deep when I am in such a vulnerable state and he's |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=249) |  in such a vulnerable state that to feel that love radiating towards him hour after hour. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=261) |  It was a great gift that he gave to me that night for me by using the whole positive interstates. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=277) |  It truly changed the way I feel about my brother. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=281) |  I have so much love and compassion in my heart for him and I feel like I love him on so much |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=288) |  of a deeper level now. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=294) |  And I am just so grateful for him and for the love and for the time that we have shared. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=303) |  He has had a full recovery and I am so grateful for that. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=308) |  I know that without that technique I would have gone to the hospital, I would have suffered, |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=314) |  I would have heard all the negative stuff that was happening. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=318) |  I would have heard he was going to die for this reason or that reason. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=322) |  I would have heard all of that negative stuff and I would have freaked out. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=326) |  I would have been in a panic state. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=329) |  I would not have been able to focus. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=332) |  I would have been so consumed with all the negativity of the situation that I just would |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=340) |  have been in a huge ball of suffering. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=343) |  Because of this technique it turned a terrible negative situation in my life into a deepening |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=351) |  of love for my brother. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNZRKbFlsaY&t=355) |  I am forever grateful for this technique. |
