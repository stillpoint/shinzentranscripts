    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=0) |  Most people, if they're going to get caught someplace, that's going to prevent them from |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=19) |  becoming enlightened. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=21) |  It's going to be in allocating so much time and energy to finding the right map, the right |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=30) |  model, the right teacher, the right situation, that there's little time and energy left to |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=37) |  actually do the practice. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=40) |  So we might call that the map trap. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=48) |  The second trap, speaking broadly about the spiritual path, is what we might call the |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=57) |  fundamentalism trap. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=59) |  You buy into a mythological system that allows you to make dramatic and significant improvements |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=71) |  in both your happiness subjectively and your behavior objectively. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=78) |  Even small positive changes in a person's life in terms of being happier subjectively |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=84) |  and behaving better objectively, that's what I mean by positive changes, even small positive |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=90) |  changes in a person's life are very, very difficult to come by. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=96) |  Ask any psychotherapist. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=99) |  To have huge positive changes in a person's life quickly, dramatically, that's not a small |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=107) |  thing. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=109) |  Something really good happens. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=112) |  The problem is your intellectual horizons have now become closed. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=118) |  The very mythological structure that allowed for these positive changes prevents the next |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=128) |  stage in positive change. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=130) |  The antidote for not getting caught in a good place for the fundamentalist is to realize |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=137) |  what I just said, if they can. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=145) |  Let's say that you do a meditation practice. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=148) |  You can achieve states of calm and concentration, and that's certainly a good thing. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=159) |  But year after year after year, that's sort of where you're at. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=163) |  You sit down, everything is sort of tranquil, time passes quickly, you get up, you're refreshed, |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=172) |  but that's about it. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=173) |  Well, that's a good place, but you can go beyond that to a better place. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=180) |  So we might call that the tranquility trap. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=182) |  The antidote for that particular getting caught in a good place is you take these blissful, |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=190) |  tranquil states and then you clarify them. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=193) |  By distinguishing different flavors of restfulness, that brings a clarification component into |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=202) |  the tranquility piece. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=208) |  You think that you're going closer and closer to the source by exploring the world of archetypes, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=214) |  special powers, body experiences, former lives, you name it. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=222) |  It can be a good place, but it can also limit you. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=227) |  You think you're making spiritual progress, going deeper and deeper and deeper towards |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=233) |  the formless source, but actually you've turned 90 degrees, you're now on a trajectory that's |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=238) |  at right angles to going down to the source of consciousness, but you don't know it. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=243) |  You're going out, out, out, exploring the power realms. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=249) |  If you deconstruct the realm of spirits mindfully, it will take you to spirit, and that's the |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=255) |  antidote to the realms of power trap. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=258) |  You interpret the experience of the power realms as a sensory event, just like any other |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=263) |  sensory event, power or bizarre, you treat it as though it were banal, and you apply |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=269) |  concentration, clarity, and equanimity to it, as you would with any other sensory event. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=275) |  That then allows you to go deeper and deeper and deeper towards not the realm of spirits, |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=282) |  but the realm of the great spirit, shall we say, that formless doing, the dharmakaya. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=293) |  It can happen that you get classical enlightenment. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=296) |  It's the real thing. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=297) |  It's permanent, you've seen the no-self, but you think you know more than you do, and you |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=304) |  might even start teaching from that place. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=308) |  That's another good place you can get caught in. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=312) |  Enlightenment is a many-faceted jewel. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=315) |  You can see it from many, many sides. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=317) |  In my experience, it's a continuum, a vast continuum, with many facets. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=324) |  A person could easily miss some of those facets. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=329) |  Just because you've seen the no-self doesn't mean you don't have a long, long way to go |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=338) |  to become truly liberated from your old habits. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=343) |  What shall we call it? |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=345) |  The enlightenment trap. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=348) |  Well, the antidote to that is the courage to take feedback from other teachers, and |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=358) |  to find teachers vastly senior to yourself, to take feedback from them. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=365) |  Constantly take feedback from your environment. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=368) |  One of my teachers used to say, Kyō no satori wa ashita no machigai. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=373) |  You may know satori. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=374) |  It's the Japanese for awakening. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=376) |  Today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake, meaning you have to be constantly willing |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=384) |  to move forward. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=390) |  The observer trap is the characteristic weakness in the mindfulness way of working. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=395) |  Now, that doesn't mean that it's a showstopper. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=400) |  It just means when you work within that way, you have to be aware that this could be a |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=405) |  problem and you have to be aware of what the antidote is, what the fix is. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=412) |  Two parts to the fix. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=413) |  The first is to bear in mind what I just said, that there is this possible danger. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=419) |  If you're not aware of this possible danger, then you might fall into that trap. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=427) |  You know that this could be a possible danger. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=429) |  Well, then how do we not have that happen? |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=434) |  Well, think about when you learn to drive a car, assuming you have learned to drive |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=440) |  a car. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=442) |  When you first attempt to do it, I remember when I first learned to drive a car, I was |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=447) |  on a stick shift and it took so much effort and I had to think about everything. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=457) |  I could just barely do it. |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=459) |  I thought to myself, I'll never be able to operate this car and do anything else. |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=467) |  I'll just have to be constantly thinking about the two dozen things I have to be constantly |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=472) |  thinking about. |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=474) |  But you know what? |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=475) |  After six months, I'm just bopping along on the freeways in LA, listening to the radio, |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=483) |  munching on a burrito, talking to somebody, and it's rush hour traffic, it's smog, it's |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=491) |  chaos and no problem. |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=496) |  What happened? |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=498) |  The fact of having driven so much was driving the car. |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=505) |  In other words, the driving became second nature. |
    | [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=509) |  First practice develops concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=516) |  At first, you have to think about it and it takes a lot of effort. |
    | [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=521) |  At some point, the concentration, clarity, and equanimity start to go on autopilot. |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=528) |  Then the subtle mental images, subtle internal conversations, and subtle emotional sensations |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=539) |  in the body that create the sense that there is someone meditating, that there is a self |
    | [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=548) |  directing this process. |
    | [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=551) |  Those sensory arisings start to get enfolded within the momentum of the concentration, |
    | [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=559) |  clarity, and equanimity without the need for more of them to be directing the process. |
    | [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=567) |  In other words, just as with the driving metaphor, the habit of driving eventually can drive |
    | [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=574) |  the car. |
    | [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=575) |  So in the mindfulness metaphor, the habit of mindfulness eventually meditates you and |
    | [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=583) |  seeps around and dissolves the sense of a meditator. |
    | [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i288Lnb7NOk&t=588) |  And that's how it works. |

=== "Text"
     Most people, if they're going to get caught someplace, that's going to prevent them from becoming enlightened. It's going to be in allocating so much time and energy to finding the right map, the right model, the right teacher, the right situation, that there's little time and energy left to actually do the practice. So we might call that the map trap. The second trap, speaking broadly about the spiritual path, is what we might call the fundamentalism trap. You buy into a mythological system that allows you to make dramatic and significant improvements in both your happiness subjectively and your behavior objectively. Even small positive changes in a person's life in terms of being happier subjectively and behaving better objectively, that's what I mean by positive changes, even small positive changes in a person's life are very, very difficult to come by. Ask any psychotherapist. To have huge positive changes in a person's life quickly, dramatically, that's not a small thing. Something really good happens. The problem is your intellectual horizons have now become closed. The very mythological structure that allowed for these positive changes prevents the next stage in positive change. The antidote for not getting caught in a good place for the fundamentalist is to realize what I just said, if they can. Let's say that you do a meditation practice. You can achieve states of calm and concentration, and that's certainly a good thing. But year after year after year, that's sort of where you're at. You sit down, everything is sort of tranquil, time passes quickly, you get up, you're refreshed, but that's about it. Well, that's a good place, but you can go beyond that to a better place. So we might call that the tranquility trap. The antidote for that particular getting caught in a good place is you take these blissful, tranquil states and then you clarify them. By distinguishing different flavors of restfulness, that brings a clarification component into the tranquility piece. You think that you're going closer and closer to the source by exploring the world of archetypes, special powers, body experiences, former lives, you name it. It can be a good place, but it can also limit you. You think you're making spiritual progress, going deeper and deeper and deeper towards the formless source, but actually you've turned 90 degrees, you're now on a trajectory that's at right angles to going down to the source of consciousness, but you don't know it. You're going out, out, out, exploring the power realms. If you deconstruct the realm of spirits mindfully, it will take you to spirit, and that's the antidote to the realms of power trap. You interpret the experience of the power realms as a sensory event, just like any other sensory event, power or bizarre, you treat it as though it were banal, and you apply concentration, clarity, and equanimity to it, as you would with any other sensory event. That then allows you to go deeper and deeper and deeper towards not the realm of spirits, but the realm of the great spirit, shall we say, that formless doing, the dharmakaya. It can happen that you get classical enlightenment. It's the real thing. It's permanent, you've seen the no-self, but you think you know more than you do, and you might even start teaching from that place. That's another good place you can get caught in. Enlightenment is a many-faceted jewel. You can see it from many, many sides. In my experience, it's a continuum, a vast continuum, with many facets. A person could easily miss some of those facets.
