    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=7) |  Forget about the instant level, we're not even at room temperature. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=15) |  It is certainly historically the case that the custom of drinking tea was introduced from China into Japan in association with Zen. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=34) |  It was the Song Dynasty style of making tea, which is the powdered tea that's in with the matcha in the Japanese pronunciation. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=48) |  That came in with the initial introduction of Zen at that same period that I was talking about in Japan in the 12th, 13th century and so forth. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=59) |  However, China had had tea prior to that, and I don't know to what extent it was drunk in Japan. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=67) |  I mean, everybody says it came in the Kamakura period with Zen from China. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=74) |  But tea goes back at least as far as the Tang Dynasty. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=78) |  But in the Tang Dynasty, they made it into bricks. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=81) |  It's like a brick, and I guess you pull it apart like the bole, the chao bing. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=90) |  They're very expensive. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=93) |  They come from, actually not too far from where Philip's ancestors come from, in South China. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=100) |  I've had those, and somebody will tell you that this is like $2,000 in bole, brick tea. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=112) |  But then later on in the Ming Dynasty, they started to steep the leaves, and that's called sencha. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=123) |  That was introduced into Japan also by a school of Zen, the Obaku school of Zen, that came in at the transition between the Ming and Qing Dynasties, |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=133) |  the early Tokugawa period. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=135) |  So there's been like three different ways that tea was made, brick, powdered, and then just leaf, which is the modern way. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=145) |  And two of those ways were introduced by different streams of Zen that came into Japan. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=159) |  There's no problem with the stimulant if the choice is the Zen lurch and the keisaku beating. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=167) |  So the alternative is, well, a little stimulant. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=176) |  Now in fact, sometimes business magazines like Fast Company and whatever, they do stories on Green Mountain Mindfulness program, |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=188) |  my program, and the slant they always use is, isn't this weird? A coffee company is teaching tranquility, how strange is that kind of thing? |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=197) |  When I think of meditation, yeah, there's a tranquility component, but there's also a clarity alertness component. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=206) |  And then some people get jangly if they drink stimulants, so of course that's not good in that case. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=214) |  But that doesn't seem to happen to me, so it works out. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=224) |  I've never closely researched the history, but I've heard sort of anecdotally that coffee fulfilled the same role in the Islamic Sufi meditative tradition |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=238) |  as the matcha did for the Zen, but I'd have to look that up and see if that's really true. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZudmkA4iEM&t=245) |  Okay, let's do it. |
