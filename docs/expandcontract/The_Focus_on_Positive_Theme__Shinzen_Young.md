    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=0) |  Instead of just observing the subjective system of field image talk, we've been intentionally |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=11) |  finding, creating, holding, and even radiating what I call positive states. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=21) |  So sometimes in the process of just observing, it might happen to you that you get a mental |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=30) |  picture that has a deep positive significance for you. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=36) |  It might happen. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=39) |  Native people value this very much and actually go through various physical ordeals of fasting |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=45) |  and other ceremonies in order to get those deep sort of directional images. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=55) |  And anthropologists call it a vision quest, although native people just call it fasting. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=62) |  If an Indian says, I've been fasting, they probably mean I just spent four days without |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=69) |  any food or any water alone on a hill crying for a vision. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=75) |  So it could happen as you're just in the course of practice that a particularly powerful image |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=85) |  comes up, or you could intentionally create it. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=91) |  So if it comes up spontaneously, you can just note it if you're doing focus in and not treat |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=97) |  it in any way special. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=98) |  Or you can decide, hey, this is significant. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=101) |  I'm going to try to hold it, intentionally go with it. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=105) |  And that becomes a focus on a positive image. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=108) |  Analogously, it could happen just spontaneously that a wisdom word or phrase, something that |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=117) |  encapsulates a certain good direction, psychologically, behaviorally, or spiritually for you, something |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=127) |  comes up in the talk space. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=129) |  And you might want to just observe it, or you might want to hold on to it. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=135) |  So then you could shift to a focus on positive. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=138) |  But it's also possible to intentionally create those kinds of words, phrases, and sentences |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=144) |  if you wish. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=146) |  Positive feel is a special case, I would say, of feel in general. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=158) |  And it's feel that typically is pleasant, although you can have compassion type feels |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=164) |  that are sort of sad but in a compassionate way, et cetera. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=170) |  Quite how one would classify that, I'm not sure. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=173) |  But usually, the positive feels are pleasant. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=177) |  They're associated with a positive direction in your behavior or positive aspirations for |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=184) |  others. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=185) |  But I also count positive feel as pleasant sensations associated with being in highly |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=194) |  concentrated states, pleasant sensations associated with the presence of flow, restful states, |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=204) |  or just an intrinsic joy for no reason whatsoever. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=209) |  Ahe Tukananda in Sanskrit is joy that's just our birthright and doesn't have to have a |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=217) |  reason. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=219) |  This would be a range of things that we could call positive feel. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=223) |  And they could come up, once again, spontaneously as we're just observing things. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=230) |  Or we can sort of look for it, create it, attempt to hold it. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=236) |  And when you look for it, when you decide to hold it, if it's come up spontaneously, |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=243) |  or you intentionally look for it, create it, and then hold it, that's an approach called |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=250) |  focus on positive. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=258) |  When you have things that fall under the category of positive come up spontaneously, then you |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=265) |  sort of have a choice of whether to deal with the matter of factly, whether to go for a |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=272) |  focus on positive, which is sort of a formal structure where you hold, repeat, and so forth, |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=279) |  or whether to go into just discursive thinking. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=283) |  And like, okay, I'm going to explore this and think about this in the normal way that |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=288) |  I think about things, because this seems like nature is opening an insight door or some |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=295) |  window, and I would like to pursue it discursively. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=299) |  So essentially, if something unusually positive comes up visually, auditorially, or somatically |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=308) |  in the subjective domain as you're practicing, I would say you have three choices. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=315) |  And sorry to give you so many choices, but they're all good. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=320) |  The basic thing about not being freaked out by choices is to realize all the choices are |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=326) |  good. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=327) |  You're not going to miss out no matter which one you take. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=331) |  So one choice is you're just going to deconstruct it. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=336) |  There's a famous story about the Zen monk is meditating, and the gods are so impressed |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=344) |  by his practice that they come and give flowers every day. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=350) |  This goes on for a couple weeks, and finally, one day, he just takes out the kesaku and |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=358) |  beats the crap out of all the gods and says, get the hell out of here. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=362) |  Well, it's a metaphor for being matter of fact no matter what comes up, even if the |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=369) |  gods give you flowers and bathe you and whatever, seemingly, that's just field image talk. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=377) |  So even if very impactful things come up, you might decide to simply, that's just field |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=386) |  image talk. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=388) |  That's one decision, and then you would be penetrating them, but in the same way that |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=392) |  you would penetrate any sensory event. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=394) |  Alternatively, okay, let's go to hold positive. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=398) |  It's a formal technique. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=400) |  I'm going to repeat that talk as a mantra. |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=402) |  I'm going to try to maintain that image. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=405) |  I'm going to try to maintain that field or some combination of those three, a pair or |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=411) |  all three at once. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=413) |  So then you go to focus on positive. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=415) |  Third possibility, oh, nature seems to be presenting me with an insight window here. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=423) |  I need to think about this, and you start thinking. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=427) |  Notice that I go nowhere without a notepad. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=432) |  When insights come, I will often go into discursive thought, and I will write things down, et |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=441) |  cetera, et cetera. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=442) |  Now, I know I'm suspending the formal practice in order to think in the normal way because |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=449) |  I have to think in the normal way to pursue that insight, and it's certainly okay to do |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=454) |  that on occasion. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=456) |  What we want to avoid is a meditation that is only discursive thought because that's |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88au4ZberSI&t=463) |  not really meditation, but it's certainly okay to do that when it seems appropriate. |
