    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=0) |  We can't always have enough concentration, clarity, and equanimity to have a complete |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=21) |  experience of something. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=25) |  But maybe we can have a little bit of concentration, or a little bit of clarity, or a little bit |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=32) |  of equanimity, and that's not too shabby. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=36) |  Maybe we can't have any concentration, clarity, and equanimity at all under certain circumstances, |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=43) |  but we can have equanimity with that. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=46) |  We can accept that that's the case, and we can continue to do formal practice despite |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=55) |  the fact that we have essentially no concentration, no clarity, and no equanimity. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=61) |  However, we're still setting the stage for nature to do its job. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=67) |  We're catalyzing a natural process. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=70) |  We're giving nature what it needs. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=72) |  On the surface, it seems like we're wasting our time doing a formal practice because it's |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=78) |  like total monkey mind, total confusion mind, total lost in emotional chaos, sleepy, aches |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=90) |  and pains. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=92) |  It seems like we're wasting our time. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=96) |  However, deep down, slowly, changes are taking place even under those circumstances because |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=105) |  we're giving nature a chance. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=107) |  If you have a lot of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, great, you can explore the |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=110) |  possibility of complete experience. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=114) |  If you can't have concentration or clarity, maybe you can have some equanimity. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=119) |  If you see what I'm saying, there's always a way to look at it positively. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=124) |  If you can't have all three, try to have one or two. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=127) |  If you can't have any at all, keep doing the formal practice because that's still doing |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=135) |  some good in the long term. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=138) |  You can always do what seems like going through the motions. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=142) |  It's still better than just completely acquiescing to desperate and hopeless wretchedness of |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=151) |  human condition. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=153) |  However, on occasion, and certainly with practice, given enough time, enough time might be a |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=162) |  lot of time, folks. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=164) |  You'll start to get hints of an experience of sensory completeness. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=172) |  Where things get really extraordinary is when you can have a complete experience of feel-image-talk |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=181) |  all at once that integrates the mind and the emotions into a single arabesque of empty |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=195) |  energy. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=196) |  There's a oneness and a nothingness there. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=199) |  The world of concept and the world of emotion, which are often thought of as the head and |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=206) |  the heart being separate. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=209) |  The head and the heart literally are integrated. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=212) |  That's the oneness theme. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=215) |  They're integrated by having a complete experience simultaneously of feel-image-talk so completely |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=224) |  present in the moment that there's no time to fixate them. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=232) |  They manifest as a wave rather than as a particulate thing called a self or thing called thought |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=241) |  and feeling. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=243) |  That's quite an integration. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=244) |  That's quite a theme of oneness right there. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=248) |  But there can be a broader theme of oneness. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=252) |  That would be the theme of integrating not just the head and the heart, but the mind |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=260) |  and the whole body, not just the emotional body, but the physicality of the body, touch |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=265) |  space as I call it. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=267) |  If feel is the emotional sensations, all the other sensations, what are we going to call |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=272) |  them? |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=273) |  The itches and aches, the pressures and pains, the sleepiness sensations, ordinary physiology, |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=279) |  the pulse, etc., etc., hot and cold, bladders full, stomachs empty, all that sort of stuff. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=286) |  I call them touches whether they're on the surface or on the inside. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=290) |  The body is touch feel space. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=293) |  Well, there's a tradition in mindfulness practice. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=299) |  It's not a requirement, but it's something that's done by some people sometimes. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=305) |  It's very interesting. |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=307) |  You can learn a lot from it. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=308) |  It's done in other traditions too, but in our tradition, it's called strong determination |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=314) |  sitting. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=315) |  Aditana in the Pali language. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=319) |  It means you make a decision for a certain period of time, I'm not going to make any |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=324) |  voluntary movement. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=327) |  Typically it's a minimum of one hour, but I guess theoretically it could be anything, |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=332) |  one hour, two hours, three hours, four, half a day, whatever you want to do. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=339) |  I did a retreat once in Australia. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=343) |  It was a two-month retreat, and it was great. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=346) |  I didn't have to run a retreat. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=347) |  I was taking a retreat for two months. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=352) |  Didn't have to do anything but meditate. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=355) |  Of course, I wanted to make optimal use of that time. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=359) |  The way the schedule worked, there was this nice four-hour slot in the afternoon. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=369) |  I decided the first day, okay, for the next two months, I'll do a four-hour strong determination |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=376) |  sit during this slot. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=379) |  See what happens. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=380) |  You know what happens, right? |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=383) |  And it ain't pretty. |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=396) |  What happens is that after about an hour, you start to get some really significant pain. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=404) |  And then after about an hour and a half, you're gnashing your teeth and your hands are now |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=418) |  a sweaty fist. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=423) |  And then your body starts to shake uncontrollably, and then you're flooded with huge emotions |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=437) |  of fear and mental confusion and distorted thinking, ideation. |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=445) |  And then you start to lose control of your body. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=449) |  Your eyes start to go up into your head and you can feel like it's horrible. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=455) |  It's really, really bad. |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=459) |  However, it is, after all, just a huge eruption of touch, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=471) |  The will, the freak out is in feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=475) |  The pain is in the touch. |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MENPoNVg3bA&t=477) |  It's just a dance of four strands of sensory experience. |

     We can't always have enough concentration, clarity, and equanimity to have a complete experience of something.
