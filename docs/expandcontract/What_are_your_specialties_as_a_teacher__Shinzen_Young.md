    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=0) |  Someone wrote in and asked, what are your specialties as a teacher? |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=11) |  I think the first thing that comes to my mind is that I attempt to take the mist out of |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=19) |  mysticism. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=21) |  All around the world we find people that have had deep experiences of meditation and perhaps |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=32) |  gone beyond deep experiences of meditation to experiences of no self or enlightenment. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=40) |  And scholars of comparative religion who study such things say that they're studying comparative |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=49) |  mysticism. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=50) |  I think a more contemporary term would be contemplative studies, but it pretty much |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=55) |  boils down to the same thing. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=59) |  Mysticism sometimes refers to what I call the realms of power. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=65) |  That's sort of like the new agey kind of stuff. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=67) |  That might be called mysticism with a small m. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=73) |  But mysticism with a capital M, as is used by trained scholars of world religion, has |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=82) |  a very different meaning. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=83) |  It means the path into deep states and then the path beyond deep states to experiences |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=89) |  of enlightenment. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=92) |  If you look at the standard works on mysticism, most of the older ones, unfortunately, written |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=99) |  by people that were not themselves mystics, which is a little bit like sex manuals written |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=106) |  by perpetual virgins or books on the nature of music written by people that are tone deaf |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=115) |  or maybe deaf. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=116) |  But if you look at some of the older books on mysticism, the first thing that always |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=123) |  appears is this can't be described in words. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=130) |  That's almost the defining feature of mystical experience. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=133) |  Now it is quite true within the core of mystical experience, the experience of direct contact |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=144) |  with the source. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=145) |  There most assuredly are no words. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=149) |  No words in your head, no words coming out of your mouth, because there's no head. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=155) |  There's no body. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=156) |  There's no time. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=157) |  There's no space. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=158) |  So certainly no words. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=161) |  That is true. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=163) |  But can everything surrounding that be precisely put into words? |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=169) |  I think so, actually. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=173) |  That goes against a lot of established doctrine. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=176) |  But I think we can do this. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=177) |  We meaning the human species with enough time. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=181) |  So I would refer to that as taking the mist out of mysticism. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=186) |  Or another way to put it is developing a vocabulary around these really deep spiritual practices |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=198) |  that has the same precision and rigor as the vocabulary that has developed within science |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=205) |  and mathematics. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=207) |  It took a long time and centuries of contention and confusion for science to develop the precise |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=218) |  vocabulary it now has. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=222) |  This was not a quick thing and not an easy thing. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=225) |  We can speak about the natural world in a very powerful and precise way now, which we |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=231) |  couldn't say 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago, and so forth. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=237) |  So I think something like that can occur with regards to the mystical or contemplative experiences |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=245) |  that are universal to humans around the world. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=248) |  So I call that taking the mist out of mysticism. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=251) |  That's sort of one of the things that I view as my specialty. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=256) |  Another thing that I view as a specialty is that the way that I work with people is interactive. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=268) |  In other words, my system is designed to be taught and deepened and sharpened by real-time |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=278) |  interaction with a coach. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=280) |  So if you come to a residential retreat with me, you will have at least one or two times |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=288) |  where you'll have 90 minutes where it's just you and me. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=293) |  Well not exactly just you, it's effectively just you and me. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=300) |  That's a little complicated to explain how I do that, but I multi-process several people |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=306) |  working on telephones, but each one is privately working with me. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=310) |  I give you a technique, you get set up, I go work with somebody else, five, ten minutes |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=315) |  later I come back, okay, when you did that technique, this or this may have happened, |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=321) |  tell me which one happened. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=322) |  Depending on what you tell me, we're going to either keep to the same guidance, slightly |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=326) |  modify it, give you some new information, give you a choice of options, suggest that |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=330) |  you do this, etc., etc. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=332) |  It's an algorithm that loops and branches. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=335) |  Then I get you optimized, you're optimized now for the next five or ten minutes, I'm |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=339) |  off processing somebody else, doing the same thing for them. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=343) |  They don't hear what you're going through because you're all on separate telephone lines. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=348) |  Then I come back to you, okay, what happened? |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=352) |  Now if you call me up at home, if you're someone that comes to my retreats, I actually give |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=358) |  you my own home telephone number and you can call me at home, then you have a one-on-one |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=363) |  interactive session with me. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=365) |  Unlike traditional systems that are sort of like, okay, here's the cushion, here's the |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=370) |  technique, now go off and do it, come back in a few hours, come back in a few days, come |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=374) |  back in whatever and we'll see what's happening. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=379) |  I do micro-interactive coaching, like having a personal coach next to you while you're |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=385) |  using pieces of exercise equipment. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=388) |  My metaphor is that my five ways are exercise stations and if you have someone from the |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=396) |  staff of the YMCA next to you while you're using the anomalous equipment, you're going |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=401) |  to have an optimal experience of using it. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=405) |  Another specialty of mine is this interactive personal coaching way of teaching the practice. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=415) |  Another thing that may be unique, I don't know if it is unique, but it may be unique |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=421) |  to my approach is that I didn't develop my approach alone. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=427) |  I developed my approach through taking feedback from students and taking suggestions from |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=434) |  students. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=436) |  Maybe 50% of what's innovative in what I teach, I didn't discover, a student discovered. |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=443) |  Sometimes a student with not a whole lot of experience, but in interacting with them, |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=450) |  they had sort of seen something that was very significant. |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=454) |  So for three decades, I've been intensely collaborating with my students, developing |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=463) |  the five way system. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=464) |  It wasn't just like, okay, I'm alone and I'm going to figure out how to do this. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=471) |  So it's actually been a sort of distributed collaborative endeavor. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=476) |  And that may be, that certainly is unusual in the history of these things. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=482) |  I don't know if it's entirely unique, but it's probably another distinctive feature |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBcFuRNszA&t=488) |  of what I do. |

     Someone wrote in and asked, what are your specialties as a teacher? I think the first thing that comes to my mind is that I attempt to take the mist out of mysticism. All around the world we find people that have had deep experiences of meditation and perhaps gone beyond deep experiences of meditation to experiences of no self or enlightenment.
