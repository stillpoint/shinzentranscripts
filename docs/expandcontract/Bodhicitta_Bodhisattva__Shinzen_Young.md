    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=0) |  Bodhicitta |
    | [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=4) |  The bodhicitta spontaneously wells up in people, |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=8) |  and they just know that their job is to love and serve, |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=12) |  which I relate to pre-Buddhist shamanic things. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=19) |  I mean, I've been in sweat lodges with fully traditional Lakota, Sioux, |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=26) |  talking about their experiences in vision quests, |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=31) |  where they would have this vision of all of humanity, |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=35) |  and they would see the people suffering, |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=39) |  and they could see the whole world. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=42) |  They had this calling, they knew it was their job to care, etc. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=48) |  I think this is something that is by no means distinct to Buddhism. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=55) |  But in Buddhism, it's sort of codified as the bodhisattva ideal. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=59) |  There's the arising of Mahayana Buddhism, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=63) |  historically, about 2,000 years ago, |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=66) |  so about 500 years after the Buddha. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=69) |  The Mahayana literature has two themes. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=74) |  There's this sort of like, |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=76) |  okay, karuna is as important as prajna, |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=79) |  in other words, compassion, meaning broadly, service, love. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=84) |  What you put out into the world is now philosophically |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=89) |  on an equal footing with the liberating wisdom. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=93) |  That's one thing that was characteristic of Mahayana literature. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=99) |  The other thing that was characteristic of Mahayana literature |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=102) |  is everything's empty. There's no one to save. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=105) |  That's the prajna paramita, that's Mahayana text, |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=109) |  the Mahayana critique of early Buddhism. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=113) |  In other words, they say, well, there's two things wrong with early Buddhism. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=117) |  One is that although the practice of service may have been there, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=126) |  it was not philosophically emphasized, |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=130) |  so early Buddhism sounds like a spiritual selfish, |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=135) |  hence the term Hinayana, or small vehicle. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=139) |  The other thing they say that was wrong with early Buddhism is |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=143) |  that they thought that you get to know self |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=148) |  by teasing apart the skandhas, right? |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=152) |  But you have to realize that the skandhas themselves are empty, |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=156) |  as is everything. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=158) |  It's not just that there's no thing called the self, there's no thing. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=162) |  That's the shunyavada, or teachings about emptiness. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=166) |  So those two co-arise. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=169) |  It's like, we've got to save the world that's really not there. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=175) |  Getting those two clearly, that's the bodhicitta. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=182) |  After the night comes the dawn. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=188) |  It's a natural cycle. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=193) |  After the impersonal comes the personal. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=200) |  The return of the human, the same, but changed for the better. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=210) |  Focus on positive, if possible, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=214) |  directly from the nothingness and the energy. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=221) |  Let the self be remade, resurrected, |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=235) |  kinder, more fulfilled, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=254) |  rejoicing in service at all levels. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=261) |  Bodhicitta, bodhicittotvada, |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kBiqluARdU&t=266) |  the spontaneous upwelling of the bodhisattva aspiration. |

     Bodhicitta The bodhicitta spontaneously wells up in people, and they just know that their job is to love and serve, which I relate to pre-Buddhist shamanic things. I mean, I've been in sweat lodges with fully traditional Lakota, Sioux, talking about their experiences in vision quests, where they would have this vision of all of humanity, and they would see the people suffering, and they could see the whole world.
