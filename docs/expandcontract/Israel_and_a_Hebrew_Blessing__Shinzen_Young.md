    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=0) |  What did you chant at the end of the loving kindness? |
    | [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=4) |  A couple people asked what I chanted at the end of the loving kindness today. |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=10) |  That was Hebrew. That was a Hebrew blessing. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=13) |  I guess you probably figured it was Hebrew when you heard the word shalom over and over again |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=17) |  and the word Israel. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=20) |  So for me the word Israel, there's like Medinat Israel. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=27) |  There's the country, the modern nation state of Israel. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=30) |  Then there's Eretz Israel, the land of Israel, just what that land does. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=37) |  Then there's Am Israel, the Jewish people. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=43) |  But then when I think of the word Israel, just that word alone, |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=47) |  I don't think of a particular ethnic group or a country or even a region of the world. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=56) |  If you go back historically to where the word Israel came from, |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=62) |  it was a name given to the third patriarch, not the Zen patriarchs, |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=69) |  the third patriarch in the Jewish lineage. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=72) |  Who was? |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=75) |  Well, there was Avraham, Yitzhak, Yaakov, Yaakov, Jacob. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=82) |  So Jacob was struggled with the forces that were making it difficult to climb the ladder to the source. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=100) |  So anybody who's struggling to go up that ladder, which is all of humanity, |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=105) |  that's Israel to me anyway when I think of that word. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=110) |  So that was a famous blessing that, |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=113) |  Oseh shalom bimromav hu yaaseh shalom, alenu ve'al kol Yisrael, ve'imru amen, is what I chanted. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=123) |  So what's cool about it is that, I won't go into a whole discussion, |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=130) |  but the way that words are formed in Semitic languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=137) |  which is the language that Jesus spoke, they're formed from tri-consonantal roots, typically. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=145) |  That means there are three consonants that carry a general sense of meaning, |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=150) |  and then you stick vowels and other consonants in there to form verbs, nouns, and to make nuances of meaning. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=163) |  So shin, lamed, mem, those three Hebrew letters, they mean the peace that comes through completing. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=179) |  Shalem means complete, and shalom is peace. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=184) |  It's related concepts. You complete something, and then there is a peace that comes. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=192) |  And that's exactly how it works, isn't it? |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=195) |  When you have a complete experience, there is this extraordinary piece of the divine nothingness. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=204) |  That is, when you complete the sensory experience, it goes from particle to wave, |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=213) |  and then when the wave returns to the source, in that nothingness is true, absolute rest. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=224) |  But it's a rich nothingness because it has all this completeness about it. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=231) |  And the word nirvana has that sort of connotation. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=234) |  It's like ultimate rest, cessation, but also total fulfillment. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=242) |  So I gave an entire dharma talk in Israel on shin, lamed, mem, |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=250) |  taking it through many of the different permutations that it has in the Hebrew language. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=256) |  And this is very much, by the way, in the mode of rabbis. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=259) |  This is how they do their teaching. They play with the words and so forth. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=269) |  So it was really cool because you can explain the entire practice of the dharma in terms of those three letters. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=278) |  So anyway, ose shalom bimromav hu ya'ase shalom. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=285) |  May he or that which creates the peace of heaven make peace upon you and all Israel. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=300) |  Ose shalom bimromav hu ya'ase shalom, aleinu, upon you, ve'en, al kol Yisrael, all of Israel, |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=307) |  which as I say I understand is all of humanity because we're all struggling to get up that ladder to the source. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=315) |  Ve'imru and say amen. You probably recognize that word. It's the origin of the English word amen. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=323) |  So anyway, that's what that was. My rabbi used to say that a lot. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=330) |  I remember it from a kid. So I thought it's a nice, makes a nice thing for the, at the end of the loving kindness practice. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=361) |  Ose shalom bimromav hu ya'ase shalom, aleinu, upon you, ve'en, al kol Yisrael, all of Israel, |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=369) |  which as I say I understand is all of humanity because we're all struggling to get up that ladder to the source. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=377) |  Ve'imru and say amen. You probably recognize that word. It's the origin of the English word amen. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=385) |  So anyway, that's what that was. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=415) |  Ve'imru |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=446) |  Ve'imru |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbT9Zv8rcq4&t=452) |  Amen. |
