    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=0) |  I define mindfulness in my own personal way as bringing a three-fold attentional skill |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=14) |  set to experience. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=16) |  So the three skills are concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=23) |  As a result of bringing mindfulness to a sensory experience, that experience might change. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=31) |  The change in the experience that occurs is what I call the reaction. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=36) |  The reaction could be pleasant or the reaction could be unpleasant. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=41) |  The idea in the Recycle the Reaction axiom is to always remember that one of the things |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=51) |  you can do with the reaction is be mindful of it. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=56) |  So you take the reaction and you recycle it into being an object of the practice that |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=62) |  caused the reaction. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=64) |  So if you can remember that axiom, that deals with an awful lot of situations that come |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=71) |  up in practice that cause people to have questions. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=75) |  Because it's like, okay, I did this technique and it caused this wonderful pleasant experience. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=83) |  What should I do? |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=84) |  Well, apply the technique to it. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=87) |  I did this technique and it caused this horrific experience. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=91) |  What should I do? |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=92) |  Well, one of the things you can do, apply the technique to the reaction that the technique |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=96) |  caused. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=98) |  At a beginning level of practice, one of the most common phenomena that people have is |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=110) |  that they'll do the technique and then they'll go to a certain level. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=117) |  They'll feel like they've dropped into some sort of state. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=122) |  And then if they attempt to maintain the technique further, they just are thrust out of that |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=131) |  and they pop back into what seems like square one. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=134) |  It's like they're just back to ordinary consciousness. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=137) |  I call it the 20-minute glass ceiling, sometimes jokingly. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=144) |  You ask people, how long do you sit for? |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=146) |  Oh, I sit for 20 minutes. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=147) |  Now, there's nothing shabby about sitting for 20 minutes. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=150) |  In fact, I give people an even smaller minimum for daily practice. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=156) |  But people will often say, I sit for 20 minutes and then it's just time to get up. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=165) |  I'm back to my ordinary consciousness again and it's time to get on with the day and whatever. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=173) |  And it's like I'm not meditating anymore. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=176) |  And if I try to meditate beyond that, I'm just into scattered mind and ordinary consciousness. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=183) |  So the reaction to attempting to meditate beyond the 20-minute glass ceiling is you're |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=190) |  back to the state where you started. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=196) |  So recycle the reaction says, that's fine. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=199) |  You don't need to do anything like that. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=200) |  You don't need to get deeper again or struggle to get back to where you were 10 minutes before |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=209) |  that. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=210) |  You just take that reaction. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=211) |  It's coming up in feel, image, talk, activity, and you focus on that reaction. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=217) |  You recycle it. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=219) |  You make use of it. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=221) |  And then you will grow through that, even though it doesn't seem like you have that |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=230) |  deep state that you might think is the sign of quote good meditation. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=235) |  So that might be a representative sort of common thing that happens to beginner meditators. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=243) |  At a more intermediate level, it's actually sort of the opposite. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=249) |  Often people will come to me and they'll say something like, I was meditating and I dropped |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=260) |  into this deep state and then. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=266) |  Now when they say and then, I pretty much know what they're going to say. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=272) |  I give it 80% probability that they're going to say, and then I became terrified. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=279) |  In other words, they spontaneously dropped into a deeper state than they'd ever been |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=287) |  in, and there was a kind of no self experience. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=293) |  The reaction to that was fear, which is actually a very common reaction. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=300) |  What to do? |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=302) |  Recycle the reaction. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=304) |  Really love that fear to death, know that fear to death. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=310) |  Just let it happen. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=312) |  It's coming up usually primarily in feel space, that is to say the emotional body. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=317) |  So you apply your technique to it. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=320) |  And however long or short that fear reaction to going deep comes up, you just work with |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=326) |  it and that's sort of your task. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=330) |  You recycle the reaction. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=333) |  At some point you've worked through the fear. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=336) |  The depths of your being knows that there's nothing objectively dangerous in that experience, |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=343) |  and so you are able to continue to progress. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=351) |  Another thing that happens to intermediate meditators where they have to recycle the |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=355) |  reaction is, as the result of doing the practice, they develop an aversion to being around a |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=363) |  ordinary people, their former friends, their family, because they realize how different |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=370) |  they've become and it's like they can't relate. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=374) |  That's definitely an intermediate phenomenon. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=379) |  That's not where this practice is meant to lead. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=381) |  In fact, this practice is meant to lead to the very opposite of that, a joy in being |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=386) |  with ordinary screwed up people in their screwed upness, just hanging out with them because |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=393) |  you know that you have something to give to them at a subtle level just by who you are. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=399) |  So if you get that reaction of not wanting to be around non-spiritual, screwed up ordinary |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=406) |  people, then you see that that reaction is coming up in your own feel-image talk and |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=415) |  you apply your practice to it until you work it through. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=419) |  Among advanced meditators, you get this very tricky thing called the dark night of the |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=424) |  soul or the pit of the void, where everything is very flat. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=431) |  It's nice because there's not the horrific drama and suffering that you had before, but |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=437) |  it seems like your humanity has been taken away and the old edge and the old fire isn't |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=445) |  there anymore. |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=446) |  That's also a reaction to this practice. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=449) |  When you bite into emptiness, the first thing you encounter is the skin of the apple. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=456) |  It's not representative of how juicy the fruit actually is. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=461) |  So if you sort of freak out because the enlightenment has a bleak side to it, then you watch your |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=471) |  reactions to that. |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=472) |  You work that through. |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=474) |  You recycle that reaction and the true spring and bounce and vitality of the void will eventually |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyRaFN3TKYM&t=483) |  manifest itself within you. |
