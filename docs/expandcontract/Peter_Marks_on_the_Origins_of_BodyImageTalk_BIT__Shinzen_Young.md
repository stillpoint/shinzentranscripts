    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=0) |  This paradigm that I give you where we can divide the mind into the image piece and the |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=12) |  talk piece, and then that interacts with the body, the touch, feel, whatever. I didn't |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=20) |  come up with this, this idea. But the person who did come up with it is in this room, so |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=28) |  I'm going to make his feel image talk space activate. Where's Peter? If it's the first |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=37) |  time or so, you may not know who this man is. This is Peter Marks, the inventor of body |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=43) |  image talk, and essentially the person responsible for this approach to meditation that I teach |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=56) |  being available consistently in Canada. The fact that I kind of stumbled onto one day |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=69) |  saying, I noticed that there's these pictures and these, I mean, that he kind of is far |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=75) |  too generous in what I've contributed to this. I mean, believe me, it's like, it's like kind |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=81) |  of, I came to know with three boards, but he did the arc himself. Well, here's what |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=88) |  happened. He was giving me a guided, okay? This part I know about because I journaled |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=94) |  this part. He was giving me a guided, and I was just telling him what I was experiencing, |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=101) |  and he said, what did you say? That's how, that's it. I didn't come to him and say, coach, |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=108) |  I've got a really great idea. If he hadn't have picked it up, I might not even have known |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=113) |  I said it. I mean, that's the honest truth because I thought that's what everybody saw, |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=117) |  you know? But there is. What did I say? Oh, I was just, I was out loud. I said, oh, I |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=124) |  see. Well, he was having me look at what we now call active states, right, of image and |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=130) |  talk, okay, or of just thinking. We just, just thinking. I mean, if you read a lot of |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=137) |  the stuff, it's just thinking. They don't talk about breaking it down the way he has, |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=140) |  right? So I just, I just basically, he said, what are you experiencing? And so I just, |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=145) |  I just said, you know, talk, talk. We didn't have any of the restful stuff at that time. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=149) |  Well, remember, Joe? I mean, we didn't have restful stuff. Rest is within five, six years, |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=153) |  isn't it, I would say? Four. Four years, is that right? Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=158) |  And so, and so I was just saying, you know, thinking and talk and talk and then said picture, |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=167) |  picture. And that's what I call it. I call it a picture. And he said, what did you say? |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=173) |  I said picture. Now, you see, it's hard to believe with his mind that he hadn't experienced |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=178) |  that. But I suspect that he had experienced it, but he just goes so deep that he just |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=184) |  misses some of that surface stuff. I mean, I have no idea. But for each of you, you likely |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=189) |  know the first time you did this, you had a predominant way. This is what I think my |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=192) |  students, there's a predominant image or talk that they come up with, right? And then once |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=198) |  you introduce them and give them a little bit of a heads up, then they'll say, oh, yeah, |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=201) |  I am. And now that you're doing it, you know that at every minute you're having ten hits |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=205) |  of image, ten hits of thought, and also the rest states all at once, right? The more you |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=209) |  start to really look at this stuff, you see it's all over the place all the time, right? |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=213) |  I mean, it's just layered, scaffold upon scaffold, right? So that's why it's just so fascinating |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=220) |  to see the way he's, I mean, this divide and conquer piece, you know, it's just, that's |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=224) |  the other thing about him, this, these unique ways of just summarizing it. Yeah, we've come |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=231) |  up with a lot of things. I was either blessed or cursed to have some of the early days of |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=235) |  him kind of feeling his way on some of these things, you know, and some of the, you know, |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=241) |  sweat work we did and that, it just, things just kind of evolved, I think. But more important |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=247) |  to your second point, I mean, it's just, it's just so great to see what, I mean, he literally |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=252) |  has, you know, rounded this thing out to 99 plus 9% of what it is, you know, I mean, and |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=257) |  just, and just really, as I say in the acknowledgement of this book slash manual that I've written, |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=263) |  just such a great acknowledgement that he is just, you know, relieving suffering on |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=267) |  this planet with this stuff just in such incredible ways. There's something else that I've had |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=274) |  to really restrain myself today because in my own lingo, in my own time, all the time, |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=278) |  I teach to bit, excuse me, be fit, body sensations, feeling, image, and talk. So that's be fit, |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=285) |  okay? And that's, that's about 10 years ago, that's what we were. We were body sensations, |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=291) |  feeling, image, and talk. And there's several of us oldies that still have not really bought |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=296) |  into the idea of, of, should I, should I, should I, yeah, yeah. I don't know where to |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=303) |  go with this because it's, you know, it's public and all that, but, but hey, the big |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=306) |  guys heard me tell them a dozen times and we have some very, very animated discussions |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=311) |  over, you know, and I basically say, you know, I think you're being dead right on this one, |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=316) |  Shinzen. I think you're absolutely right in separating, you know, kind of touch and feel, |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=323) |  and I'm sure that it's, you know, the feel is maybe all in the body. I mean, you know, |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=327) |  so therefore you can legitimately fit spaces, body, and image. However, I think for the |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=332) |  average person learning it, they relate to a body sensation like the pain in my knee |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=336) |  and they relate to a pain in my heart different. So that's why I've continued to teach just |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=341) |  be fit. So I just say this because stay open to this. And if he was here, he'd say the |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=345) |  same thing. Don't just buy what I tell you. Like make it your own. He's always saying |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=348) |  make it your own. So some of us have just not chosen to kind of come on board with some |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_Crcg-A0f0&t=352) |  of the current stuff, but for the most part we are. |
