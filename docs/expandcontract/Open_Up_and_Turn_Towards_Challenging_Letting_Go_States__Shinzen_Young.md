    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=0) |  Letting go, if we use that term as an equivalent for equanimity, will certainly, on the average, |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=12) |  eventually cause us to feel better and better and better. However, for short periods of |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=20) |  time, particularly in the early years of one's practice, one can go through periods where |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=27) |  the deeper one goes, the more uncomfortable one becomes. One of the classic manifestations |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=34) |  of that is the more we relax, the more icky, sticky, yucky kinds of antsy, unbearable sensations |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=45) |  arise within us. I have a whole article about that. I call it the icky, sticky, creepy, |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=52) |  crawly, doesn't really hurt, but I can't stand it flavor of sensation. That has a very peculiar |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=59) |  characteristic that the deeper you drop into samadhi and the more you relax, the yuckier |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=66) |  it gets, at least for a while, creating a negative feedback loop, causing a person to |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=71) |  be disinclined to drop into the deeper states. In fact, I once heard a senior Burmese teacher |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=78) |  who I had studied with, Usil Ananda, refer to it as samadhi pain in English. I'd never |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=88) |  heard that phrase. Maybe he made it up, but clearly he was familiar with the phenomenon. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=96) |  That's one of the forms that going deeper makes things yuckier. There are other manifestations |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=103) |  of that disorientation. For example, you go deep and you get disoriented or you seem more |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=111) |  vulnerable, etc., etc. I can only say that these are temporary phenomena. They're not |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=120) |  characteristic of the big picture, the long-term practice. Essentially, we can say that the |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=127) |  spiritual path is a path of shedding gradually one coping mechanism and acquiring another |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=139) |  coping mechanism for life. The coping mechanism that's being shed could be succinctly characterized |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=148) |  as deal with what comes from the outside and comes from the inside by tighten up and turn |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=155) |  away. That sort of works. It armors. It's basically an armoring and denying strategy, |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=165) |  which can sort of blunt things, but in the end doesn't really work very well. Hopefully, |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=174) |  a person will eventually mature to the point where they realize, oh, there's a better way |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=179) |  of going about dealing with the impact of the intensity of the outside and the stored |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=185) |  poison and pain on the inside. They cultivate that better way. The tricky thing is that |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=192) |  that better way is ultimately a better way. However, it is the diametric opposite of the |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=201) |  former way. It could be succinctly characterized as open up and turn towards. The open up is |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=208) |  the equanimity piece. The turn towards is the sensory clarity piece. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=213) |  Because it's the exact opposite of the previous strategy, it's difficult to avoid what I call |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=221) |  awkward intermediate states where the old strategy is being shed so it can't quite shield |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=228) |  you anymore. In other words, the mesh of your being is somewhat opening, but it makes you |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=235) |  vulnerable because it's not so open that the slings and arrows will pass through without |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=243) |  catching. You don't have the tight mesh that sort of shields you. That creates this awkward |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=251) |  intermediate stage. There's no way around it because that's the price of going from |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=258) |  one coping mechanism to another. If we think of enlightenment as the most stable state, |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=266) |  the ground state of our being, then there are other states that would not be as deep |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=273) |  as that. Let's say that we're in a relatively grounded state here, but we would like to |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=280) |  go to the global optimal, the most grounded state possible for the system, which might |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=287) |  be called our source. It will often happen that in a thermodynamic system, in order to |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=303) |  make the transition from a relatively stable state to a relatively grounded state, we have |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=310) |  to go over this metastable, ungrounded situation. One actually passes through a lot of those |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=317) |  things, but there'll be a tendency to drop eventually to the deepest ground state. That's |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=324) |  sort of the price one may have to pay for moving on to the next level of what we call |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=354) |  the ultimate endowment, that is the ultimate survival, but all of the following can happen |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=357) | urally. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=357) |  That's a good question. That's the thermodynamic question youngrung should be finally ask, |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=357) |  where is there such a technology for survival? That's why we do a big international project |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=357) |  in BNP and MD to support the nature, nature consortium efforts that the BNP is actually |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=357) |  serving. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTcGmoaLyv0&t=357) |  Just let the discussion be needs and what the big Christina Eicster is thinking. |
