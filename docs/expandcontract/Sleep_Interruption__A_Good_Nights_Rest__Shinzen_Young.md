    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=0) |  Sleep interruption on the meditative path is actually, I would say, not uncommon, particularly |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=14) |  at retreats, but it can also sort of spread into daily life. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=21) |  We can look upon the meditative path as a journey from the surface of consciousness |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=29) |  to the source of consciousness. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=32) |  Another way we can look upon it is that we are sort of pouring concentration, clarity, |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=40) |  and equanimity from the surface down into the depths. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=45) |  Actually those two metaphors refer to exactly the same thing. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=49) |  If we take the second metaphor, that here we are on the surface and we're sort of shining |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=54) |  the flashlight of mindfulness on the surface of consciousness, and some photons are trickling |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=60) |  down into the depths, giving the depths what they need to rewire themselves. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=69) |  If we take that metaphor, then it's not surprising that there should be some interruption in |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=79) |  or some impact on sleep. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=83) |  Sometimes as the result of meditating, a person may find that they sleep deeper and better |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=91) |  than they ever dreamed possible. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=95) |  Other times there can be exactly the opposite effect. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=99) |  There's consciousness inside the sleep. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=101) |  You don't really, you may have difficulty falling asleep or there's still awareness |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=108) |  going on during the sleep and so forth. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=111) |  I should say that the long-term effects will be to sleep both deep and consciously. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=122) |  So if in the short term you find that you're not sleeping deeply because some consciousness |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=129) |  is coming in there, then there's no need to freak out. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=135) |  There's a very senior vipassana master named S.N. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=140) |  Goenka who teaches in the U Ba Khin lineage of Burmese vipassana. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=147) |  He gives some very good advice to students about what to do if you have any disturbance |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=153) |  in your sleep patterns. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=155) |  He says do two things. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=158) |  First, continue to lie down with the body very still so that the body physically gets |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=166) |  rest. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=167) |  In other words, don't flail around, don't get up, actually don't even get up and sit |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=172) |  and meditate. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=174) |  Make sure the body gets well rested by being lying down and still. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=178) |  That's guideline number one. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=182) |  Guideline number two, make sure that consciousness gets rested by maintaining a continuous meditation |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=190) |  technique. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=192) |  So those are the guidelines I give to people if they get disturbances in their sleep due |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=198) |  to the practice. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=199) |  As I say, it's not inevitably the case that you're going to get disturbances like that. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=205) |  Meditative practice may make you sleep deeper than you ever dreamed possible. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=211) |  But on occasion, it could have the opposite effect. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=213) |  In fact, the guidelines of keep the body still and relaxed and keep consciousness engaged |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=220) |  in a meditation technique, I apply not just to the effects of meditation in disturbing |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=227) |  sleep, but it's my general guideline for anybody that's having insomnia or difficulty sleeping |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=236) |  for whatever the reason may be, including emotional turmoil or physical pain or just |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=244) |  some sort of sleep disorder. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=246) |  I say part of the negative cycle that people get into is they have difficulty getting to |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=254) |  sleep or staying asleep. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=257) |  And then they're freaking out because, well, if I don't get a good night's sleep, I'm going |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=261) |  to have a crummy day. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=264) |  And then the worry over that further agitates and prevents them from getting sleep. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=272) |  So how to break that vicious cycle is a cognitive reframing. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=277) |  Instead of the notion, I've got to get a good night's sleep, you entertain the notion, I've |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=284) |  got to get a good night's rest, which may or may not involve actually losing consciousness. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=292) |  It's possible to get a good night's rest without losing consciousness at all. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=298) |  And in fact, in very experienced meditators, that's indeed what happens. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=302) |  I had one Taiwanese master that I lived with for about a year in southern Taiwan in the |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=309) |  city of Tainan, and he attempted never to lose consciousness at night. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=315) |  He would sit for four hours from eight to twelve, and then he would lie down for four |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=323) |  hours from twelve to four. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=327) |  During that period when he would lie down, he would maintain a mudra like this, which |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=332) |  would be a biofeedback device. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=334) |  If he lost consciousness, it would collapse and wake him up. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=338) |  And he attempted every single night to spend the entire night conscious, but deeply, deeply |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=344) |  resting. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=345) |  And I've trained people with chronic pain and whatever who can't get to sleep really |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=352) |  ever very well, I train them to get deep rest, keep the body still, keep a technique going. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=363) |  So if the disturbance in sleep happens for any reason, either because these photons are |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=369) |  trickling down, causing the unconscious to rewire itself, and so you have weird dreams |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=376) |  or difficulty sleeping, or just whatever the cause may be that's disturbing the sleep in |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=386) |  terms of dreams or not falling asleep, so what you do is you simply keep the body still |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=396) |  and keep your technique going. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=398) |  And as the result of that, you will train yourself to get deep rest, good rest. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=406) |  And in very experienced meditators, yes, it is true, the difference between waking and |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=413) |  sleeping sort of goes away. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=416) |  In other words, like the Christian mystics used to say in the Middle Ages, ego dormio |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=422) |  sed cor meum vigalet, I sleep but my heart waketh. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=428) |  You have the depth of sleep but there's consciousness there and that is a very fulfilling state |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQFw2jNf7s&t=437) |  of consciousness to put it mildly. |

     Sleep interruption on the meditative path is actually, I would say, not uncommon, particularly at retreats, but it can also sort of spread into daily life.
