    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=0) |  There's a lot of research that has been done on this. |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=5) |  When I lived in Japan, |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=9) |  they would carry, to keep you awake |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=13) |  and also to sort of help you with physical discomforts, |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=17) |  but mostly to scare you into alertness, |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=22) |  they carry what's called a keisaku |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=25) |  in the Rinzai-zen tradition. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=29) |  called a kyo-saku in the Soto-zen. It's the same Chinese characters that mean |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=35) |  wake up stick, literally. Wake, waking stick or wake up stick. But also the same |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=43) |  character that means wake up, it also means startle actually. And I used to |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=49) |  carry the keisaku and whack people and people used to carry the keisaku and |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=53) |  whack me. And when I came back to the United States, I initially moved into a |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=62) |  Vietnamese style Buddhist temple in Los Angeles, the International Buddhist |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=67) |  Meditation Center on New Hampshire in Koreatown. It's still there. And because I |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=75) |  had been in Japan and had the Zen background, I initially sort of taught in |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=81) |  the Zen mode. So I had a keisaku and I used to use it at retreats. And this is |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=94) |  way, way, way back in the 70s. Security was not, you know, the crazy fear that it is |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=107) |  now at airports and so forth. So I would actually carry the keisaku onto the |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=113) |  plane. Sometimes they'd ask, you know, at the checkpoint, sort of like, what's that? |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=120) |  Right? And I said, well, it's used for giving a Japanese massage, which is |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=127) |  true. When it's done right, and I've had the privilege of having it done right by |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=136) |  real masters. I once got sakud by a roshi, not Sasaki Roshi, a different |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=145) |  roshi, who was also a kendo master. Imagine what it would be like to be a |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=150) |  basketball being dribbled by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Okay? That's what my body |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=158) |  felt like. It was like he could dribble me at the end of the keisaku, like pick |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=162) |  me up and put me down. I mean, obviously physics laws don't allow for that, but |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=167) |  it sort of seemed like, I mean, he had that much power at the end of that thing. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=173) |  And when it's done right, it hits on what I think is called bladder 21, which is |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=180) |  both a stimulating point and a mellowing out point at the same time. And boy, that |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=187) |  is what it does to you. Okay? It causes a shower of endorphins. It doesn't, I mean, |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=195) |  hurts a little bit, but it doesn't really like hurt the way you might think it |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=199) |  hurts. All your muscles relax, all the pain goes down right down into your toes |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=203) |  if it's done right. And you are awake. You are definitely awake. So I used to carry |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=214) |  it, you know, at IBM, at the International Buddhist Meditation Center. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=219) |  But what I noticed is that as I began to move more into the vipassana mode, |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=227) |  I noticed that, first of all, initially people are like really scared. And then |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=239) |  they develop an addiction to it and want it. See, they could request it the way I |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=244) |  was doing it. So it's like, oh, I'm sort of fostering fear and then addiction here. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=251) |  And maybe, you know, it's like, well, so I just sort of got out of the habit. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=258) |  Years later, I discovered Sasaki Roshi, and I translated for him for five years, |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=269) |  but didn't really study with him. But then I guess, you know, the center of |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=274) |  gravity just gradually had a strong enough influence that I just couldn't |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=279) |  resist. So I started to go to sessions at Mount Baldy. So it's like, by that time I |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=289) |  meditated for quite a while. It's my first session at Mount Baldy, and they're |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=293) |  sitting, and they bring out the kesaka, right? They walk in a very menacing, |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=303) |  threatening way, intentionally, with a kind of mincing pace that sort of like |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=309) |  gives you the impression at any instant they're gonna turn, they're gonna |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=313) |  suddenly turn around and beat the living crap out of you, okay? Now, mind you, it |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=321) |  feels good, okay? And I've had it done to me, and I'd done it to people for |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=330) |  years and years and years previously, okay? So I'm sitting there, and it's like |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=341) |  the guy starts to walk by, you know? And this terror arises within me, |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=351) |  this primordial, intense, intense terror. Actually, I couldn't even control my body. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=362) |  I actually started to move, so I got hit, okay? Which felt good, but so you |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=377) |  might think, and that happened every time for the whole session, and for |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=382) |  the next session, and for the next session, okay? It was like that's what the |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=388) |  whole thing was about, was like I'm like sweating bullets and shitting bricks |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=394) |  every time these guys are carrying the stick, which is frequently during the day. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=401) |  So now you might think that the self-talk would be like, what is wrong |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=410) |  with me, okay? That I'm having this huge overblown reaction, but that's not the |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=422) |  self-talk that arose, not in the slightest. What arose was wisdom function |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=429) |  that understood what was happening, why it was happening, and what to do about it. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=436) |  So what was the difference? What, 15 years ago when I was in Japan, and they'd carry |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=445) |  it with the same threatening, you know, whatever, okay? And I didn't even notice |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=450) |  it. I was so lost in my thoughts, and you know, in my memory, plan, and fantasy, |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=459) |  whatever, I didn't even notice what was going on. Years and years and years of |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=465) |  meditation, be careful what you ask for, you know, how many people come to me and |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=470) |  say, oh, if only I could have a peaceful mind. Well, you can have a peaceful mind, |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=477) |  but there's a price to pay for a peaceful mind. What's left if the image |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=483) |  and talk turns off? What's left of you? What's left of you is a frightened |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=489) |  little infant's body is what's left of you. And so when Darth Vader is coming |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=502) |  out of the world of threatening archetypes, okay, that's all that |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=511) |  was there. Now, could I have turned that all off by rationalization? Easy, just |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=520) |  start thinking. It's like, okay, that's so-and-so, and I've known him for years, |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=526) |  and he's a friend of mine, and if he hits me, it's gonna feel good. I could |
    | [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=531) |  rationalize away the fear, but that's not the idea. The idea is to scour down into |
    | [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=538) |  the infantile animal levels of your being, no matter how embarrassing that |
    | [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=543) |  might be, no matter how inconvenient that might be, you don't rationalize it away, |
    | [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=549) |  you train the body at that primitive level, and it doesn't, you just, it's like, |
    | [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=558) |  okay, that's what's happening, and I know exactly what to do, and eventually it |
    | [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=565) |  reached the point where as soon as they started to carry the kesaku, this wave of |
    | [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=571) |  power fear would spread to me, turn into flow, cause me to merge with the person |
    | [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=579) |  carrying the kesaku and the entire room, and it was like just catharsis city, this |
    | [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=588) |  bliss city. So you want oneness? Well, one way to get it is work through |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjzEeSSL4o0&t=593) |  separateness at the primitive level of the body. |
