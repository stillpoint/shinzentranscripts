    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=0) |  OK, maybe we have time for one or more other questions. |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=7) |  Harpakai? |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=9) |  Something I've noticed around the wandering mind |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=13) |  is very much related often to focus on positive. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=17) |  It's just that it's an unconscious focus on positive. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=22) |  So when a person's mind is wandering in meditation |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=26) |  and it's a problem for them, often |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=31) |  if they're able to detect the pleasure component |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=38) |  or the interest component at that point, |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=41) |  they make it conscious. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=43) |  And it's become like a positive focus technique |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=47) |  if they're able to actually do that. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=50) |  So in sharing this with students, |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=54) |  what has become very interesting is |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=57) |  where before the wandering mind for them drove them crazy, |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=61) |  now it's like, can I catch the wandering mind when it's |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=67) |  actually kind of an unconscious positive focus |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=70) |  and make it into a conscious positive focus? |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=74) |  And then they can stay with that and play with it or not. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=76) |  They can go back to their technique. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=79) |  And so anyways, it's just become like another window |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=82) |  of opportunity for them. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=84) |  That's cool. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=85) |  And that involves detecting the pleasant interest flavor? |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=91) |  Absolutely. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=92) |  Yes. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=92) |  That's pivotal. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=95) |  Tear, fear, tear. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=96) |  Yeah, the three R's. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=99) |  My theory of what drives human attention, the three R's. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=103) |  Tear, cheer, fear. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=105) |  In other words, sadness, interest, and fear, I find, |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=111) |  are the basic flavors that control where our attention |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=114) |  goes. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=115) |  And whereas at the beginning, the wandering mind |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=118) |  is a source of suffering, they can |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=120) |  reframe it so that the wandering mind turns |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=123) |  into freedom from suffering. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=125) |  That's really clever. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=127) |  Can I use that? |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=128) |  No, no, no, no. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=129) |  It can also be used if you're working with the do nothing |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=148) |  technique. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=149) |  And what often, of course, prevents people |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=152) |  from having the do nothing technique be a, quote, positive. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=159) |  Good experience. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=160) |  Good experience is, in fact, the wandering mind. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=164) |  So there's a way to do the do nothing technique where |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=166) |  you alternate between the do nothing technique |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=170) |  and the making wandering mind into a positive focus. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=173) |  You can kind of play with that. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=175) |  Go ahead. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=176) |  You can use that too. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=177) |  So we need a quick term for this thing |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=183) |  that you're doing with the wandering mind. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=187) |  And I think I've come up with the name of the technique. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=192) |  Do I know? |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=194) |  No. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=197) |  We'll call it the happy wanderer. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=199) |  OK. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCtjOgXsOuo&t=209) |  Good. |
