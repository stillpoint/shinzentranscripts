    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=0) |  Certainly, one of the most frequent questions from beginner students is, why meditate? |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=14) |  What's the whole point of it? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=18) |  Why are we doing this kind of thing? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=22) |  I've given actually a fairly elaborate classification of the reasons to meditate in terms of the |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=35) |  notion of total human happiness, that we meditate for our own personal, unconditional happiness |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=44) |  as well as for our personal happiness. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=47) |  And we also meditate so that we can best contribute to the conditional and unconditional happiness |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=54) |  of others. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=55) |  That's sort of the model that I give. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=61) |  From beginners, the question would be, why should I even bother doing this? |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=66) |  And essentially, the answer is, well, this particular case is mindfulness practice, a |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=78) |  certain form of meditation. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=81) |  And this form of meditation elevates your concentration, clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=87) |  And if you elevate your baseline of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, then you'll elevate |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=94) |  your baseline of human happiness in the broadest and deepest sense or senses that a human being |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=107) |  can be happy. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=108) |  So in all the different ways that a human being can be happy, including the deepest |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=113) |  possible ways a human being can be happy, for all of the above, we do this practice. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=119) |  You might say that the centerpiece is sensory happiness independent of conditions. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=129) |  And sensory happiness independent of conditions comes about when you're able to have complete |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=135) |  sensory experience of your body and your mind. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=143) |  And you have complete sensory experience of your body and mind when you cross a certain |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=148) |  threshold of intensity of concentration, clarity, and equanimity applied to body sensations |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=155) |  and the thinking process. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=157) |  Then your experience of ordinary body-mind becomes utterly extraordinary. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=163) |  And your relationship to your body and mind change from your body and mind being a prison |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNoDhIKDb0w&t=170) |  to your body and mind being a home where you abide but can leave any time you want. |

     Certainly, one of the most frequent questions from beginner students is, why meditate? What's the whole point of it? Why are we doing this kind of thing? I've given actually a fairly elaborate classification of the reasons to meditate in terms of the notion of total human happiness, that we meditate for our own personal, unconditional happiness as well as for our personal happiness. And we also meditate so that we can best contribute to the conditional and unconditional happiness of others. That's sort of the model that I give. From beginners, the question would be, why should I even bother doing this? And essentially, the answer is, well, this particular case is mindfulness practice, a certain form of meditation. And this form of meditation elevates your concentration, clarity, and equanimity. And if you elevate your baseline of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, then you'll elevate your baseline of human happiness in the broadest and deepest sense or senses that a human being can be happy. So in all the different ways that a human being can be happy, including the deepest possible ways a human being can be happy, for all of the above, we do this practice. You might say that the centerpiece is sensory happiness independent of conditions. And sensory happiness independent of conditions comes about when you're able to have complete sensory experience of your body and your mind. And you have complete sensory experience of your body and mind when you cross a certain threshold of intensity of concentration, clarity, and equanimity applied to body sensations and the thinking process.
