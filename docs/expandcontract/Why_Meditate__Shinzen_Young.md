    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=15) |  The first dimension is reducing suffering, the ability to experience unavoidable pain |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=23) |  with less problem. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=27) |  The second is elevation of fulfillment, the ability to experience even small pleasures |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=34) |  with enormous satisfaction. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=38) |  The third dimension where meditation impacts is self-understanding. |

    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=50) |  really shines is to understand who you are at the deepest level. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=56) |  The fourth dimension is meditation will help you make objective changes in behavior. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=63) |  So if there's something you're doing that you need to stop doing or something you should |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=68) |  be doing that you're procrastinating or putting off, you can use meditation skills to behave |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=77) |  more skillfully in the world. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=82) |  Reduce suffering, elevate fulfillment, understand yourself at all levels, including the deepest, |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=89) |  improve behavior, and ultimately to find within yourself a spirit of serving or contributing |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=100) |  to the happiness of others that comes from a spontaneous love. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=107) |  And actually, that spirit of love and service is a consequence of success in the other four |

    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1TnEQlbPwg&t=117) |  As you suffer less, are more fulfilled, as you understand who you are, and as you have |

     Meditation optimizes five fundamental dimensions of human happiness. The first dimension is reducing suffering, the ability to experience unavoidable pain with less problem. The second is elevation of fulfillment, the ability to experience even small pleasures with enormous satisfaction. The third dimension where meditation impacts is self-understanding. It's actually helpful to understand yourself at a psychological level, but where meditation really shines is to understand who you are at the deepest level. The fourth dimension is meditation will help you make objective changes in behavior. So if there's something you're doing that you need to stop doing or something you should be doing that you're procrastinating or putting off, you can use meditation skills to behave more skillfully in the world. Reduce suffering, elevate fulfillment, understand yourself at all levels, including the deepest, improve behavior, and ultimately to find within yourself a spirit of serving or contributing to the happiness of others that comes from a spontaneous love. And actually, that spirit of love and service is a consequence of success in the other four dimensions. As you suffer less, are more fulfilled, as you understand who you are, and as you have a handle on changing how you carry yourself, all of that sums up ultimately in how you contribute to making this world a better place.
