    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=0) |  I find that I typically don't have just one flavor of challenging feel. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=14) |  I may say to myself, I'm angry, and like I say, I'm not sure this is true of other people |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=20) |  or whether it's a stage in practice or just idiosyncratic to me, but I may say to myself, |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=27) |  I'm angry, but when I do a flavor analysis of what's going on, it seems to me that it's |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=37) |  like wine. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=40) |  It's got a full nose and it's got some tannins and there's hints of raspberry and apple with |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=54) |  a long syrupy finish. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=57) |  They give you this description, it's like, did somebody just make this up? |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=63) |  Does somebody actually experience that when they drink this wine? |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=67) |  If you're not a wine connoisseur, it's like, what are they talking about? |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=71) |  Well, there's all of these nuances in wines if you're into such things. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=79) |  Well, I guess I'm not much of a wine connoisseur for a number of reasons actually. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=85) |  Probably that's a good thing. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=88) |  But I have sort of become an affective somesthesia connoisseur. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=93) |  Affective is the fancy Latin word meaning related to emotion. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=98) |  Soma is body, asthesia is sensation. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=102) |  So affective somesthesia is the long Latin, Greek way of saying feel. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=108) |  Now I detect all these subtle nuances. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=110) |  It's like, yeah, it's anger, but there's that hint of sadness there. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=115) |  And oh yeah, there's this fear up my back. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=121) |  And subtle is significant. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=123) |  Subtle flavors that may be very mild relative to the main flavor, if they multiply in, have |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=131) |  a huge effect. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=132) |  If you've got 10 units of anger, but you've got two units of fear and two units of sadness, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=146) |  and you don't notice the fear and sadness, they're there, then instead of having 10 plus |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=153) |  2 plus 2, you're going to have 10 times 2 times 2. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=158) |  They're going to weigh in multiplicatively rather than additively. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=163) |  That's part of what I mean when I say subtle is significant. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=166) |  So divide and conquer, that's another way of saying untangle and be free. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=173) |  So and if that doesn't work, subdivide until you do conquer. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=177) |  You're noting feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=178) |  Okay, well maybe we need to divide the feel into flavors. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=183) |  And then I'd work just with the anger, and then just with the fear flavor, and just with |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=192) |  the sadness flavor. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=194) |  Work with them individually until there's clarity, there's a little more equanimity. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=199) |  Then when I generically note feel, I'm aware of all of them, but they've been individually |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=204) |  clarified and equanimized. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=206) |  So now as an aggregate, they're clarified and equanimized. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=212) |  If that doesn't work, subdivide until you do conquer. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=217) |  After you've broken it into flavors, what's next? |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=219) |  Break the flavors into locations. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=222) |  I'll work just with the sadness. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=225) |  And I do what I call radial sweeping. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=228) |  So okay, so I got the ache in the heart, so go to the core of that. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=233) |  Now how far does it extend to the right? |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=235) |  I sort of sweep the awareness out like a cone going to the right until I come to the end |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=240) |  of sensation. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=241) |  Maybe it's in the body, maybe it's at the skin, maybe it's between the skin and the |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=245) |  wall, maybe it's beyond the wall. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=247) |  I move out here, I get that whole sector. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=250) |  And it's like, okay, that's just the sadness, just in that sector on the right. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=256) |  Come back in, now the sector on the left. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=259) |  Just that flavor, how far does it go? |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=261) |  Now in front, behind, above, below. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=265) |  So I do flavor by flavor, sector by sector. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=270) |  Until I get it to manageable pieces. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=275) |  It's a time-space volume of one flavor of sensation. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=280) |  And that's untangled enough so that I can penetrate that. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=290) |  Penetrate means get a sense that my awareness is soaking into it and my being is opening |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=295) |  up to it. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=297) |  And then you integrate it. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=299) |  So I work with all the flavors in all the six sectors. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=306) |  And I worked with the image, and I worked with the talk. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=309) |  Now let's go back to generic, to broad. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=313) |  Just note, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=314) |  But now individually, I've sort of worked with them individually, so now collectively |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=320) |  they're clearer and more quantized, getting closer to complete experience. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=328) |  You have to let go of the agenda to get answers. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=334) |  And you have to let go of the agenda to get comfortable. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=337) |  The normal reward is I get answers, I get comfortable. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=342) |  If you let go of the agenda to get answers and get comfortable, you still get a reward |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=349) |  at some point. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=350) |  You get the taste of purification. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=353) |  And even if you don't have answers and you're not comfortable, that's enough of a reward. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=360) |  Easy place to learn it? |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=361) |  In pain. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=364) |  Much more challenging place to learn it? |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=366) |  In rage, terror, grief, shame, embarrassment, humiliation. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=372) |  Is it learnable by me or you or actually any other human being? |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=379) |  Absolutely. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=380) |  You just have to want it. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=382) |  You have to want it a lot. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=384) |  You have to realize it's important. |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=387) |  If you're willing to do that, then you start to see that yes, there's light at the end |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=396) |  of the tunnel. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=398) |  Sasaki Roshi talks about becoming a human being of complete feeling. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=407) |  So that's an awesome attainment, to be a human being of complete feeling. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=413) |  Can you do it? |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=414) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=415) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=416) |  You can do it. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=417) |  There's no person in this room that can't do this if they want to and if they take measures. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=424) |  So the measures are implement the technique, do it on a consistent basis. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=430) |  Here you have nothing to do but it. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=434) |  It's wonderful in that sense. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=436) |  Now of course, because we're dealing with, in a sense, the ultimate evolutionary challenge, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=444) |  it's the robot trying to gain control of itself, trying to be free. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=455) |  The robot was designed by evolution to be a robot. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=460) |  So it's the ultimate challenge, really. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=465) |  When those sensations come up, they were designed by evolution to give immediate, approximate, |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=477) |  and intense responses for the animal in the veld. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=487) |  But immediate, approximate, and intense responses are not necessarily called for in human society. |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=498) |  But because they were honed by evolution to do this, instead of motivating and directing, |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=505) |  which they're meant to do, and that's fine, they often end up driving and distorting. |
    | [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=513) |  The they is feel, the feel flavors. |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=517) |  Instead of motivating and directing, which they do do many times, and that's fine, we're |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=523) |  not trying, certainly not trying to get rid of feel or deny it in any way whatsoever. |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=528) |  We're trying to love it to death, to completeness. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=533) |  When you have complete feel, it only motivates and directs. |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=537) |  It does its job. |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=539) |  It loses its power to drive and distort. |
    | [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=543) |  But it's a long, long task. |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=547) |  Yes, I just described a tough job, but somebody's got to do it. |
    | [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TILyiv8UsSU&t=554) |  And guess who those somebodies are. |

     I find that I typically don't have just one flavor of challenging feel. I may say to myself, I'm angry, and like I say, I'm not sure this is true of other people or whether it's a stage in practice or just idiosyncratic to me, but I may say to myself, I'm angry, but when I do a flavor analysis of what's going on, it seems to me that it's like wine. It's got a full nose and it's got some tannins and there's hints of raspberry and apple with a long syrupy finish. They give you this description, it's like, did somebody just make this up? Does somebody actually experience that when they drink this wine? If you're not a wine connoisseur, it's like, what are they talking about? Well, there's all of these nuances in wines if you're into such things. Well, I guess I'm not much of a wine connoisseur for a number of reasons actually. Probably that's a good thing.

If you've got 10 units of anger, but you've got two units of fear and two units of sadness, and you don't notice the fear and sadness, they're there, then instead of having 10 plus 2 plus 2, you're going to have 10 times 2 times 2.

So divide and conquer, that's another way of saying untangle and be free. So and if that doesn't work, subdivide until you do conquer. You're noting feel, image, talk. Okay, well maybe we need to divide the feel into flavors. And then I'd work just with the anger, and then just with the fear flavor, and just with the sadness flavor. Work with them individually until there's clarity, there's a little more equanimity.

Maybe it's in the body, maybe it's at the skin, maybe it's between the skin and the wall, maybe it's beyond the wall. I move out here, I get that whole sector.
