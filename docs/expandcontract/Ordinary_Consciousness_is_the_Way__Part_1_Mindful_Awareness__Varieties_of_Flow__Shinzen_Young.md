    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=0) |  I decided a long time ago that I would talk about all the kinds of experiences that may |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=23) |  happen to people, even though there's a certain danger in that because it sets up expectations, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=30) |  cravings, aversions, comparison mind, desires, and so forth. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=38) |  So I just give you the little heads up. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=41) |  Nothing that I'm going to describe tonight in terms of sensory experiences are required |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=49) |  for the classical path to enlightenment. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=53) |  You may have experiences like what I'm going to describe. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=56) |  You may not. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=58) |  There's lots of different arcs that people go through in traversing the territory between |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=68) |  surface and source. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=71) |  So one of the themes that can come up for a person is the theme of impermanence, anicca |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=80) |  in the Pali language, anitya in Sanskrit. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=84) |  I have a set of techniques for working with this theme. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=92) |  I call it focus on change. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=95) |  There's nothing mystical, schmistical, or special about the fact that sensory experience |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=103) |  changes. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=104) |  If you've ever noticed a sensation get stronger or get weaker, anybody ever notice that? |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=114) |  Then you've noticed impermanence. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=115) |  It changed. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=118) |  Intensity levels vary. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=122) |  You may think that my back's been aching in an unvarying way all afternoon. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=132) |  You say, my back hurt all afternoon. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=136) |  So my back's been hurting all afternoon. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=142) |  Sort of sounds like that, right? |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=143) |  The afternoon started. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=145) |  The afternoon is over. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=149) |  Sounds like it's a constant function. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=151) |  But if you pay close attention, it's not exactly a straight line. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=158) |  It's sort of like, well, it was a little more, then a little less, and a little more, then |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=162) |  a little less. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=163) |  There's maybe a little bit of ripple on that if we speak more accurately. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=173) |  As we begin to look a little bit more accurately still, this changingness may become more evident. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=187) |  A sense of rising, passing begins to appear. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=193) |  Remember last night I said that the more you focus on the impermanence, the more sensitive |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=205) |  you become to it. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=209) |  That's sort of like the clarity and the concentration piece. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=212) |  But the more equanimity you have with things, since equanimity makes you more flexible, |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=223) |  I would compare concentration to muscle strength, and maybe clarity is like definition in training. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=234) |  So equanimity would be analogous to flexibility. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=238) |  So as you become more flexible, of course, you can reflect the flow of impermanence, |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=246) |  spirit if you wish. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=248) |  So at some point, you may actually get a sense that what was just the hint of a ripple or |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=256) |  became peaks and valleys, that actually there's rising, passing, rising, passing, rising, |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=265) |  passing, rising, passing, like that. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=271) |  I sometimes like to ask a rhetorical question. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=281) |  Do mountains dance? |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=284) |  And I would suggest to you that there's three possible answers. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=288) |  Yes, no, and it depends. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=294) |  And I would say it depends. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=296) |  It depends on how patiently and how carefully you look at a mountain. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=305) |  If you look with the patience of centuries, in other words, great equanimity, timeless. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=313) |  Equanimity is a kind of timeless world. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=315) |  Some of you have gone into this. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=317) |  You may have had an experience either under conditions of great ease or under conditions |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=325) |  of great peril. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=328) |  Time sort of slows down, and there's an altered sense. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=339) |  Well when you drop into equanimity, the deeper levels of equanimity, you have the patience |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=346) |  of centuries. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=348) |  And viewed with the patience of centuries, in other words, in time-lapse photography, |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=353) |  what does the surface of the Earth look like? |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=356) |  A roiling, streaming protoplasm, really alive with flux. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=367) |  So it depends on how patiently you look, in other words, how much equanimity there is. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=372) |  It's also how carefully you look. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=375) |  If you look at anything beyond the level of the atom, or the molecule for that matter, |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=380) |  it's just a dance of energy, a mountain. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=385) |  But if you don't look really finely, or you don't look so there's not the clarity piece, |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=391) |  if you don't look patiently, there's not the equanimity piece, then the mountain seems |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=395) |  solid as a rock, as the expression goes. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=399) |  So subtle is significant. |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=402) |  If that hint of ripple is an entire world rising, passing, rising, passing, rising, |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=411) |  passing, there are different flavors of impermanence or change. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=423) |  One is change in intensity. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=426) |  I just sort of graphed that. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=430) |  Another very significant way that sensory experiences change is they sort of shift in |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=435) |  shape. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=436) |  Remember, we've made a big thing about the spatial nature of experience, that you can |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=440) |  localize, perhaps not with great precision, but you can sort of get a general sense of |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=446) |  size, shape, and position of body sensations. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=450) |  And indeed, even auditory thoughts have a sort of size, shape, and position in your |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=457) |  head, visual thoughts up in front, in image space, and so forth. |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=463) |  So if you sort of zoom out and cover the whole area of, say, a sensation, you may notice |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=473) |  that it shifts a little bit here, shifts a little bit there. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=476) |  Subtle is significant, may not be all that dramatic, but it's like a millimeter here. |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=483) |  It sort of like moves over here, moves over there. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=485) |  And as you're watching that little waviness and whatever, and you're infusing it with |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=491) |  equanimity and time is passing, those shifting shapes can become much more significant and |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=501) |  fascinating. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=502) |  You can get so fascinated with how it moves that you become less concerned with whether |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=512) |  it's pleasure or pain. |
    | [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=514) |  It all starts to feel good. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=515) |  Even uncomfortable sensations feel good because of the way they move. |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=520) |  There's like a fascination with it, almost a massage to it. |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=524) |  Marshall McLuhan said the medium is the message, right? |
    | [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=529) |  But I would take it one step back. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=533) |  The nature's deepest message is not the medium. |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=542) |  It's the movement of the medium. |
    | [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=545) |  That's a primordial message that flows through all of nature. |
    | [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoSAkuNJWQ8&t=552) |  And since our sensory systems are part of nature, flows through us. |
