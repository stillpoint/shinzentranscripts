    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=0) |  Last night, I gave a whole riff on the Jewish meditation tradition, and I ended with this |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=25) |  Lurianic Kabbalistic concept of what a human being or a human soul is, which I find delightful |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=36) |  since it literally maps one-to-one with the way that I present the meditation techniques. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=49) |  If we want to define broadly the self, that would be body-mind experience. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=58) |  So in that case, in terms of the standard categories, it's touch, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=67) |  But then as you pay very close attention to any of those or any combination, you begin |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=76) |  to notice the presence of change. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=83) |  And the more you pay attention to rates of change, the more you're also paying attention |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=91) |  to what might be called underlying forces. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=94) |  This is basic, actually basic Newtonian physics. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=99) |  Don't have to get esoteric with quantum or relativistic. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=106) |  Invisible force fields can be detected in terms of how they impact accelerations. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=114) |  As you're noticing rates of change, you get a sense that there is a kind of fundamental |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=125) |  and impersonal doing that sort of pervades the physicality of the body, the emotionality |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=134) |  of the body, the mental processes. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=138) |  Zen master Rinzai talked about wu-wei zhen ren. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=145) |  I love that expression. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=153) |  The true person, the authentic person that everyone has within them that has no fixed |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=165) |  position whatsoever. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=168) |  And I just screwed up, started to write my own name instead of... |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=173) |  Well, same character. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=175) |  The true or authentic is zhen in Mandarin, shin in Japanese. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=184) |  So wu-wei zhen ren, mui no shinjin in Japanese pronunciation. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=191) |  That true person within us that has no fixed position, in other words, isn't a thing, but |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=197) |  is a doing. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=200) |  And I'm not sure if it was Rinzai or another Zen master that talked about the invisible |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=207) |  hand inside the puppet. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=211) |  And would you believe it? |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=213) |  Some of the Kabbalistic masters had exactly the same metaphor. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=219) |  As you're paying attention to that expanding, contracting, vibrating field that moment by |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=231) |  moment is churning the body-mind-self into existence in a cleft, producing a cleft within |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=245) |  which it arises, which is totally the Kabbalistic theme, you become aware that that activity |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=252) |  wells up and subsides. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=254) |  It comes from a one rich nothing. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=260) |  In other words, you start to notice how there's a rising and then there's a neutralizing to |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=269) |  a kind of nothing, and then there's an absolute continuity between the gone and the next arising. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=278) |  So there's a continuum. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=281) |  This is non-dual awareness. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=283) |  There's a continuum between the nothing, the polarization of the nothing, the arising of |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=292) |  physical, emotional, and mental self, and then the reabsorption of that back into the |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=301) |  energy that then flatlines again. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=304) |  When you reach the point where that is an absolute continuous process, then you're doing |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=313) |  pretty good in your practice. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=316) |  And when you reach the point where that happens as you're bopping around in the world taking |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=322) |  care of business, then you're doing really, really, really good in your practice. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=328) |  In fact, that gets you up there to the zen master, the beginnings of the zen master class |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=339) |  of meditator. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=341) |  So I have you look at physicality in the body, emotionality in the body, the mental images |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=349) |  and internal talk that are the mind, then the underlying flow, and its vanishing into |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=358) |  the one zero. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=359) |  Because all vanishings, all zeros are uncreated, equal. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=369) |  They're all the same zero. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=372) |  Therefore to the extent that you're anchored in that, your belly button and the belly button |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=380) |  of any other piece of creation overlap. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=388) |  And you share the same belly button, you share the same womb, and therefore you have a sense |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=394) |  of the fraternity and sorority of all of creation. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=400) |  Would you believe it? |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=403) |  According to the Kabbalistic notion of what a human being is, what a soul is, a soul, |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=411) |  that's the word that they often translate, but I think it's really what a person is. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=419) |  The soul is called naran chai. |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=422) |  You have the physicality of the body, then you have the emotionality of the body, ruach, |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=428) |  then you have above that, neshama, which is the mental process. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=434) |  So that's image talk. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=436) |  Touch, feel, this is image talk. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=441) |  Underlying all and pervading all of that is chai, the impersonal energy that would correspond |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=448) |  to what I call flow, but what in China they might call chi and so forth. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=457) |  And it is emphasized by the Kabbalists that these last two, even though they pervade the |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=465) |  person and the person is in intimate moment-by-moment contact with them, they are not part of human. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=476) |  They are the part that links the human to the source. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=482) |  Specifically chai is this kind of energy and yechida comes from the root echad, meaning |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=489) |  one. |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=491) |  It's the one, the one what? |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=494) |  The one nothing. |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=496) |  The one belly button. |
    | [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=499) |  The one zero that is the source of the molding force. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=507) |  It's where it comes from, it's where it goes back to. |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=510) |  So that's the gongs, that's the vanishings that I have you label. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=515) |  So if I were to have you say, okay, we're going to work in the body, mind, self, and |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=522) |  we're going to note touch, feel, image, talk, and we're also going to note flow and vanishing, |
    | [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfNdNA580yk&t=531) |  flow and gone, we would be essentially using the Lurianic Kabbalistic formulation. |

     Last night, I gave a whole riff on the Jewish meditation tradition, and I ended with this Lurianic Kabbalistic concept of what a human being or a human soul is, which I find delightful since it literally maps one-to-one with the way that I present the meditation techniques. If we want to define broadly the self, that would be body-mind experience. So in that case, in terms of the standard categories, it's touch, feel, image, talk. But then as you pay very close attention to any of those or any combination, you begin to notice the presence of change. And the more you pay attention to rates of change, the more you're also paying attention to what might be called underlying forces. This is basic, actually basic Newtonian physics. Don't have to get esoteric with quantum or relativistic. Invisible force fields can be detected in terms of how they impact accelerations. As you're noticing rates of change, you get a sense that there is a kind of fundamental and impersonal doing that sort of pervades the physicality of the body, the emotionality of the body, the mental processes. Zen master Rinzai talked about wu-wei zhen ren. I love that expression. The true person, the authentic person that everyone has within them that has no fixed position whatsoever. And I just screwed up, started to write my own name instead of... Well, same character. The true or authentic is zhen in Mandarin, shin in Japanese. So wu-wei zhen ren, mui no shinjin in Japanese pronunciation. That true person within us that has no fixed position, in other words, isn't a thing, but is a doing.
