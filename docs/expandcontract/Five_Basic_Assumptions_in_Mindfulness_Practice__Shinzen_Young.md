    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=0) |  There are certain axioms or basic assumptions behind mindfulness. |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=10) |  These lead to not logical conclusions, but when implemented they lead to experiential |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=21) |  developments within a person. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=24) |  I say that there are certain assumptions that underlie mindfulness as I would teach it. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=31) |  I think that they're very reasonable assumptions, that they could be accepted by anyone, but |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=41) |  they are assumptions. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=42) |  The first assumption is that the ability to focus on what one deems relevant whenever |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=52) |  one wants, to have that ability is better than to not have that ability. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=58) |  That's an assumption, although some of the work in positive psychology would seem to |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=64) |  prove that assumption. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=66) |  But anyway, we can take that as a basic axiom. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=70) |  In other words, it's better to have the ability to concentrate on what you want than to lack |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=76) |  that ability. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=77) |  Notice, by the way, I said the ability to focus on what you deem relevant at any given |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=83) |  time. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=84) |  I didn't say that you're necessarily constrained to go around as a concentration machine in |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=91) |  an always highly focused state, but that you have the ability whenever you want to focus |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=97) |  on what is deemed relevant in that circumstance. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=100) |  That's the axiom of concentration. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=103) |  Then there's an axiom that it's better to be sensorially clear about what's going on |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=111) |  than to be sensorially muddled. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=115) |  That's another assumption in mindfulness. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=120) |  Third axiom is that it's good to be able to not fight with yourself, at least have that |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=130) |  ability. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=132) |  Sometimes you might have to fight with yourself under certain circumstances, but most people |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=138) |  always are fighting with themselves in subtle ways, very, very microscopic subtle ways without |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=143) |  even realizing it. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=145) |  It's good to have the ability not to fight with yourself. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=149) |  That's the axiom of equanimity. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=152) |  Then there's a fourth axiom that I call recycle the reaction, which is as the result of applying |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=161) |  the axioms of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, your sensory experience may change. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=168) |  It may change temporarily in unpleasant ways, or it may change in pleasant ways. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=175) |  It is even possible that strange experiences might arise. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=182) |  They do for some people, not for everyone. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=185) |  As the result of merely applying what would seem to be fairly innocuous axioms of concentration, |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=192) |  clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=194) |  The fourth axiom is really important because it tells you what to do if the first three |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=200) |  axioms produce anything that's challenging, either in the sense that it's pleasant and |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=206) |  therefore you might get addicted, or in the sense that it's unpleasant and therefore you |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=211) |  might suffer, or in the sense that it's weird and therefore you might freak out. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=218) |  As the result of applying the first three axioms, reactions might take place, not inevitably, |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=224) |  not saying they will take place for everyone. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=226) |  Not everyone gets heavenly or hellish or bizarre phenomena, but just in case they do, remember |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=235) |  the fourth axiom, recycle the reaction. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=240) |  Then there's one final axiom, the fifth axiom, which is if you forget the first four axioms, |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=249) |  the fifth axiom says have contact information of a competent guide and call them, and they'll |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=258) |  remind you of the first four axioms. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=263) |  Those are the five axioms. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1QWEk9c0D4&t=264) |  Hey, Euclid had five too, by the way, five postulates, so I'm in good company. |

     There are certain axioms or basic assumptions behind mindfulness. These lead to not logical conclusions, but when implemented they lead to experiential developments within a person. I say that there are certain assumptions that underlie mindfulness as I would teach it. I think that they're very reasonable assumptions, that they could be accepted by anyone, but they are assumptions. The first assumption is that the ability to focus on what one deems relevant whenever one wants, to have that ability is better than to not have that ability. That's an assumption, although some of the work in positive psychology would seem to prove that assumption. But anyway, we can take that as a basic axiom. In other words, it's better to have the ability to concentrate on what you want than to lack that ability. Notice, by the way, I said the ability to focus on what you deem relevant at any given time. I didn't say that you're necessarily constrained to go around as a concentration machine in an always highly focused state, but that you have the ability whenever you want to focus on what is deemed relevant in that circumstance. That's the axiom of concentration. Then there's an axiom that it's better to be sensorially clear about what's going on than to be sensorially muddled. That's another assumption in mindfulness. Third axiom is that it's good to be able to not fight with yourself, at least have that ability. Sometimes you might have to fight with yourself under certain circumstances, but most people always are fighting with themselves in subtle ways, very, very microscopic subtle ways without even realizing it. It's good to have the ability not to fight with yourself. That's the axiom of equanimity. Then there's a fourth axiom that I call recycle the reaction, which is as the result of applying the axioms of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, your sensory experience may change. It may change temporarily in unpleasant ways, or it may change in pleasant ways. It is even possible that strange experiences might arise. They do for some people, not for everyone. As the result of merely applying what would seem to be fairly innocuous axioms of concentration, clarity, and equanimity.
