    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=0) |  This was way back at the end of the Vietnam War. I was living in a Vietnamese Buddhist |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=12) |  temple, but not in Vietnam. It was a Vietnamese ethnic temple in Los Angeles. You may remember |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=18) |  the news footage of the people clinging onto the helicopters in Saigon, trying to get out |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=25) |  and whatever. What happened was that there was this huge influx of Vietnamese refugees. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=36) |  They were sent to marine camps, dedicated marine camps throughout the United States. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=43) |  One of the big places they were sent was Camp Pendleton, which is near San Diego in Southern |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=48) |  California. The temple where I was living, the International Buddhist Meditation Center, |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=54) |  was in L.A. It was really interesting to see the marines in action. They realized that |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=68) |  at least half of the people that were coming into that camp would be Buddhist. The other |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=75) |  half would be Catholic, because that's sort of the religious breakdown in the country. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=82) |  They could handle the Catholic, because that's international. You just get Catholic priests. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=90) |  But they were smart enough to know that there were Buddhists, Buddhist clergy in the United |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=98) |  States. They were smart enough to, in fact, know that there were Americans that had been |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=102) |  trained in the Vietnamese stuff. The U.S. Marines contracted with the temple, our temple, |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=114) |  to hire a Buddhist clergy that would be there when those refugees arrived. They went out |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=123) |  and they bought Buddha statues. They had these tents set up. It was there for these people |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=129) |  that the night before had been hanging from the helicopters. They were that organized. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=134) |  That was actually quite impressive. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=137) |  What happened was that a whole bunch of us went down the morning after the thing of the |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=147) |  people on the helicopters. We went down on a bus to Camp Pendleton. We could see people |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=154) |  coming in buses. The people we'd seen on the news the night before hanging from the |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=159) |  helicopters were being bused into this. It was amazing to see the look on their face |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=168) |  when they saw Americans of all races in Vietnamese Buddhist robes and able to chant and do the |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=175) |  liturgy in Vietnamese. There's this expression, to meet the Buddha in hell. For them it's |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=187) |  hell. It's the last thing in the world they would ever expect going to the United States |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=191) |  on a military camp. The first thing they're going to see is native-born Americans that |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=197) |  are capable of working within their tradition as Buddhist chaplains. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=204) |  The reason I thought about this was there were among those refugees a certain number |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=210) |  of Buddhist monks, as you might imagine. They would want to get out of the country if it |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=214) |  was going to go communist. I noticed that among all the Buddhist monks there, there |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=223) |  was one that was young, but no matter where you would see him, he would always be surrounded |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=229) |  by people. He was like a people magnet. His English was pretty limited, but through a |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=240) |  combination of his limited English and writing in Chinese characters, because I can write |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=246) |  Chinese and the monks in Vietnam learn how to write classical Chinese. Through the limited |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=253) |  English and us writing back and forth with Chinese characters, I was able to talk to |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=258) |  him. His name was Thich Dung Nguyen. I said, it's like, what's the deal? People seem |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=270) |  to relate to you very differently from any of the other Buddhist clergy that's here. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=276) |  They said, well, my teacher taught me loving-kindness practice from the very get-go. Loving-kindness |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=283) |  is a traditional version of the focus on positive feel. From the time he was just a little kid, |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=295) |  he was trained to radiate this out. You could see the objective impact it had on the people |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=301) |  around him. Anyway, at an advanced level, it's not just going to be in your body. It's |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=308) |  going to go out of the body in all six directions. It would be just like a high-wattage broadcast |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KFJYzPYDfA&t=315) |  of human positivity. Sound like a plan? Yeah. |
