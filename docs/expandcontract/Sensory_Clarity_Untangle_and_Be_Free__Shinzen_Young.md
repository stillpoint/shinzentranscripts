    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=0) |  This notion of sensory clarity as a vehicle for insight and liberation. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=18) |  We don't have any historical record of this before the Buddha. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=26) |  Although he said there were Buddhas in the past, etc. etc. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=30) |  Basically the idea is you take the sense of self and you break it down into components. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=42) |  Now there's a lot of ways you can go about this. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=44) |  The four great elements, the four foundations of mindfulness, the five aggregates. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=50) |  There's a lot of possibilities, a lot of ways that the pie can be chopped up. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=55) |  If you're more on the, I don't know, scripturally oriented side, you're very concerned with |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=62) |  the particular sets of categories that are used to untangle the web of limited identity. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=75) |  But for me I'm not so concerned with the categories themselves as the general idea. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=82) |  I think it's one of the most significant discoveries of our human species. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=89) |  A parallel discovery took place in the West and in fact is one of the things responsible |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=97) |  for the domination of Western culture. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=102) |  But in the West the principle, the principle of separate the strands and you can understand |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=108) |  how the thing works and gain a handle on it. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=111) |  That principle was never applied internally but it was applied externally to the external |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=118) |  natural world in many, many domains starting with the Greeks. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=124) |  And the Greeks gave us a word for that process. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=127) |  It is a Greek word that means to break something up in order to understand it and be empowered. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=138) |  Analysis. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=139) |  Analysis now implies some sort of intellectual formulation. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=145) |  I'm going to analyze the situation. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=152) |  But originally the word analysis meant exactly what those morphemes mean. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=159) |  It meant take the complicated thing, break it down into its pieces, see how the pieces |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=164) |  interact with each other and you'll understand how the complicated thing works. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=169) |  It's divide and conquer. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=171) |  Strategema de divide et impera. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=175) |  The strategy of if you can untangle, if you can find out what the fundamental dimensions |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=180) |  of the system, what are the primes, what are the atoms, what are the components that are |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=188) |  involved in this system, then you're going to get a handle on it. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=192) |  The West eventually discovered that the whole natural world could be analyzed in terms of |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=204) |  mass, length, time, thermodynamic temperature, and electrical current. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=214) |  Their interactions will give a complete understanding of the natural world, at least as known to |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=226) |  modern physics. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=228) |  But it took centuries and centuries and centuries of contention, argument, confusion to finally |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=238) |  be able to define these components of the natural world. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=241) |  But it allowed for the arising of physics, and physics allowed for better ships and better |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=248) |  cannons and better machines, and that allowed for the domination of Europe over the rest |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=256) |  of the world. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=260) |  The West used divide and conquer in order to conquer the material world. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=269) |  But in the East, the Buddha discovered divide and conquer in order to conquer our limited |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=275) |  identity, in order to conquer our suffering, and the screwed up behaviors that come from |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=284) |  our suffering. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=285) |  He was called a conqueror. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=287) |  Some people don't like the divide and conquer. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=289) |  They think the conqueror is bad. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=291) |  But actually, one of the words that was used to describe the Buddha was Jina, J-I-N-A, |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=299) |  and that means the conqueror. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=302) |  Because when he was born, the court astrologer was called in by his father, King Suddhodana. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=311) |  The Buddha was born in the Kshatriya caste, which is the warrior caste of India. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=319) |  And the king asked the court astrologer, what do you foresee for my son Siddhartha? |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=328) |  The astrologer said, your majesty, you've given birth to an extraordinary child. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=333) |  He will either stay in the palace and conquer India, which for them meant conquer the world, |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=340) |  Jambudvipa, meaning expand your empire from being a little clan up in northeast India |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=348) |  to like you're running the show now, or he will leave this palace and conquer himself, |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=356) |  conquer his limited identity, and make his mark in history that way. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=362) |  His father wanted him to conquer the world, and so tried to keep him inside the palace. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=368) |  So this notion of if you want the more gentle formulation, untangle and be free, if you |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=377) |  want the more sharp formulation, divide and conquer. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=384) |  This is sensory clarity, the third component of mindfulness. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=388) |  And as far as I can, as I mentioned, as far as I can tell, this was like a unique discovery |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=394) |  and was central to the development of a whole new direction in human spirituality. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=404) |  These are skills, concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity, are skills that can be developed |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gXoGMrGH34&t=410) |  with time. |
