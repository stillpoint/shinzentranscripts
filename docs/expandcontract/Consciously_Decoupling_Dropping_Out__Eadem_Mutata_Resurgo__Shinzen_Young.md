    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=0) |  So when I have you work with things like tight sites, |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=20) |  that kind of thing, and we're working |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=23) |  in the objective spaces, you might say, |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=29) |  well, like sight and touch, if your eyes are open, |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=32) |  sight and touch are always there. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=34) |  I mean, obviously, right? |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=36) |  Your physical body is always there. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=37) |  The world is always there. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=40) |  But what can happen is that you can disconnect. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=45) |  That's just decouple is just my geek way of saying disconnect. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=50) |  There can be a, let's say you're working in the sight touch |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=54) |  system. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=56) |  It's possible that you could, for a moment, disconnect |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=59) |  from that system, either because you're about to go into reverie |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=68) |  or you're getting sleepy, so forth. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=71) |  So that disconnect actually causes an arrestful state. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=83) |  You're not looking at things anymore, |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=85) |  even though your eyes may be open. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=86) |  And all those sensations may be arising in your body. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=91) |  Your attention is going elsewhere. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=95) |  So all you can be aware of in your body |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=98) |  is that it's there in the lab. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=101) |  So it causes a restful state to arise for a moment. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=105) |  And that's your tell. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=108) |  You understand in poker, you know what a tell is? |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=111) |  It's a giveaway. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=113) |  It's like, you know what's going on by some external sign. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=119) |  So I want to train people to detect the moment when they're |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=124) |  being pulled away from their object of meditation. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=129) |  The way you detect that is by noticing |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=132) |  that for just a brief moment where you had been focusing |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=137) |  on active states, it's now gone restful |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=140) |  because you've disconnected. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=141) |  And I sometimes sort of obscurely |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=146) |  call that decoupling because it's |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=148) |  like in magnetic fields, there will be a coupling |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=153) |  and then they just disconnect like that. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=156) |  So that flux lines decouple. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=161) |  And you notice that, and then you come back |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=162) |  to whatever your object is. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=164) |  So you've got like one or two seconds |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=172) |  where it goes restful right before you're |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=177) |  either sinking or thinking. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=180) |  And if you note that, then that will bring you back |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=184) |  to your focus space. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=189) |  Yeah, you would drop it. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=191) |  Now, of course, you have an option |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=193) |  if you're decoupling and you're dropping |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=196) |  into really deep restful states, then maybe it's |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=200) |  time to focus on rest for a while. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=208) |  Because you have a conscious dropout, |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=211) |  because you have the categories, the restful categories |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=214) |  to work with, what for a beginner meditator |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=218) |  would have been a nod out. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=222) |  It would have been a nod out for a beginner, |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=224) |  but because of all the long years of practice, |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=230) |  it was a dropout, a dropout of the time-space continuum, |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=236) |  a moment with the source. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=238) |  So when you drop back in, the world was, |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=246) |  or we could say, we're in a Catholic place, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=254) |  so Latin's good. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=257) |  This is Christian, Christian phrase. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=260) |  Ea dem mutata resongo. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr7ghLGmm3U&t=265) |  I was resurrected the same but changed. |
