    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=0) |  One of the natural ones is 2 plus 2 plus 2 equals 6. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=26) |  So 2 for the body, 2 for the mind, 2 for world. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=30) |  So if you want to go body, mind, world, first of all, |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=33) |  you're clumping them that way. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=35) |  And secondly, you're choosing not |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=37) |  to make certain distinctions, perfectly legitimate. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=41) |  This path is about making distinctions |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=43) |  and destroying distinctions. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=45) |  I think I say that every day. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=48) |  The trick is to skillfully make distinctions |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=50) |  and to skillfully destroy distinctions. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=53) |  So if you want to go, well, let's keep things simple, |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=58) |  body, mind, world. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=60) |  Fine. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=69) |  Another natural parcellation is 3 plus 3 equals 6. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=77) |  Field-image talk functions as a system. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=81) |  You've got the subjective. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=83) |  And then that system is a system because it |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=89) |  reacts as a system in combos to touch-site sound. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=97) |  And it also proacts to spin memory-planned fantasy. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=101) |  So because it's a system, it makes sense |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=104) |  that the thing it reacts to is also a system. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=107) |  So you have the subjective triad versus the objective triad. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=112) |  So you can have 3 plus 3 equals 6. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=124) |  Another natural partition is another 2 plus 2 plus 2 |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=131) |  equals 6. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=131) |  But instead of body, mind, world, it's body, visual, |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=138) |  auditory. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=140) |  Now, a case could be made that, in fact, that's |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=143) |  the most natural parcellation because that |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=147) |  cuts to the most fundamental circuitry |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=151) |  organization of the brain. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=153) |  So another way to cut off the pie |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=155) |  is somatic-visual-auditory. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=159) |  And you are absolutely at, you know, |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=161) |  so that's touch-field-image, site-image, and talk-sound. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=168) |  So you're completely free to do it however you want. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=172) |  And so long answer to a short report, it worked. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON9nSWAaiWM&t=178) |  And that's my definition of the right way to meditate. |

     One of the natural ones is 2 plus 2 plus 2 equals 6. So 2 for the body, 2 for the mind, 2 for world. So if you want to go body, mind, world, first of all, you're clumping them that way. And secondly, you're choosing not to make certain distinctions, perfectly legitimate. This path is about making distinctions and destroying distinctions. I think I say that every day. The trick is to skillfully make distinctions and to skillfully destroy distinctions. So if you want to go, well, let's keep things simple, body, mind, world. Fine. Another natural parcellation is 3 plus 3 equals 6. Field-image talk functions as a system. You've got the subjective. And then that system is a system because it reacts as a system in combos to touch-site sound. And it also proacts to spin memory-planned fantasy.
