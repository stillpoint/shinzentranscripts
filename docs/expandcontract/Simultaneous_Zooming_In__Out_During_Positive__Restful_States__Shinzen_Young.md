    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=0) |  What is the difference between positive and negative? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=5) |  Very good point. Because normally it's like what I have people to do when they're freaking out in pain and emotions and things. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=14) |  But if you do it in positive, then it turns into bliss city. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=21) |  How can I do it with restful? |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=51) |  You just need to notice that physiologically it has to happen or the out-breath won't occur. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=57) |  So when you breathe out locally in the core of your body, there's automatic relaxation. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=66) |  As that's happening, if you spread awareness to how the whole body is also settled, the five limbs, the two arms, the two legs and the head, |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=78) |  that's actually an example of zoom in and out on a restful state. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=84) |  The restfulness from the core spreads and affects the whole body. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=90) |  So each out-breath just completely inundates you with physical relaxation. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgsOeMfOcEI&t=98) |  And that's a zoom in out on a restful flavor. That's very natural. |
