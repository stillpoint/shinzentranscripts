    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=0) |  Oh, I think it would definitely heal the world. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=14) |  If we take, if by that we mean stream entry and we mean millions and millions of people |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=22) |  having that experience. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=23) |  I don't have a scintilla of doubt. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=34) |  Well you have to look at the big picture. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=41) |  You have to look at all the people that were ever enlightened as they have been in the |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=52) |  world and then you have to compare that to as they would have been if they hadn't been |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=58) |  enlightened. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=59) |  And you have to take all the people because most enlightened people are not public figures. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=68) |  And there may be indeed a certain push to the ones that do become public figures that |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=74) |  also is related to whatever. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=79) |  So I didn't say it would heal the world right away either. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=87) |  Because remember, I use classical enlightenment as a rough equivalent to stream entry. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=95) |  So that's the first out of four steps. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=103) |  And usually about 20 years after stream entry you realize how unenlightened you really are |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=112) |  and that the work is now just starting. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=116) |  But you're guaranteed success essentially. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=123) |  So after a few hundred years of millions and millions of stream enterers, I think that |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=133) |  the course of this planet would pretty much take care of itself. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=140) |  Now of course, I mean if you want to think really ambitious, maybe if we had a really |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=153) |  deep model of enlightenment we'd be able to figure out how to churn out our hots with |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=159) |  consistency. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=162) |  That's only maybe five times as ambitious as turning out stream entries. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=170) |  Who knows? |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=171) |  Now if you start having millions and millions of our hots on the planet, it's very quick. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=183) |  So yeah, plenty of people that have seen the no-self screw up, but then you have to look |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=193) |  upon it from the big picture. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=196) |  How badly would they have screwed up if they hadn't done that? |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=200) |  Well I can think of maybe that I know personally of maybe a dozen people that have seen the |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=208) |  no-self, were authentically enlightened at least to the stream entry level, and had major |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=213) |  public screw ups. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=215) |  Maybe a dozen, okay? |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=217) |  But there's probably a hundred times that many enlightened people on the planet. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=225) |  That's one percent that we know about. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=229) |  But even those screw ups are, I can only think of a couple that I would say are really horrible |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=243) |  relative to the normal human screw ups. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=249) |  When the teachers screw up, by and large it's just normal human screw ups. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=257) |  People have sexual harassment bosses. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=260) |  So it's sort of like things people do, right? |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDqTY1W8Dk&t=265) |  I can only offhand right now maybe think of one or two that I would say were really bad. |
