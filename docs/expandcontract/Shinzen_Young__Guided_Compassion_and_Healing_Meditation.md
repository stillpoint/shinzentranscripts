    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=17) |  In connecting with that, we connect with the enormous web of similar things that have been |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=33) |  happening for tens of thousands of years all over the planet. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=42) |  This immense pool of poison and pain of humans hurt by other humans. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=56) |  We can connect to that. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=60) |  We have that within us. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=65) |  There's a place inside that's so far in that it's out in each one of us. |

    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=98) |  the vast net of hurt. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=106) |  We can see the causes. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=109) |  We can see the effects. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=113) |  And we can feel compassion for the victims, compassion for |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=126) |  the perpetrators, compassion for ourselves. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=146) |  End |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=176) |  And not only can we feel this, but it can be a source of empowerment to motivate us |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=205) |  to do even more in whatever way we can for this healing of the world. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LNRpkKzQh8&t=235) |  Amen. |
