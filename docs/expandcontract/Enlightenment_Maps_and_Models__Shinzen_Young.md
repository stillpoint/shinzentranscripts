    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=0) |  Is there a best model or map for the various stages of the spiritual path, including classical |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=18) |  enlightenment and all of its ramifications, the places, the directions that you grow from |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=27) |  it? |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=29) |  Is there a best model, a best map? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=32) |  It is possible that there is. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=37) |  I don't think anybody has found it yet. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=42) |  Probably what comes to mind for most people when they consider looking at the various |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=48) |  models, maps, stages, and so forth that have been developed in the past, probably what |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=57) |  comes to most people's mind is, well, which one is the most complete, which one is the |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=62) |  deepest, which one really tells where it's at, et cetera, et cetera. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=74) |  But for me, when I think about the various models, maps, for stages of spiritual unfolding, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=86) |  the first thing that comes to my mind is how poor they all are, actually. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=102) |  None of them is really very good. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=104) |  Now, you might think that that is a very shocking thing, and maybe that's a disturbing thing, |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=112) |  to hear a teacher like myself say something like that. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=118) |  But actually, I take this as a huge, huge positive. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=124) |  So let me repeat. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=127) |  The disturbing, shocking, upsetting statement that none of the models and none of the paths |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=133) |  is very good is, for me, a huge positive. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=138) |  I wonder if you can guess why. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=142) |  Can you guess? |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=145) |  I think that there is a lot about enlightenment that is not known and is important. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=158) |  I think that no living teacher knows very much about enlightenment, even the deeply |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=173) |  enlightened teachers, and I think that no teacher of the past knew very much about enlightenment, |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=180) |  perhaps. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=182) |  There may be, and probably is, just a lot that could not be known within the limited |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=195) |  confines of pre-scientific culture, the pre-scientific view of things. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=203) |  Now that we live in a scientific culture, we can start to look at dimensions of enlightenment |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=214) |  that none of the masters of the past could have thought of. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=219) |  And I suspect, although I cannot know for sure, I can conjecture, and I don't think |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=224) |  it's an unreasonable conjecture, that we will discover radically innovative dimensions of |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=235) |  enlightenment that are very, very important. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=241) |  Assuming there's no catastrophic collapse of human culture for the next many centuries, |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=250) |  I think it is highly probable that a vastly improved science and technology of enlightenment |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=262) |  will be discovered by humanity. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=266) |  So for now, given that none of us teachers is very good, and that none of our maps are |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=277) |  very good, that may take a little bit of the pressure off of you in terms of finding the |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=285) |  best teacher and the best map. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=289) |  The best of what's not very good, we have to be humble about that. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=295) |  All of us teachers, no matter what their depth of personal enlightenment, have to be very |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=302) |  humble. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=305) |  In science, this is how it works. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=309) |  You make a theory, and it has certain implications. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=316) |  You then do experiments, or you observe and you see, well, did those things that this |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=323) |  theory implied happen? |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=326) |  If they didn't, then you have to modify or reject the theory. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=331) |  Actually it's not so much a rejecting as an improving process. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=341) |  A really good map of enlightenment would make enlightenment readily available to great masses |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=358) |  of human beings. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=362) |  Essentially anyone on the planet with informed consent, who had an idea of what it was and |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=369) |  thought they wanted this, should be able to have it if we had a best map and a best technology. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=378) |  The fact that this doesn't happen, to me, indicates that we've got a long way to go, |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=383) |  and that's a huge positive. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=385) |  Because if what someone in India discovered 2,500 years ago is the last word, the best, |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=394) |  and cannot be dramatically evolved from, then we're really screwed up. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=404) |  We're in bad shape. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=406) |  I know the Buddhist tradition says, well, it is the best, it's just that the nature |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=411) |  of our impurities is so deep and we have all this reincarnation and it takes a gazillion |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=417) |  lifetimes, etc., etc. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=418) |  I would say that could be the case. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=421) |  But to tell you the truth, I don't see any compelling evidence that that is the case. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=428) |  My gut tells me, as a modern person, a skeptical modern person, my gut tells me that we can |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=441) |  do a lot better. |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=444) |  And my own teacher, who is very traditional, Sasaki Roshi, has said that each generation |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=450) |  of enlightened masters must improve the work of the previous generation. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=456) |  So I don't just come, you know, it's not just an idea that I came upon on my own. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=461) |  And he said science is the model. |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=463) |  Science gets better and better. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=465) |  So what's the best map? |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=468) |  Well, if you're young enough, maybe you will live to hear about the best map. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=475) |  And that's what gets me up every morning. |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=480) |  That's what I live for. |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=481) |  What can I do to nourish the soil in which the next lotus of enlightenment for the planet |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whnGgq4O3jM&t=492) |  will arise? |

     Is there a best model or map for the various stages of the spiritual path, including classical enlightenment and all of its ramifications, the places, the directions that you grow from it?
