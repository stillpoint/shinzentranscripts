    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=0) |  The idea of manifesting was described by some of the Neoplatonists as |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=29) |  from the good to the good, never leaving the good. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=35) |  And there's a metaphor of a fountain that gushes out, gathers back at the same time. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=45) |  If you look at your central nervous system, the functional anatomy, |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=51) |  there's something right in the center of your brain called the corona radiata. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=56) |  And it looks like a fountain. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=60) |  And the sensory fibers go up and the motor fibers come down, roughly speaking. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=68) |  I suspect that this is not a coincidence. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=72) |  So from the good back to the good, never leaving the good. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=78) |  You expand and contract simultaneously, but the entire thing is surrounded by zero. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=88) |  So although there is contrast, there is no birth. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=94) |  Ironically, by utterly giving yourself to life and death, |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=99) |  you abide in a transcendence of life and death. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=106) |  You are literally born into the unborn. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=111) |  And just like someone who's born into life doesn't know the rules, |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=117) |  doesn't know the lay of the land, it takes many years for the no-self, |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=124) |  the unborn, to learn how to carry on all of the functions of the self-self. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=134) |  There's some pictures called the Zen ox-herding pictures |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=138) |  that portray that on the metaphor of training an ox. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=142) |  Time and space arise by the arising of what inhabits time and space, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=146) |  which is our subjective world of field image talk |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=149) |  and our so-called objective world of touch-site sound. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=153) |  Now by utterly giving yourself to whatever wants to say yes |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=159) |  and whatever wants to say no, |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=162) |  by utterly giving yourself to whatever pushes out and whatever pulls in, |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=168) |  however uncomfortable that may be for a while, |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=173) |  we get a little bit of the cosmic affirmation |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=180) |  and a little bit of the cosmic negation, |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=183) |  just a tiny little fraction of it. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=185) |  This is the way Sasaki Roshi teaches. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=188) |  So we give that tiny fraction back to the rest of the universe, |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=194) |  the totality of expansion and the totality of contraction, |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=198) |  and then our tiny little bit merges with the totality |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=204) |  and there's no somethingness to prevent expansion and contraction |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=211) |  from re-merging, coming back together into the one zero. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=218) |  And to experience this cycle over and over again, |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=222) |  as you look to the right, look to the left, talk to this person, |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=225) |  think about this, do that, plan dinner, eat dinner, make love, make arguments, |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=235) |  to not lose track that this is happening |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=241) |  would be tantamount to what might be called living nirvana. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=245) |  I spoke about how flow can integrate the mind and the body. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=251) |  I spoke about how flow can integrate inside and outside. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=257) |  But mind and body, inside and outside, can be integrated in the sense of |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=267) |  never disconnected from the source, the zero, the balance point, the one nothing, |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=274) |  the fulfilling vacuity. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=281) |  It's this word nirvana, we can't translate it into English. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=286) |  It means both cessation and complete fulfillment, because it's quenching. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=294) |  The fire is quenched, the fire of suffering is quenched, |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=298) |  but your thirst is quenched, meaning that you have fulfillment, |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=307) |  and not just a little bit of fulfillment, but a kind of utter fulfillment |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=313) |  for no reason whatsoever, happiness independent of conditions. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=317) |  Sukhihoto, may you be happy, is the traditional greeting in Theravada Buddhism, |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=323) |  in the Pali language, happy in the sense of good things happen to you, |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=328) |  and happy in the sense that your happiness is not dependent on good things happening to you. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=334) |  Both of these connotations are present when people say sukhihoto. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=339) |  Ironically, by being able to, in a sense, abstract, in a sense, see that all change |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=354) |  can be in some way looked upon as an interplay of oppositely directed doings, |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=363) |  and then by seeing that they all boil down to yang and yin, yes and no, life and death, |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=373) |  expansion and contraction, moving forward, moving backward, etc., etc., |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=382) |  you surrender to life and death, and you're torn apart. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=388) |  But don't worry, all that happens is you become life and death. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=393) |  I didn't make this phraseology up, this is verbatim Sasaki Roshi's taisho. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=399) |  He says, I know it's scary to think of completely surrendering to expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=408) |  It's scary to consider allowing yourself to literally be torn apart by the forces of nature. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=419) |  But don't be scared. All that's going to happen is when you surrender to life and death, |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=426) |  you will become life and death. They will no longer be an object for you, |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=432) |  and therefore you will become free from life and death. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=435) |  You will become that which is beyond life and death, |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=438) |  because life and death will rebalance, will reunite into the still point of the turning world, |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=446) |  neither life nor death, neither movement from nor towards. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=449) |  This could also be described as absolute present, future and past uniting |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=456) |  in an absolute presence that has no duration whatsoever. |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPWNtGgp6A&t=463) |  Spatially paper-thin, temporally instantaneous. |

     The idea of manifesting was described by some of the Neoplatonists as from the good to the good, never leaving the good.
