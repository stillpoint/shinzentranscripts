    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=0) |  I'm speaking with Shinzen Yang, an internationally recognized teacher of mindfulness meditation. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=21) |  Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, Shinzen. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=23) |  My pleasure. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=24) |  I'm interested in your recommendations for women who have been newly diagnosed with breast |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=30) |  cancer or are recovering from breast cancer in terms of a meditation technique that may |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=35) |  help them both to recover as much as possible from the disease and help them to heal in |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=43) |  general. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=44) |  What would your recommendations be? |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=47) |  There is a vast range of possible ways that you can focus your attention to deal with |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=57) |  the situation of having breast cancer. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=63) |  The way I like to analyze that situation is first to frame it within a broader context. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=72) |  What's true of breast cancer would be true actually of any kind of cancer. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=78) |  What's true of any kind of cancer would be true of any disease or health situation, including |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=87) |  an injury if you were injured and had to go to the hospital. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=91) |  In general, when one is facing some sort of health crisis of any kind, there are two broad |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=103) |  ways that people use meditation to deal with that. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=110) |  Those are not mutually exclusive. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=114) |  One can do one, the other, or both, but I think it is important to realize the relationships |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=123) |  between them and what they are. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=126) |  One way of meditating, and by meditating I just mean focusing in some systematic way. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=133) |  That's all I mean by meditating. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=136) |  One way to meditate or focus in a systematic way has as its goal to influence the objective |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=144) |  course of the healing, objectively. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=148) |  We want to diminish the cancer. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=151) |  We want to heal the wound quickly and so forth. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=155) |  I call that impacting the objective course of the healing. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=162) |  There are a wide range of procedures, different kinds of focuses, that are aimed at that goal. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=173) |  In our discussion before we started taping this interview, you talked about a number |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=179) |  of approaches that you had studied that have history and background and so forth. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=185) |  If we look at them, as I recall back, some of them were specifically aimed at, okay, |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=193) |  there's going to be healing. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=194) |  There's going to be an actual change in your situation. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=198) |  The cancer is going to get smaller or something like that. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=201) |  Can you remind me what some of the approaches that were sort of along those lines are? |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=206) |  One of the approaches was the approach of Bill Bengston, who worked with mice and humans, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=214) |  but he tried to teach university students how to heal cancers, tumors, and mice, and |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=219) |  found that when those students were creating images in their minds of positive things that |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=226) |  they wanted in their lives, and one of those images also being that all of the mice were |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=231) |  cured and that they were toasting a glass of champagne together because all of the mice |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=235) |  were cured, that that imaging and the repetitions of those images as they were holding the mice |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=241) |  for an hour a day in a cage allowed them to actually, unbeknownst to them, cure those |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=246) |  mice after about a month's time. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=248) |  They thought at the end of the experiment that the experiment was a gullibility experiment, |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=253) |  that every few days new mice were put in the cage who had smaller tumors, and they, at |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=258) |  the end of the experiment, didn't believe actually that they had cured the mice, but |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=261) |  it was their mental state at the time that seemed to have influenced the healing with |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=266) |  those positive images they had. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=268) |  And this was an intentional creation of images. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=271) |  Right. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=272) |  Right. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=273) |  Okay, very good. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=275) |  So that would be the goal. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=278) |  Are there other procedures that you can think of historically where the goal has been to |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=286) |  change the object of course? |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=287) |  Well, the Dr. Mears, Ainsley Mears from Australia, he worked in the 1970s with his patients with |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=296) |  meditation techniques for cancer. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=299) |  He was also a medical hypnotist. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=301) |  And his technique was to create a sense of relaxation, to have the patient create a strong |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=307) |  relaxation state, a stillness of mind, an observation of thought, and a very quiet, |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=313) |  quietening process of the mind without any real imaging of, you know, I'm going to cure |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=320) |  this disease. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=321) |  A change, right. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=322) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=323) |  It was just to create this place of deep stillness. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=325) |  And he seems to have had a 10% success rate in curing cancer. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=329) |  When this was presented to people, was it presented as if you do this, it will have |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=337) |  an impact on, positive impact on your cancer? |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=341) |  That was sort of the stated goal. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=345) |  I know that while they were doing the meditation, they were not to focus on that in their mind. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=350) |  I think though that he became known at the time for this technique that was helping some |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=355) |  people cure cancer. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=356) |  So the implication is if you do this calming and observing technique. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=361) |  It may happen. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=362) |  What I would say is that, and I know that there's some other methods, one that I think |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=367) |  you don't think very highly of where you try to visualize like Pac-Man eating up the… |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=373) |  Yes. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=374) |  And in fact, Dr. Mears, one of his patients shrank her tumor by doing his technique about |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=381) |  becoming completely still and quiet and relaxed. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=385) |  And he advised his patients to practice for an hour or two a day, actually. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=390) |  It was a long period of time. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=392) |  By the way, that is a significant point. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=394) |  Yes. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=395) |  We're talking about a quick fix, trivial. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=399) |  But you want a significant change, you may have to put in a significant time and energy. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=405) |  And one of his patients practiced his technique, shrank her tumor, and then tried the Simonton |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=410) |  technique of actually visualizing the cancer shrinking, visualizing the white blood cells |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=415) |  attacking the cancer cells. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=416) |  Eating it like Pac-Man. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=417) |  And while she did that, the tumor came back. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=420) |  And then she abandoned that technique upon his recommendation, went back to the stilling, |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=424) |  quieting technique, and the tumor shrank again. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=426) |  So that's a very interesting case. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=429) |  Very good. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=430) |  When we look at the range of things out there, very often what will be talked about is, okay, |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=438) |  if you focus in this way, it's going to cure your cancer or it's likely to cure |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=445) |  your cancer or it's going to help bring an objective change in the situation. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=451) |  So I would consider that to be one basic model. |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=459) |  There's another paradigm, another way to look at things, that complements that and can be |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=468) |  used in parallel or perhaps in lieu of this, what we're talking about. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=476) |  The other paradigm says, my interest in learning this meditation technique is primarily to |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=486) |  reduce the suffering that I experience due to this situation. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=492) |  And it may or may not have an objective impact, but it has a high probability of reducing |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=503) |  the suffering, whether it has an objective impact or not. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=507) |  I think both approaches are equally valid. |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=510) |  But my sort of go-to approach personally, if I have to teach one or the other, is I'm |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=516) |  going to teach you ways of focusing that will reduce your suffering. |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=520) |  The reason for that is several fold. |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=526) |  First, in a lot of the models that you and I talked about, the claim is that in fact |
    | [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=536) |  the objective condition of the cancer has been caused by mental or emotional distress. |
    | [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=545) |  That's a claim. |
    | [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=546) |  I'm not going to comment on the validity of that claim, but that's commonly believed |
    | [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=552) |  and even in standard medicine. |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=553) |  Certainly it can be a contributing cause, maybe not the whole cause. |
    | [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=557) |  I believe I could be wrong about this, but I think that the official position of the |
    | [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=562) |  AMA, the American Medical Association, is that mental and emotional factors weigh in, |
    | [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=569) |  in one way or another. |
    | [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=571) |  And that's established medicine. |
    | [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=575) |  To whatever extent the objective situation is actually the result of suffering—mental, |
    | [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=583) |  emotional, what have you—to that extent, if we reduce suffering, then there'll be |
    | [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwSAR8BF9Y&t=590) |  an impact on the objective situation. |

     I'm speaking with Shinzen Yang, an internationally recognized teacher of mindfulness meditation. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, Shinzen. My pleasure. I'm interested in your recommendations for women who have been newly diagnosed with breast cancer or are recovering from breast cancer in terms of a meditation technique that may help them both to recover as much as possible from the disease and help them to heal in general. What would your recommendations be? There is a vast range of possible ways that you can focus your attention to deal with the situation of having breast cancer. The way I like to analyze that situation is first to frame it within a broader context. What's true of breast cancer would be true actually of any kind of cancer. What's true of any kind of cancer would be true of any disease or health situation, including an injury if you were injured and had to go to the hospital. In general, when one is facing some sort of health crisis of any kind, there are two broad ways that people use meditation to deal with that. Those are not mutually exclusive. One can do one, the other, or both, but I think it is important to realize the relationships between them and what they are. One way of meditating, and by meditating I just mean focusing in some systematic way. That's all I mean by meditating. One way to meditate or focus in a systematic way has as its goal to influence the objective course of the healing, objectively. We want to diminish the cancer. We want to heal the wound quickly and so forth. I call that impacting the objective course of the healing. There are a wide range of procedures, different kinds of focuses, that are aimed at that goal. In our discussion before we started taping this interview, you talked about a number of approaches that you had studied that have history and background and so forth. If we look at them, as I recall back, some of them were specifically aimed at, okay, there's going to be healing. There's going to be an actual change in your situation. The cancer is going to get smaller or something like that. Can you remind me what some of the approaches that were sort of along those lines are? One of the approaches was the approach of Bill Bengston, who worked with mice and humans, but he tried to teach university students how to heal cancers, tumors, and mice, and found that when those students were creating images in their minds of positive things that they wanted in their lives, and one of those images also being that all of the mice were cured and that they were toasting a glass of champagne together because all of the mice were cured, that that imaging and the repetitions of those images as they were holding the mice for an hour a day in a cage allowed them to actually, unbeknownst to them, cure those mice after about a month's time. They thought at the end of the experiment that the experiment was a gullibility experiment, that every few days new mice were put in the cage who had smaller tumors, and they, at the end of the experiment, didn't believe actually that they had cured the mice, but it was their mental state at the time that seemed to have influenced the healing with those positive images they had. And this was an intentional creation of images. Right. Right. Okay, very good. So that would be the goal. Are there other procedures that you can think of historically where the goal has been to change the object of course? Well, the Dr. Mears, Ainsley Mears from Australia, he worked in the 1970s with his patients with meditation techniques for cancer. He was also a medical hypnotist. And his technique was to create a sense of relaxation, to have the patient create a strong relaxation state, a stillness of mind, an observation of thought, and a very quiet, quietening process of the mind without any real imaging of, you know, I'm going to cure this disease.

And one of his patients practiced his technique, shrank her tumor, and then tried the Simonton technique of actually visualizing the cancer shrinking, visualizing the white blood cells attacking the cancer cells. Eating it like Pac-Man. And while she did that, the tumor came back. And then she abandoned that technique upon his recommendation, went back to the stilling, quieting technique, and the tumor shrank again. So that's a very interesting case. Very good. When we look at the range of things out there, very often what will be talked about is, okay, if you focus in this way, it's going to cure your cancer or it's likely to cure your cancer or it's going to help bring an objective change in the situation. So I would consider that to be one basic model. There's another paradigm, another way to look at things, that complements that and can be used in parallel or perhaps in lieu of this, what we're talking about. The other paradigm says, my interest in learning this meditation technique is primarily to reduce the suffering that I experience due to this situation. And it may or may not have an objective impact, but it has a high probability of reducing the suffering, whether it has an objective impact or not. I think both approaches are equally valid. But my sort of go-to approach personally, if I have to teach one or the other, is I'm going to teach you ways of focusing that will reduce your suffering. The reason for that is several fold. First, in a lot of the models that you and I talked about, the claim is that in fact the objective condition of the cancer has been caused by mental or emotional distress. That's a claim. I'm not going to comment on the validity of that claim, but that's commonly believed and even in standard medicine. Certainly it can be a contributing cause, maybe not the whole cause. I believe I could be wrong about this, but I think that the official position of the AMA, the American Medical Association, is that mental and emotional factors weigh in, in one way or another. And that's established medicine. To whatever extent the objective situation is actually the result of suffering—mental, emotional, what have you—to that extent, if we reduce suffering, then there'll be an impact on the objective situation.
