    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=0) |  What is the meaning of the word soul? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=7) |  I will sometimes use the word soul. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=12) |  When I do, I am referring to essentially one's subjective world, |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=23) |  the world of feel, image and talk, |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=27) |  considered in terms of its deepest layers. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=34) |  In other words, when you work with your subjective experience, |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=40) |  a practice that I call focus in, |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=44) |  you can track the surface of your subjective experience |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=49) |  in terms of explicit mental pictures |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=53) |  which tend to center in front of or behind your eyes, |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=57) |  internal talk which tends to center in your ears |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=61) |  or in your head somewhere, maybe symmetrical, maybe asymmetrical, |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=66) |  and then emotional type body sensations. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=69) |  So the emotional type body sensations, if they're present, |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=73) |  I say that feel is active, so you have feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=78) |  So you can track your subjective world of thought, emotion, reaction, desire, and so forth, |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=87) |  will, in terms of on the surface feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=93) |  As the surface feel, image, talk sort of plays itself out, |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=99) |  you become aware that underneath that explicit feel, image, talk |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=105) |  are subtler and subtler and subtler levels of similar stuff, |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=113) |  but it's finer and more widespread. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=118) |  So there's layers of subtle image activity |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=123) |  underneath the surface image activity, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=126) |  likewise with talk, likewise with feel. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=130) |  In fact, even when there doesn't seem to be any explicit talk going on, |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=135) |  you can sort of hear a rumbling of subtle activity in talk space. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=142) |  Same with sort of like snow on your mental screen, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=147) |  a rumbling deep down in image space. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=150) |  And in your emotional centers in your body, |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=154) |  it's like the circuits there are idling, |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=158) |  like the wheels are turning but the clutch is not engaged, |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=165) |  so you're not emotionally going anywhere. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=168) |  So there are these subtle levels of association and processing |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=173) |  that are fine but broad. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=177) |  I will sometimes loosely, in a sort of colloquial way, |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=182) |  refer to those more subtle, deep levels of feel, image, talk activity as soul. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=190) |  For example, when you get a sense that material is being released, |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=195) |  that the blockages within the depths of fit space are working their way out, |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=203) |  I'll sometimes poetically say that the thorns are being sort of plucked out of your soul |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=210) |  or the lumps in your soul are being worked through. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=214) |  Here I'm just using soul poetically, |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=217) |  not in any theological or well-defined psychological sense, |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=224) |  to refer to the deeper, more subliminal levels of feel, image, talk activity. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=231) |  One of the reasons that it's so challenging to untangle the feel, image, talk |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=237) |  is that it's not a one-scale system. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=243) |  On the other hand, it is definitely not an infinite mathematical fractal |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=248) |  where you can drill down endlessly into subtlety. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=254) |  How many layers down are there? I have no idea. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=260) |  Some have postulated up to four layers in terms of the Yogacara school. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=266) |  For example, in India, but who knows, maybe there's more. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=272) |  This awaits a true neuron-based, neuroanatomy-based science model for these systems. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=282) |  I don't know how many layers there are down there, but it's maybe a half dozen, this is a guess. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=289) |  Certainly not infinite, literally, although it seems to us infinite, |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=296) |  because each one is exponentially both bigger and finer than its predecessors. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=305) |  So it seems to point to infinity, but that's just an optical illusion. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=311) |  It's finite as far as I can tell, and when you get to the base of the iceberg, so to speak, |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=321) |  you'll find that it is floating in the ocean of pure spirit. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=327) |  So don't have to worry. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=329) |  One of the things that makes it so challenging to untangle the fit system |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=335) |  is that the tangling is at all those levels. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=338) |  But eventually it all sort of unwinds, the skein unwinds, and things become very, very simple. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K50i1AYPl7w&t=347) |  And when that happens, we could say that the true beauty of your soul has been manifested. |
