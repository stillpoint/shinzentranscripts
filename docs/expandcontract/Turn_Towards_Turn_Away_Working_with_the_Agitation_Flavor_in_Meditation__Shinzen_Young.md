    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=0) |  Meditation Practice |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=7) |  Sometimes when we do meditation practice, we experience calm and tranquil states. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=14) |  But sometimes when we do meditation practice, we experience agitation, impatience, restlessness, and so forth. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=22) |  There's a tendency to think when that kind of thing arises that I'm doing something wrong, that it's not okay. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=32) |  I would say that not only is it okay, but actually it's quite natural. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=38) |  An experience of restlessness in the body is a certain flavor of emotional experience in the body. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=48) |  I use the word feel to refer to body sensations that seem to a person at a given time to be emotional in nature. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=60) |  And I have a sort of list of common flavors of feel that come up for people. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=66) |  The biggest uncomfortable ones are anger, fear, sadness, shame, slash embarrassment. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=75) |  But right after the big four comes what I call agitation or impatience. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=83) |  Now it may not be dramatic like anger, fear, sadness, and shame, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=90) |  but the don't want to sit still, antsy kind of feel is very significant because it informs the day-to-day life of everyone. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=102) |  Most people are hopefully not living on a day-to-day basis with rage, terror, grief, and shame flavors in their body. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=113) |  But almost everyone experiences, usually below the threshold of awareness, |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=119) |  a kind of subtle agitation, impatience quality in day-to-day life. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=125) |  That's what gives that sense of being driven and frenetic, that inability to stop on a dime. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=143) |  It's primarily due to agitation flavors that sort of drive you. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=149) |  Now, therefore, is the goal to get rid of those agitation flavors? |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=154) |  Well, no, I wouldn't really say quite that. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=158) |  The goal is to be able to have a complete experience of those agitation flavors. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=167) |  What do I mean by a complete experience? |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=171) |  I mean that you experience it with an extraordinary degree of concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=182) |  These are technical terms within the basic mindfulness system that I teach, and I've defined them elsewhere. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=191) |  When you bring enough concentration, clarity, and equanimity to any ordinary experience, it becomes utterly extraordinary. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=200) |  And that includes negative experiences, uncomfortable experiences, like agitation flavor in your body. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=207) |  It's desirable to be able to have a complete experience of the agitation flavor. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=214) |  That doesn't mean, however, that you necessarily have to work with it when it comes up. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=223) |  You may choose to focus away from it. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=226) |  So you're practicing, everything is sort of calm and whatever. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=230) |  You're focusing, I don't know, you're focusing on your breath, for example, your breath sensations. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=238) |  And all this agitation comes up. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=241) |  So what should I do? |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=244) |  Well, one possibility is to just let it be there, but in the background, and you keep bringing your attention back to the breath. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=256) |  But you don't think it's a bad thing that it's there, you don't try to suppress it. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=260) |  You just don't intentionally focus on it. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=263) |  You just keep coming back to your object. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=266) |  Now, I would say that you're not bringing concentration or sensory clarity to the agitation. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=275) |  But you are bringing equanimity to it, even though you're not focusing on it. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=281) |  You're letting it be in the background, you're coming back to the breath. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=285) |  So one strategy would be just let it be there, understand it's a natural thing. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=289) |  You let it be in the background, you keep focusing on what you were focusing on. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=295) |  Another strategy is, okay, let's not turn away from it, let's turn towards it. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=302) |  Then you would be bringing three things to it. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=306) |  You would be accepting it as a flavor in your body, so that's the equanimity piece. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=310) |  But you were doing that before, hopefully, that was already helping a little bit. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=315) |  But now you're bringing concentration and sensory clarity. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=318) |  You're intentionally focusing on it and ignoring other things. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=323) |  And you're trying to be aware of the locations, the changing intensities, and so forth. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=330) |  And as a result of that, that agitation flavor will cause you less and less suffering. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=337) |  And as it causes you less and less suffering, it will less and less drive your behavior in day-to-day life. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=345) |  In general, when a challenge comes up, one has the option to either turn towards it |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=354) |  and work with it as an object of focus, |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=358) |  or one has the option to just let it be in the background and stay with what you were originally doing. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=364) |  You can learn something from both ways of working. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=368) |  And I usually encourage people to explore both possibilities. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=372) |  That gives you flexibility. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=375) |  The price of flexibility, though, is complexity. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=378) |  I've mentioned that one of the weak points of my approach to meditation practice is |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=385) |  that I give people a lot of options that also could be taken as a strong point, of course. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=390) |  So I give people ways of turning their attention away from challenges, |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=395) |  onto restful states or positive states or the energy flow of the experience and so forth. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=407) |  But I also give people ways of bringing their attention towards the challenge |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=412) |  and accepting it as an object, perhaps solidified, uncomfortable, objectified, |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=418) |  and then their opening to it, turning their attention towards the challenge. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=423) |  If, when you're practicing, the agitation flavor comes up, it's certainly not a problem. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=432) |  It's certainly okay. In fact, it's totally natural that that's going to happen from time to time. |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=437) |  What to do about it? Well, there's a lot of things you could do, and they're all good. |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=443) |  What should you do? Should you turn towards it? Should you turn away from it? |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=448) |  Well, I would say it's desirable to have the ability to do either approach, |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKfkNWDG170&t=454) |  because both are legitimate and both are productive. |
