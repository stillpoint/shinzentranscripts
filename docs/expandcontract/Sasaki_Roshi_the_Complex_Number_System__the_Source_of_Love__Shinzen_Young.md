    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=0) |  Sasaki Roshi makes a lot more claims about his paradigm than I do. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=12) |  He may be right. I only claim it's a useful way to analyze how consciousness works moment |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=19) |  by moment. He implies that it's more than that, that it's a universal grand theory of |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=26) |  everything. You can look at everything that is in terms of a paradigm of mutually contrasting |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=38) |  activities that can cancel into a neutral, and a neutral that can cancel into a neutral |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=45) |  and a neutral that can polarize into mutually contrasting activities. He says this is sort |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=52) |  of like the way everything works. It is not inconceivable that in a hundred years, two |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=61) |  hundred years, a thousand years, whenever, finally a single unified grand theory of everything |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=68) |  is hit upon, that it turns out to have something to do with binary contrasts that can cancel. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=80) |  There's some hint that that might be the case because so far our best model for everything |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=87) |  is the complex number system, our modern concept of number. And the complex number system consists |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=94) |  of three types of contrast, each one of which can neutralize to a non-contrasting state. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=101) |  There's the multiplicative domain, which is a stretch-squeeze thing. You stretch-squeeze, |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=116) |  or nothing moves, which is one, multiplied by one. Or you can multiply by a number whose |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=123) |  absolute value is less than one, that will squeeze things. You can multiply by a number |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=128) |  whose absolute value is greater than one, that will stretch things. But if you multiply |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=133) |  by one, it's a neutral element. Then you have the additive domain, where you can move to |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=140) |  the right, move to the left, or not move at all, or front, back, top, bottom, or any direction |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=147) |  of any vector. Well, in the complex plane it's a two-dimensional thing. In other words, |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=153) |  move in one direction, move oppositely in that direction, they cancel out. That's additive |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=160) |  zero. And then there's a rotational component in the complex numbers, where you can turn |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=167) |  to the right, turn to the left, or not turn at all. T.S. Eliot talks about the spirit |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=175) |  as the dance. Except for the point, the still point, there would be no dance. And there |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=185) |  is only the dance. If you look at a dancer, what do they do? Like Martha Grant writes, |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=193) |  stretch your arms out, bring your arms in, okay, this sort of stretch-squeeze, but they |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=199) |  also move up, move down, they jump, they move to the right, they move to the left, they |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=204) |  turn to the right, turn to the left. All the actions of the dancer are actually quantified |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=211) |  with our modern concept of number. Also, it turns out that the quantum weirdness is in |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=219) |  a sense a consequence of our modern kinds of numbers, the complex, what are called the |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=225) |  complex numbers. The waves that are complex waves allow for these weird things to happen. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=233) |  Among them, something coming from nothing, which is rather extraordinary. The neutral |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=241) |  state can be a source of polarized something. It is possible that he's right. Who knows? |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=256) |  Only time will tell. But the fact that our number system seems to be built on binary |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=263) |  contrast that can neutralize three different flavors of them, actually, the fact that he |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=268) |  says consciousness is this contrasting, neutralizing activity, could be that this is pointing towards |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=278) |  a grand theory of everything. The whole point in experiencing this is that it's analogous |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=291) |  to the peristalsis of a formless womb. And as you begin to experience yourself and the |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=305) |  world coming from this doing and returning to this doing, even though the doing is impersonal |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=318) |  and empty, it's also a source of unconditional love. When we contact it, it has that effect |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvFOe_JmSCw&t=334) |  on the human part of us. And we naturally from that want to serve. |
