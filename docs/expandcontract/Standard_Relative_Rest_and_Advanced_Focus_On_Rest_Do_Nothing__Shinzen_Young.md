    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=0) |  One of my pet phrases is, when you say, nothing is happening as I'm sitting there, either |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=10) |  literally nothing is happening, in which case you are in cessation. You're in nirvana itself. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=21) |  And that's great. Or, that's not the case. In which case six things are happening in |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=28) |  your body. Your body is physically relaxed, your eyes are defocused, your ears are defocused, |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=33) |  your body is emotionally neutral, your mental screen is blank, and your head is quiet. That's |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=39) |  six sensory events are going on. If you pay attention to those as tangible events, then |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=46) |  something is happening when nothing much is happening. And that brings a clarity component |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=52) |  into the experience of nothing much is happening. And guess what? That will now tend to bring |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=58) |  a growth component back into the big picture of your practice. The absorption jhana shamatha |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=66) |  practice, as it's described, represents a thinning out of self and world. What is thin |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=73) |  is penetratable. You go into these absorption states and then you penetrate the restful |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=84) |  factors, or the jhanic factors, for me it's restful factors. The awareness soaks into |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=89) |  them and what do they become? Flow and go. They break up into vibrating points. So there's |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=96) |  what's called sukha vipassana, which is dry vipassana, where if we put it into my language, |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=105) |  you go directly from touch, sight, sound, or feel, image, talk, you do a direct penetration |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=113) |  and it dissolves into vibrating void. That's called dry vipassana. Or there's the absorption |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=120) |  path, where you get things all thinned out, in once again my personal language, instead |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=128) |  of touch, sight, sound, it's relaxation, light, silence. Instead of feel, image, talk, it's |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=133) |  peace, blank, quiet. Then you penetrate those into flow and go, because they're more easily |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=139) |  penetrated, because they're more thinned out. But either way, gets you to the same results. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=145) |  So focus on change, once again, enters in when you do the vipassana, what are called |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=152) |  the vipassana jhanas, where you're penetrating the jhanic factors. So that's why I have to |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=158) |  focus on change. Focus on rest, as I like to teach it to people. There are two sort |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=165) |  of ways of doing it. The standard way that I just described, working with restful flavors. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=176) |  And then there's the advanced version of focus on rest, which I call do nothing. But I have |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=182) |  a very clear definition of what it means to do nothing. Do nothing isn't twiddle your |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=188) |  thumbs and let your mind wander. There's a certain way to do nothing that allows you |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=194) |  to do that, to have that be a growth experience. And the do nothing is my reworking, once again, |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=204) |  a reworking. I don't claim these are the same thing. It's modified, reworked. But it's my |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=210) |  reworking of the whole bundle of approaches that we find worldwide that might be described |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=217) |  as anti-meditation. In the sense that instead of making an effort, instead of engaging in |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=230) |  the noble quest, you, in the words of one of the teachers in that tradition, Papaji, |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=237) |  you call off the search. I love that phrase, call off the search. You stop trying to meditate. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=248) |  And you stop trying to do anything and you just abide without trying. You come to abide |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=258) |  in the nature of consciousness. In the Tibetan tradition, this is Dzogchen and Mahamudra. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=269) |  In terms of Zen, some of the early Zen tranquil illumination schools of Zen where they wouldn't, |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=277) |  they just like, it was a non-doing, some interpretations of just sitting, some interpretations of choiceless |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=283) |  awareness, some interpretations of non-dual awareness sort of work this way. As I mentioned, |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=291) |  there's two sides to the path and it's paradoxical. There's a place for bearing down, there's |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=298) |  a place for easing up, there's a place for doing something and there's a place for not |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=306) |  doing anything at all. So the not doing anything at all I call deny. If I had to say what's |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=317) |  my model in it, it's Dzogchen as I understand it, which admittedly I'm certainly not a scholar |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=325) |  or a deep practitioner of that tradition, but I have some sense of what it's about and |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=331) |  I use my own categories and sort of made something that is based on their themes. They talk about |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=341) |  the spacious nature of consciousness, but they also talk about the effortless, spontaneous, |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=349) |  dynamic nature of consciousness. I take that effortless, dynamic nature of consciousness |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=357) |  to be the flow aspect. Even within the sort of do-nothing approach, you're certainly not |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=373) |  meditating on change, you're not doing focus on change, but the fact is as you come to |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=381) |  abide in the spacious nature of consciousness, the dynamism of that spacious nature presents |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=389) |  itself to you as effortless expansion and contraction. So even the do-nothing is not |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nco9isReoA&t=398) |  totally unrelated to the themes of focus on change. |
