    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=0) |  There is a famous scripture which serves as a Buddhist FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=16) |  document or might be in some ways looked upon as a Buddhist catechism. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=22) |  And it's called the Questions of King Melinda. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=26) |  It's in the Pali literature. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=28) |  Melinda was a historical person. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=33) |  And interestingly enough, although his questions are recorded in Buddhist literature preserved |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=41) |  in Southeast Asia, King Melinda was a westerner. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=47) |  He was King Menandros, who was part of what was left in Northwest India after Alexander |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=57) |  the Great died. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=60) |  There were these Greek rulers. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=64) |  We say India, but this is India in its broadest sense. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=68) |  It would now be part of Afghanistan, actually, Bactria, where his kingdom was centered. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=75) |  This is a sort of early dialogue between East and West. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=80) |  Because he asks a series of questions to a Buddhist monk named Nagasena. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=87) |  Before this whole discussion starts, Nagasena asks the king, are you willing to have a discussion |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=95) |  with me and perhaps have disagreements and whatever, and even debate? |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=100) |  Are you willing to do it the way an academic would do it? |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=107) |  Or are you going to do it the way a king would do it? |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=112) |  And Nagasena says, what do you mean? |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=114) |  He said, well, if academics have a disagreement and one sort of gets the better of the other |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=119) |  or shows them to be incorrect, it's just, you know, they just accept that. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=125) |  If a king is shown to be incorrect, he executes you. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=131) |  So which way are you going to do it? |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=135) |  Like an academic or like he's like, you know, because if you're going to do it like a king, |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=138) |  I'm out of here. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=139) |  He may have been an arhat, but he wasn't stupid with regards to the preservation of his low |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=150) |  self by his gandas. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=154) |  So the king says, who are you and whatever? |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=158) |  And he says, well, I'm called Nagasena, but there is no thing called Nagasena. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=163) |  And then the king tries to sort of trip him up on something. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=167) |  And so then Nagasena makes this metaphor that's very famous in Buddhist literature. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=174) |  He says, well, your majesty, when you arrived here, how did you get here? |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=181) |  Well, I was in my chariot. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=184) |  And then he goes through all the different parts of the chariot. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=187) |  And he says, well, is there really a thing called the chariot? |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=192) |  Are the wheels the chariot, the hub, the bed, the axle tree, the yoke, et cetera, et cetera. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=199) |  He goes through all these parts, and the king has to agree, no, that's not the chariot. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=205) |  That's not the chariot. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=206) |  And then Nagasena says, and it's the same with us. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=210) |  There's just rupa, vedana, sanjna, sankhara, and vijnana. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=218) |  That doesn't constitute a self called Nagasena. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=224) |  And the king sort of gets it in this scripture and says, OK, you're right. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=234) |  You win on that one. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=236) |  I guess I can see your point. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=239) |  The point being that chariot as a thing is just a convention. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=246) |  Usually I find the arhat Nagasena's argument unconvincing myself. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=253) |  Does that sound arrogant and irreverent? |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=258) |  If it were really, really, really convincing, then all the philosophers of the world would |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=264) |  be saying, these guys are right. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=267) |  But in fact, there's a lot of philosophical objections to this argument. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=273) |  If you get some professional philosophers in and let them get to work on it, they might |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=280) |  really tear it apart. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=282) |  I think he's right. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=285) |  There is no thing called a self. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=287) |  I'm not just quite sure that this particular metaphor clinches it as a proof, the way it |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=296) |  is portrayed as doing in the scripture. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=300) |  But I would like to clinch it for the world so that there are no quibbles or objections |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=311) |  and everybody agrees. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=313) |  Whoa, yeah, can't deny that. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=316) |  I would like to suggest another angle of attack on this idea. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=325) |  I agree with the idea. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=328) |  I think it is one of the most important ideas in the history of the world. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=335) |  One of the things that is noticeable in this argument is that rupa means the physical body. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=345) |  It's not a sensory experience. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=347) |  We know it exists through a sensory experience, but it's not being presented as a sensory |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=353) |  experience. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=354) |  It's being presented as a concept, body as matter. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=361) |  Samskaras are not direct sensory experiences for most meditators. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=366) |  They can be for some meditators. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=368) |  You can directly experience it. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=371) |  Consciousness as an entity in its own right, as opposed to consciousness in a certain flavor, |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=378) |  such as Tutsite sound-feel-image-talk, that's not ordinarily experienced by most meditators. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=385) |  What if we just take the parts that are direct sensory experience? |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=394) |  Why would we want to do that? |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=395) |  Because well, direct sensory experience as opposed to concepts can be brain-imaged. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=405) |  My idea is let's take either broadly Vedanātami body, that is to say physical and emotional |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=414) |  sensations, so that would be touch-feel, as they do within the Upa-Khin lineage, or let's |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=422) |  really look at the most gripping part of Vedanā, which is the emotional type pleasures and |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=429) |  pains that we go through. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=431) |  Let's take the feel part and let's make sanjna, or concept, not a concept, but a sensory experience, |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=439) |  image-talk. |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=440) |  So let's sort of streamline the model to feel-image-talk. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=450) |  Now I didn't just pull this out of nowhere. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=457) |  There is an implication in my original school of Buddhism, Shingon, which is a form of Vajrayana, |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=467) |  that the sense of self arises through mental image, internal talk, and body sensations, |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=475) |  because the practices that are done in Shingon to have an experience of oneness with the |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=481) |  deity involve the physical type sensations in the form of mudras, mental images where |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=490) |  you visualize the deity in front and also yourself as a deity, and you visualize your |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=496) |  surroundings as the palace of the deity, and you replace your internal talk with the mantra. |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=503) |  And then you get the emotional feeling of the deity, whatever that tone is. |
    | [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=509) |  So there's an implication that body image-talk broadly and feel-image-talk more narrowly, |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=518) |  that these are sort of natural building blocks of identity. |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=524) |  If people tease apart the feel-image-talk, which is, there's nothing conceptual in that, |
    | [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=532) |  that's completely a sensory skill. |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=537) |  They get the same insight, oh, there's just feel-image-talk, there's no thing called a |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=542) |  self here. |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=544) |  So that's the way I have people work with this. |
    | [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=550) |  Now instead of using a classic metaphor of the chariot, I use a much more homey, like |
    | [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=563) |  your TV set or a computer monitor, not the liquid crystal ones, but the CRT ones. |
    | [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZKgyqdiAKI&t=576) |  That's my metaphor. |

     There is a famous scripture which serves as a Buddhist FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, document or might be in some ways looked upon as a Buddhist catechism. And it's called the Questions of King Melinda. It's in the Pali literature. Melinda was a historical person.
