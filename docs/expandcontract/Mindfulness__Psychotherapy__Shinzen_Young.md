    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=0) |  When Buddhism went from India into China, it encountered the indigenous culture of China |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=17) |  and the indigenous philosophies of China through the cross-fertilization of Indic Mahayana |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=27) |  Buddhism and the Taoist-Confucianist culture of China was born a new direction in Buddhism |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=41) |  called Chan or Zen. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=44) |  There's historically precedent for Buddhism coming into a culture and interacting with |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=52) |  what already exists there to produce interesting new results. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=58) |  Now we have Buddhism coming into the Western world, all three vehicles of Buddhism, mindfulness |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=68) |  practice which is representative of the small vehicle, Zen which is representative of the |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=76) |  large vehicle, and the tantric practices which are representative of the diamond vehicle. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=84) |  It's all coming here and we would expect that it would interact with Western culture, many |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=92) |  facets of Western culture. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=94) |  One of them is neuroscience and another one is physics. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=103) |  Those are areas of particular interest. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=106) |  There's also the religious interactions, specifically with Christianity, primarily Catholicism, |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=116) |  and with Judaism now. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=119) |  Then there's the interaction that it is having with psychotherapy. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=125) |  A hundred years ago, William James predicted that within a hundred years, Westerners would |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=135) |  be learning their psychotherapy from Buddhists, an amazing prophetic statement. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=145) |  Because at this point in history, I would say that the dialogue between mindfulness |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=153) |  practice and Western therapy is central to therapy. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=161) |  It's not just some marginal thing that's being done by a few people with special interest. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=168) |  It's the hot topic, which is utterly amazing, because I can remember reading books when |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=176) |  I was a kid in the 50s, books by psychiatrists and so forth, who basically pathologized Buddhist |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=185) |  meditation, considered it to be a form of mental illness. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=190) |  And now, within 50 years, we're talking about major influence from Buddhism into therapy, |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=204) |  especially from mindfulness into therapy, particularly into the more hard-nosed forms |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=212) |  of therapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=215) |  This is just amazing that this is occurring. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=219) |  So it's a natural question. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=222) |  What is the relationship between these two modalities? |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=229) |  It's the question, the central question, that is now being investigated. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=234) |  We don't have the answers yet. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=236) |  But I can make some conjectures. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=239) |  If I had to summarize the difference, with an oversimplification, I would say that in |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=249) |  some sense, Western therapy and mindfulness practice seem to be rather similar. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=259) |  At least if you look at the key concepts and the buzzwords, they're both in favor of being |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=266) |  aware as opposed to being unconscious. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=269) |  They both want you to be aware of the influences from the depths that may be influencing the |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=278) |  surface now. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=279) |  They both ask you not to hold on inappropriately to things from the past, but to move forward |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=289) |  into the present without holding complexes from the past. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=294) |  They both ask you to not be conflicted, not fight with yourself. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=302) |  They both talk about having aha experiences, insight experiences, and so forth. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=309) |  So from a certain perspective, they seem to hold rather similar ideas. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=318) |  Where I would say the primary difference, if I were allowed to oversimplify things, |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=326) |  is that although the ideas are the same, or roughly similar, let's put it this way, mindfulness |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=334) |  practice implements those ideas at a much finer time-space scale and at a much more |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=344) |  intense level. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=347) |  So that mindfulness practice has a quantitative difference, and that quantitative difference |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=361) |  is so great that it leads to a qualitative difference. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=367) |  So similar type things, but done at a very fine time scale, second by second. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=377) |  The holdings that you let go of in mindfulness practice are second by second inappropriate |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=385) |  holdings, as opposed to the holdings that you let go of in psychological practice, which |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=391) |  is from last year or last decade or your early childhood or so forth. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=398) |  Those are sort of macro holdings. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=401) |  Mindfulness asks for letting go of micro holdings. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=405) |  The clarity that you're asked to develop in mindfulness is a moment-by-moment ability |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=412) |  to resolve experiences into feel-image-talk and to resolve the feel into a spectrum of |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=420) |  flavors and resolve the flavors into individual location arisings. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=426) |  It's a whole other level of being aware of what you're experiencing or, quote, knowing |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=437) |  what you're feeling in that moment. |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=439) |  It's like a totally different level of resolution and detail. |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=446) |  And the way of reaching the unconscious differs. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=450) |  Typically in psychotherapy, I call it the dredge-up. |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=453) |  You just approach. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=455) |  You sort of reach down and you dredge up one or two important pivotal things to look at, |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=464) |  whereas in mindfulness practice, it's a trickle-down. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=469) |  The awareness trickles down through all of consciousness and the subconscious rewires |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=475) |  itself without the surface even needing to know, and that's global. |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=480) |  That's throughout the entirety of consciousness. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=484) |  So I would say, roughly speaking, that the basic ideals are the same, but because mindfulness |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=494) |  implements them at a more, a finer scale and with much greater intensity, this is a quantitative |
    | [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=504) |  difference that leads to a qualitative difference. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=507) |  However, the differences are complementary. |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=512) |  One needs to know the brick and mortar structure of the building in addition to knowing the |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=517) |  atomic structure. |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=519) |  If you just know the atomic structure, you don't have the whole picture. |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=523) |  You need to know gross anatomy as well as cellular histology. |
    | [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=530) |  So the two pictures complement. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=534) |  For the large structure of personality and behavior, that's the specialty of psychotherapy. |
    | [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=541) |  For the transcendence of limited existence and suffering, for insight into the nature |
    | [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=549) |  of all selves as opposed to insight into the nature of a particular self, for understanding |
    | [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=558) |  the nature of all self, mindfulness is the specialized vehicle. |
    | [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=566) |  So it's good. |
    | [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=568) |  They complement each other. |
    | [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=570) |  They give different scale picture of the same phenomenon. |
    | [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=577) |  So you get the big picture, the gross anatomy, so to speak, clarified, and the behaviors |
    | [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=584) |  dealt with with the therapy. |
    | [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=587) |  And then you get the microstructure, the spiritual essence, dealt with through the mindfulness, |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghBxjliqIPY&t=593) |  and you have a perfect complementarity. |

     When Buddhism went from India into China, it encountered the indigenous culture of China and the indigenous philosophies of China through the cross-fertilization of Indic Mahayana Buddhism and the Taoist-Confucianist culture of China was born a new direction in Buddhism called Chan or Zen. There's historically precedent for Buddhism coming into a culture and interacting with what already exists there to produce interesting new results. Now we have Buddhism coming into the Western world, all three vehicles of Buddhism, mindfulness practice which is representative of the small vehicle, Zen which is representative of the large vehicle, and the tantric practices which are representative of the diamond vehicle. It's all coming here and we would expect that it would interact with Western culture, many facets of Western culture. One of them is neuroscience and another one is physics. Those are areas of particular interest. There's also the religious interactions, specifically with Christianity, primarily Catholicism, and with Judaism now. Then there's the interaction that it is having with psychotherapy. A hundred years ago, William James predicted that within a hundred years, Westerners would be learning their psychotherapy from Buddhists, an amazing prophetic statement. Because at this point in history, I would say that the dialogue between mindfulness practice and Western therapy is central to therapy. It's not just some marginal thing that's being done by a few people with special interest. It's the hot topic, which is utterly amazing, because I can remember reading books when I was a kid in the 50s, books by psychiatrists and so forth, who basically pathologized Buddhist meditation, considered it to be a form of mental illness.
