    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=0) |  I like to organize the meditation techniques that I teach to people into what I call the |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=14) |  five ways. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=16) |  Five ways are five contrasting approaches to the development of concentration, sensory |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=26) |  clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=29) |  Each of the five ways is derived from one or several traditions that have existed previously, |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=37) |  but what I've done is I've modernized the vocabulary and I have completely eliminated |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=45) |  anything that is explicitly religious from it so that the five ways can be looked upon |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=53) |  as a, shall we say, a way to bring about a secular paradigm for classical enlightenment. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=65) |  The five ways are focus in, focus out, focus on rest, focus on change, and focus on positive. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=80) |  Focus in, the in in this case refers to one's innermost experience of thought and emotion. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=88) |  This is derived from the classic discovery of the Buddha that if you divide the experience |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=98) |  of self into its atomic components, the sense of self as thing and the sense of being trapped |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=107) |  in self as thing disappears. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=111) |  So there are many ways in the Buddhist literature for sort of doing this divide and conquer |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=120) |  on one's I am-ness. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=122) |  I use one that is actually somewhat based on a more Vajrayana point of view, but in |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=130) |  any event, I take as the fundamental elements the somatic component of emotional type body |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=141) |  sensation, the visual component of mental imagery, visual thinking in other words, and |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=147) |  the auditory component of internal talk or conversations. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=152) |  So I have people tease apart the sense of I as controller or I as observer or I as experiencer. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=161) |  I teach you how to break it down into these atoms and then this reduces and eventually |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=169) |  eliminates self as prism, thoughts and emotions as a place you can't escape from but are constrained |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=180) |  to. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=181) |  So that's the focus in approach. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=182) |  As I say, it's essentially based on one of the core innovations of the Buddha, which |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=191) |  is this untangle and be free paradigm. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=200) |  Focus out is based on the Zen way of working. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=204) |  Now there's a lot of aspects to Zen, but one of the aspects is that they would have |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=213) |  to do their practice as they worked. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=215) |  There was a work ethic from Confucianism that infiltrated into the Zen temples. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=224) |  So how are you going to have a deep practice while you're doing physical labor? |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=228) |  One way to do that is you anchor yourself in the external sights, external sounds, and |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=233) |  physical sensations. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=235) |  So by way of contrast to the feel-image-talk of the subjective world, you could let go |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=241) |  of feel-image-talk, let go of the subjective self and anchor yourself in the power of now |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=247) |  as exemplified by touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=251) |  So I call that focus out. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=252) |  That's really useful for practicing life. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=256) |  It was developed, as I say, as part of the Zen curriculum exactly because they were called |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=262) |  upon to do so much practice in daily life activities. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=268) |  So you've got focus in, work with the subjective world, feel-image-talk. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=271) |  You've got focus out, by way of contrast, work with the objective world of touch, sight, |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=278) |  sound. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=279) |  Then you have focus on rest, which I've described in some detail in another talk, which is basically |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=287) |  my reworking of the whole tranquilizing side of contemplative practice. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=293) |  Tranquilizing side of contemplative practice is found all over the world. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=297) |  It's found in the absorption practices of early Buddhism, but it's also found in the |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=304) |  contemplative practices of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and so forth. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=312) |  Traditionally speaking, the word contemplation within the Christian context has two meanings. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=317) |  It is a synonym for meditation, but it's also a special term for deep states of tranquility |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=328) |  that they call the prayer of quiet, but at its extreme end, they called infused contemplation. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=335) |  So I've drawn from the whole world's contemplative traditions, and specifically the absorption |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=343) |  practices of early Buddhism, reformulated that in a completely secular vocabulary, call |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=348) |  it focus on rest, and that's sort of the tranquil side of the practice. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=357) |  So that's focus in, focus out, focus on rest. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=360) |  In ordinary subjective experience, field image talk, ordinary objective experience, touch |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=368) |  sight sound, and these more special, pleasant, restful flavors, all of these experiences |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=381) |  are experiences, and therefore they are of the nature of empty energy. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=388) |  Empty energy doesn't sound very appealing, but it's incredibly empowering and fulfilling |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=396) |  once you start to experience them that way. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=403) |  I teach people how to notice how any and all sensory experience changes, and also along |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=411) |  with that, to be aware of the underlying forces that are responsible for that change. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=417) |  Well, by observing change, both continuous change in the sense of flowing energy and |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=423) |  discontinuous change in the sense of vanishings, that gets us in contact with the energy aspect |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=433) |  and the emptiness, which is the essence of that energy. |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=439) |  So that whole approach to things, which involves impermanence and what the Christians called |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=448) |  kenosis, the emptying out into the source, I call that focus on change. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=457) |  So that's a fourth way. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=460) |  And that will tend to deconstruct the somethingness of self and the materiality of the external |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=469) |  world into a kind of transparent energy. |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=474) |  So you could call that a kind of dying into the source. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=484) |  But if you die, you have to be reborn. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=487) |  And the whole idea of being reborn is to be reborn better, not just to be reborn. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=493) |  So then there's something called focus on positive, where you actively generate positive |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=498) |  content in mental image, internal talk, emotional feel. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=502) |  And that creates a new self. |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=506) |  That new self arises from the nothingness as a better somethingness. |
    | [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=513) |  And that's focus on positive. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SE5O9tjqMo&t=515) |  And so that taken together gives a very complete toolkit for classical enlightenment. |

     I like to organize the meditation techniques that I teach to people into what I call the five ways. Five ways are five contrasting approaches to the development of concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. Each of the five ways is derived from one or several traditions that have existed previously, but what I've done is I've modernized the vocabulary and I have completely eliminated anything that is explicitly religious from it so that the five ways can be looked upon as a, shall we say, a way to bring about a secular paradigm for classical enlightenment. The five ways are focus in, focus out, focus on rest, focus on change, and focus on positive. Focus in, the in in this case refers to one's innermost experience of thought and emotion. This is derived from the classic discovery of the Buddha that if you divide the experience of self into its atomic components, the sense of self as thing and the sense of being trapped in self as thing disappears. So there are many ways in the Buddhist literature for sort of doing this divide and conquer on one's I am-ness. I use one that is actually somewhat based on a more Vajrayana point of view, but in any event, I take as the fundamental elements the somatic component of emotional type body sensation, the visual component of mental imagery, visual thinking in other words, and the auditory component of internal talk or conversations.
