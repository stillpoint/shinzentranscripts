    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=0) |  How do you feel about the lack of informed consent for enlightenment? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=5) |  I sometimes like to somewhat jokingly say that there's no informed consent for enlightenment. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=13) |  People tend to overestimate or underestimate how wonderful the experience is. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=24) |  How wonderful is it? Well, I would say anyone who has entered into the world of no-self, emptiness, and wisdom mind, |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=40) |  who abides in that world, if you give them a choice to live one day knowing what they know, |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=47) |  or live an entire lifetime but not be allowed to know that, I think I can't speak for everyone, |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=57) |  but I would say most people who live in that world would say, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=63) |  I'd rather have one day knowing what I know than a lifetime not being able to know this. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=69) |  So that's how wonderful it is. On the other hand, people tend to overestimate how wonderful it is. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=79) |  People tend to project completely unrealistic fantasies, really, about what enlightened people, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=90) |  enlightened people being, of course, an entire range from initial stream entry all the way up to arhats, |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=102) |  people tend to overestimate what it's like or project things that are completely unrealistic. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=112) |  For example, that if you have some degree of enlightenment you never make mistakes, |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=117) |  or that everything is perfect in your life, or that everything is always bliss and wonderful and so forth. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=128) |  People don't realize there are certain peculiar downsides to enlightenment. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=136) |  For one thing, you can't describe it very well to other people. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=144) |  So it's like you know this secret, you look out and you see the state of humanity, |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=154) |  you know exactly what needs to be done, you know that what needs to be done is doable by anyone, |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=161) |  and you see that people aren't doing it, don't know whether to laugh or cry at the human condition, |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=169) |  and you can't really explain it very well to people. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=175) |  I mean, you can try, and a few people catch on, but it sort of goes in one ear and out the other |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=186) |  for most people that you'll try to talk to about this. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=190) |  So it's like that character out of Greek mythology, I forgot her name, |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=199) |  but the gods gave her this blessing that she could know the future, |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=204) |  but the flip side of that was that no one would believe her. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=210) |  So you sort of know exactly what needs to be done, and you know that it's doable, |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=216) |  but no one believes you, or not very many people believe you. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=222) |  So that's one of the downsides. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=226) |  Another thing is that you get to have all this influence, let's say, |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=235) |  but you don't get to take any credit for it. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=241) |  You don't even know what you're doing. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=243) |  It's like falling off a cliff. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=247) |  Enlightenment is like a free fall. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=253) |  It's like falling off a cliff that never ends, and you've acclimatized to it. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=258) |  That's why the Zen people say it's like riding an ox backwards. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=263) |  So you don't actually know what you're doing, or even what you're saying. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=269) |  When you give your most powerful teachings to people, you don't know what you're saying. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=276) |  You don't even know who you are. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=278) |  You can't take any credit for it whatsoever. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=281) |  It just happens, like a leaf falling from a tree. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=284) |  So it's not like you get to think of yourself as, |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=288) |  well, I'm this cool dude that can do this cool stuff. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=292) |  No, that's not the way it works. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=294) |  So you can't even know or enjoy, in a sense. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoAbCgmhqdM&t=302) |  You just have to occur. |

     How do you feel about the lack of informed consent for enlightenment? I sometimes like to somewhat jokingly say that there's no informed consent for enlightenment.
