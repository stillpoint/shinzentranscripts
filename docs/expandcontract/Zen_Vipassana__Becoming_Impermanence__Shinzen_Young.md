    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=12) |  Impermanence is a kind of energy that is a vital energy that you can learn to ride on. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=20) |  In other words, impermanence is chi. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=26) |  And so the idea in the Zen style of experiencing impermanence is, yes, it's the same deconstructive |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=35) |  thing I described, but then you're also interested not just in form as emptiness, but you're |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=43) |  very interested in how emptiness becomes form, moment by moment, bre-ay yesh me-ayin, to |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=49) |  use the Hebrew Kabbalistic term, how there's a rising of something from nothing. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=54) |  Well, the nothing repolarizes into this kind of energy, and in Zen they want you to ride |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=61) |  on that energy, not just to observe impermanence as an object, but to literally become impermanence. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=69) |  And there is a kind of bouncy, springy vitality to the experience of emptiness as it is encouraged |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=82) |  in the Zen tradition. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=84) |  And that was fostered by a certain rhythm of practice, if you've ever been to Zen retreats, |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=92) |  where you're never allowed to fixate. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=94) |  In Vipassana we move so slow that you disappear. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=99) |  In Zen you move so fast that you disappear. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=102) |  And the idea is that you're, I would almost say, although this may sound a little bit |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=110) |  inscrutable, that in mindfulness practice you first observe impermanence, and then down |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=120) |  the line, hopefully, you'll learn to ride on impermanence and live it, have it animate |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=131) |  you. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=132) |  But in Zen, the style of the monastery, the style of the training, with its spontaneity |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=140) |  and its demand to perform without thinking, what that does is that causes you to ride |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=149) |  on impermanence. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=150) |  And if you live impermanence in that lifestyle, then eventually you'll be able to see impermanence |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=158) |  in your sensory experience. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=159) |  It's almost like they approach the same issue from opposite directions. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=164) |  So Zen has a kind of bouncy vitality to it, and a kind of éclat or creativity that is |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=178) |  characteristic of it. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=180) |  Sometimes the Hinayana form of Buddhism, the Vipassana, it's sort of like prosaic and sort |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=188) |  of like, I don't know, low-key and dull and boring, but it's like a good, it gets the |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=202) |  job done. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=205) |  It's like a carefully crafted essay. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=208) |  But Zen stylistically is like an energetic poem. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=213) |  So it's a whole different style of enlightenment, a whole different expression of enlightenment, |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ15Y6WrDTE&t=218) |  yet it's the same enlightenment. |
