    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=0) |  There are various ways to reach the subconscious. The surface of the subconscious can be reached |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=18) |  through mental talk. A little deeper level cannot be reached by mental talk, but it can |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=29) |  be reached by mental images. The deepest level of the subconscious cannot even be reached by |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=37) |  mental images, but it can be reached by body sensations. The way mindfulness deals with the |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=47) |  subconscious is by setting up a feedback loop, which I've described in other segments, |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=57) |  whereby at the level of body sensation, when the reptilian brain, which is essentially a body brain, |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=69) |  a touch-feel brain, when the reptilian brain notices that when it interferes with the flow |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=81) |  of body sensation, its own product of course, that there is suffering, and when it stops |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=89) |  interfering, that there is the absence of suffering or fulfillment, the reptilian brain notices that, |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=99) |  and it is changed in the classical Skinnerian mode. You train the animal the way you train |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=108) |  an animal, with reward and punishment at the level of body sensation. By putting yourself |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=115) |  in an environment where not much is going on for a period of time, either the micro retreat of a |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=124) |  daily sit or the macro retreat of taking a weekend or a week or ten days or longer and going off and |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=135) |  doing nothing but meditation, within that simplified environment, the deepest mind can |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=142) |  unlearn its habit of fighting with itself. Essentially, what B.F. Skinner and the others |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=152) |  in the Behavioralist School proved was that if you want to train an animal, that animal has to |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=162) |  be given rewards and punishments, and those rewards and punishments have to be immediate |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=175) |  upon the behavior, and they have to be absolutely predictable. If they're random, then you won't |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=184) |  get strong learning, and if there's a gap between the behavior and the reinforcing stimulus, then |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=197) |  also there won't be strong learning. So in the simplified environment of a sit or a retreat, |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=205) |  a situation is set up where the animal within us, the reptilian brain, can consistently and |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=214) |  immediately be aware when it fights with itself, there is suffering, so that's the punishment. When |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=223) |  it stops fighting with itself, there is fulfillment, that's the reward. The simplified environment of |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=231) |  formal practice creates the situation where there is consistent and immediate reinforcing feedback. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=243) |  In the classical Skinnerian mode, I know Skinner is sort of a dirty word in a sense, because the |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=254) |  behavioralist influence at a certain period in the academic world led to ridiculous notions about |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=267) |  the nature of humanity. However, they did have some good points going for them, and it turns out |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=277) |  somewhat ironically, I think, that the most subtle and powerful spiritual path that I'm aware of, |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=289) |  something that the Skinnerians would have been horrified by, which is the Buddhist experience, |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=299) |  turns out that large parts of it are best explained by Skinnerian model. But in this case, |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=313) |  the behavior is not that the lizard is being trained to, or the mouse is being trained to |

    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=331) |  a lizard is trained, but by a human who has intentionally set up that situation for themselves |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=341) |  to train their lizard brain. The lizard brain is being trained into something incredibly subtle. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlpXGXZ_dT0&t=350) |  The new behavior is not interfering with its own activity, which is to say that it's being |

     There are various ways to reach the subconscious. The surface of the subconscious can be reached through mental talk. A little deeper level cannot be reached by mental talk, but it can be reached by mental images. The deepest level of the subconscious cannot even be reached by mental images, but it can be reached by body sensations. The way mindfulness deals with the subconscious is by setting up a feedback loop, which I've described in other segments, whereby at the level of body sensation, when the reptilian brain, which is essentially a body brain, a touch-feel brain, when the reptilian brain notices that when it interferes with the flow of body sensation, its own product of course, that there is suffering, and when it stops interfering, that there is the absence of suffering or fulfillment, the reptilian brain notices that, and it is changed in the classical Skinnerian mode.

Essentially, what B.F.
