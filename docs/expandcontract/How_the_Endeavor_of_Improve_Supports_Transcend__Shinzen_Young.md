    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=14) |  It's like, you know, I don't seem to be getting anywhere with day to day sits, etc., etc. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=21) |  Sometimes if you do some good thing in the world that's special, you volunteer, you do something, |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=39) |  and then you go back to your formal practice, you'll see that it's sort of like, now it's moving again. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=47) |  That would be an example of the seva or what you put out influencing what you experience. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=58) |  It goes to a somewhat broader formulation, which is see beyond self and world, refine self and world, or improve self and world. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=71) |  So you make improvements in yourself and your world that will then influence your experience during formal practice, |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=82) |  which is the main place that you're trying to see beyond the self and the world. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=88) |  So it's a little larger than seva, it's more improve. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=93) |  For example, diet, lifestyle, ethics, sila, traditionally it's said, well sort of get that together before you even try to sit, |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=107) |  because otherwise it's just going to be chaos sitting when you try to sit. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=112) |  So the fact that you have a certain lifestyle, that you're not bringing all this awareness of guilt and bad karma to your sits, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=126) |  you're not conflicted about- you're less conflicted about your life because you're living your life in a better way, |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=138) |  perhaps diet enters in, exercise, all that sort of stuff. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=143) |  So those are improvements in yourself. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=147) |  You bring those- those improvements will probably improve your experience in formal practice. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=155) |  And then there's the knowledge that you're putting on good things into the world, |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=160) |  and that's in your subliminal consciousness, and it's there, whether you're surface aware of it or not, |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=171) |  it's sort of there in your practice and that supports you also. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=176) |  So it's really broader than how seva supports sadhana, |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9f9BjcE3lo&t=183) |  it's more like how the endeavor of improve supports the endeavor of transcend. |

     It's not an uncommon experience that people report, well I'm sort of spinning my wheels with my formal practice. It's like, you know, I don't seem to be getting anywhere with day to day sits, etc., etc. Sometimes if you do some good thing in the world that's special, you volunteer, you do something, and then you go back to your formal practice, you'll see that it's sort of like, now it's moving again. That would be an example of the seva or what you put out influencing what you experience. It goes to a somewhat broader formulation, which is see beyond self and world, refine self and world, or improve self and world. So you make improvements in yourself and your world that will then influence your experience during formal practice, which is the main place that you're trying to see beyond the self and the world. So it's a little larger than seva, it's more improve. For example, diet, lifestyle, ethics, sila, traditionally it's said, well sort of get that together before you even try to sit, because otherwise it's just going to be chaos sitting when you try to sit. So the fact that you have a certain lifestyle, that you're not bringing all this awareness of guilt and bad karma to your sits, you're not conflicted about- you're less conflicted about your life because you're living your life in a better way, perhaps diet enters in, exercise, all that sort of stuff. So those are improvements in yourself. You bring those- those improvements will probably improve your experience in formal practice. And then there's the knowledge that you're putting on good things into the world, and that's in your subliminal consciousness, and it's there, whether you're surface aware of it or not, it's sort of there in your practice and that supports you also. So it's really broader than how seva supports sadhana, it's more like how the endeavor of improve supports the endeavor of transcend.
