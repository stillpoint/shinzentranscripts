    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=0) |  Once again, welcome. |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=8) |  As I always say, it is well that you have come. |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=11) |  You've come a long way to come to this practice. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=18) |  And we'll be talking about this practice. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=21) |  We'll be talking about the concepts that you need for this practice. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=25) |  And we'll be giving you a chance to do the techniques that will develop the core skills |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=32) |  of this practice. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=35) |  You already know the big picture. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=37) |  We do this for ourself, and we do this for others. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=41) |  People go through a certain education process in school. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=45) |  And usually at the end of school, it's like, OK, I've sort of done the education piece. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=52) |  So life is sort of a school for people. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=56) |  And at some point, most people reach a point where they have the perception, well, I've |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=65) |  grown as much as I need to grow. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=68) |  I'm an adult. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=69) |  I'm established. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=70) |  I've got this or that. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=72) |  I don't need a radical new something. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=76) |  I've completed my education. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=79) |  But some people mature to the point where they realize that there's one more level of |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=88) |  learning as a human that is available if you want to. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=93) |  That's what each and every one of you has reached. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=97) |  You've reached that point of maturity where you're ready for sort of the last lesson for |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=105) |  the human. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=106) |  You have to go through a lot of different lessons. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=109) |  But the last lesson is the one that is designed to bring you to total happiness, happiness |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=122) |  that is dependent on conditions, but also to a happiness that is independent of conditions |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=134) |  for yourself and for others. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=136) |  This might be called total happiness. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=139) |  So this is the continuing education that we came here to get. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=147) |  And I want to congratulate each and every one of you for being that old, that adult, |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=156) |  that you've reached the point where you're ready to do what few people are actually ready |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=160) |  to do at this point in human history. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=164) |  Things were different in the past and things will probably be different in the future, |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=169) |  but recently, the last many thousands of years is recently, rather few humans have reached |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=178) |  this point. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=179) |  But you have. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=180) |  And that's extraordinary. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=181) |  It will be my privilege, my joy to facilitate this process for you, and I am totally jazzed, |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=198) |  stoked, ready to go. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=202) |  We're going to have a great week. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=203) |  Thank you. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJuXISe-o7o&t=204) |  LE toppings on my plate. |
