    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=0) |  The old concept of asceticism that was present in Buddha's time, probably originally starting |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=17) |  in shamanic ordeals for powers, and then people noticed, well, if I sort of torture myself, |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=24) |  I sort of get better as a person, and then the Buddha's saying, no, it's not the fact |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=30) |  that you're torturing yourself, it's that in these ceremonies, you're experiencing uncomfortable |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=36) |  sensations with equanimity, that's purifying consciousness, but you could do just as well |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=41) |  with pleasure. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=43) |  And if you look at the classic Buddhist texts with the longer discourses of the Buddha, |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=49) |  he essentially describes going into altered blissful states and having equanimity with |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=57) |  them, and that purifying consciousness through the process of having equanimity with these |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=66) |  absorptions, and then that taking you to something that is beyond bliss, beyond pleasure and |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=72) |  pain, beyond all dualities, which is the absolute rest of nirvana. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=77) |  So there's an actual description of working with, a lot of descriptions actually, of working |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=83) |  with pleasant experiences, but with an emphasis on equanimity, they purify consciousness, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=90) |  they deeply fulfill, and if they purify consciousness profoundly enough, the blocks to nirvana are |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=98) |  worked through. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=99) |  There are what are called the dhutangas, which are, depending on how you want to count them, |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=105) |  12 or 13 uncomfortable practices that the monks were allowed to do but not required |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=113) |  to do, like yasa, for example. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=116) |  A person could take a vow, I'm not going to, I'm going to sit always at night, not lay |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=122) |  down. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=123) |  That is a practice, but not for one night, okay? |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=127) |  A person could say, I'm going to do this for the duration, or, you know, for a week or |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=132) |  something like that. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=133) |  That's one of the dhutangas, that's the term that was for, for allowed uncomfortable practices. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=141) |  But the Buddha didn't allow uncomfortable practices that would be harmful to your body, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=147) |  or that would wipe you out so badly that you, you weren't really doing practice anymore, |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=154) |  you were just sort of, you know, out of it. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=158) |  Beauty is another of the components that constitutes mindful awareness, in the way that I like |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsyekyUsImc&t=167) |  to think about mindful awareness. |
