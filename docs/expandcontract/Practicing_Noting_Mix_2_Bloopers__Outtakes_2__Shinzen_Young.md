    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=0) |  I |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=27) |  will |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=57) |  Ah yes, now the progeny begins to float. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=64) |  I don't normally talk like this, Shunzhen, but when I hear you do something like this, I've got to say, you're a fucking genius. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=89) |  Pardon the French, yes. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=92) |  There are times when darn just isn't enough. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=106) |  It's like when you hit your thumb with a hammer, you know, saying, oh darn. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=114) |  Well, now I've got local global of pleasant self-referential approbation flavors. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=122) |  I thank you for that. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=124) |  And I can get the spread. I'm getting I'm zooming in and out. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=128) |  The primary is here, but it's down there and there too. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=218) |  Okay, now I'm going to get to use a real, real geek word. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=238) |  If a single person in this room knows what this word means, I am going to be immensely surprised. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=248) |  Now you're all listening. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=273) |  Now, mind you, there are approximately a half million words. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=279) |  No, no, quarter, quarter, no, about a half. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=283) |  Yeah, about a half million words. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=298) |  The word does it did pop up into my talk space. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=303) |  Lysencephalic, S-I-L-I-S-E-N-C-E-P-H-A-L-I-C. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=320) |  Our brains got too big for our skulls, so they developed convolutions. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=325) |  So we have these gyri and sulci. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=331) |  But if you look at a rat brain, it's flat. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=336) |  It's smooth. The surface is smooth. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=339) |  So non-convoluted brain type are called lysencephalic. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=356) |  So why is this related to anything? |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=367) |  Well, the problem is the convolutions obscure the organization of the brain, especially in a human brain. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=386) |  So they have what they call exploded brains that a computer can do where it makes it into a giant ball. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=392) |  So then it makes you see how it's really organized. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=395) |  It's more intuitive. |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=396) |  But you don't need that with a rat brain. It's already that way. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=399) |  And if you look at the mapping of the processing areas in a rat's brain, |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=406) |  here's the part that does the body, here's the part that does the auditory, |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=411) |  here's the part that does the visual. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=424) |  I suggested that we do, as a practice in life, focus on positive during this ten minutes that we've been talking. |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=454) |  Since I suggested doing it, to you folks, that means, of course, I have to do it. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=485) |  I got this immediate, incredibly subtle hit of fear and sadness. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=507) |  So if you decide to have a positive social emotion with actual other humans, |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=526) |  don't be surprised if it may resonate with some other emotion. |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=544) |  For no reason whatsoever, other than you suddenly add the temerity to work with feel space in front of a group of people. |
    | [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=567) |  Yeah, yeah. From myself, just, oh my god, I'm going to have to be in po... |
    | [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=574) |  It's not like I don't do it, okay, but it's like, no, I have to do it, and they're going to do it. |
    | [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=579) |  And there was like this fear, which I can understand, but why the tear? |
    | [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWFy4sOwDtE&t=599) |  And I don't need to know, because I spotted it, and I quantified it. |
