    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=0) |  So to describe the unhealthy way? |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=17) |  The unhealthy way is that you don't have precision about what's happening where and you're constantly |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=27) |  fighting with whatever's happening. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=29) |  So you might be saying, I'm going to get rid of this, I've got to get rid of this, I've |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=31) |  got to get rid of this. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=32) |  Well, it's like, no, I don't want this, and you tighten around it mentally and emotionally. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=38) |  So you're fighting with it at many levels of your being, both on the surface and in |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=43) |  the depths, and you're not precise about exactly what's happening where when. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=49) |  That's an unhealthy turning towards the sensory challenge. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=54) |  So you're feeding it in a way by doing that. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=56) |  That's a very good way to put it. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=58) |  It's feeding the fire. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=61) |  Now most people think, well, if I focus on it, I will automatically be feeding the fire. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=66) |  The more I focus on it, the worse it's going to get. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=68) |  However, that is profoundly not true if you've been trained in systematic techniques. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=75) |  The systematic techniques will teach you how to untangle the components of the experience |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=84) |  so they don't multiply into overwhelm. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=87) |  You'll learn how to separate, oh, this part is the physical body, this part is the emotional |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=92) |  body, this part is the visual thought, this part is the auditory, the mental talk. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=101) |  Let's say that a person comes to you and they say, I'm suffering at level, you say, what's |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=109) |  your suffering? |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=110) |  How much are you suffering right now? |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=112) |  And they say, I'm suffering at the maximum possible. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=115) |  What's that number? |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=116) |  They say, well, 10,000. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=120) |  It's 10,000. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=121) |  It's like totally over the top. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=124) |  Maximum possible human suffering. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=128) |  That's because they're turning towards the discomfort in an unskillful way. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=135) |  If they were to turn their attention towards the discomfort with the disciplined skill |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=141) |  that allows you to separate the components, what they would discover is that that number |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=150) |  10,000 is arising due to 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=160) |  Because all those four channels are onto it? |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=163) |  Not because they're all on, but because they're all on and they're crisscrossing and multiplying |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=170) |  with each other. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=171) |  How do you separate the channels and go to one at a time? |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=174) |  How would someone do that in meditation? |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=176) |  You use a technique called mindfulness that will teach you in a disciplined way how to |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=183) |  focus on each one individually. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=186) |  So you tease them out. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=188) |  And then when they happen collectively, instead of 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, 10 times |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=193) |  10 is 100, another 10 times 10 is another 100, 100 times 100 is 10,000. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=199) |  So you kind of pull apart the gestalt then. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=201) |  It's no longer a gestalt. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=203) |  It's just four things. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=207) |  And your perception is now exactly what is there. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=212) |  10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=216) |  They're all on. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=217) |  And one at a time. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=218) |  Well, you first learn how to have them one at a time, but then you can hold them all |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=223) |  at once. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=224) |  But it's still just 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 rather than 10 times 10, because now they're |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=230) |  separate, even when they're happening all at the same time. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=233) |  So do the math. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=234) |  If we say that without changing your sensory experience at all, but by merely changing |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=241) |  your ability to separate it into its natural atoms, if we were to say to a person, I'm |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=249) |  going to take you from suffering at 10,000 to suffering at 40. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=253) |  I'm going to take a 10,000 pound weight off your chest, but you will have to carry 40 |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=259) |  pounds. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=260) |  Sounds like a deal, right? |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=262) |  It's a big reduction. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=263) |  I mean, it goes from hopeless, overwhelmed to, okay, I can handle it. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=272) |  And how would you suggest they deal with that if, say, they're feeling the feeling? |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=278) |  What do you have them do? |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=281) |  They have to be trained in specific exercises. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=285) |  In other words, it's not so much I'm going to now describe to you in two minutes and |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=288) |  you're going to be able to do it. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=291) |  You have to find a teacher or listen to a CD that teaches those techniques, and you |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=297) |  just follow those exercises. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=301) |  So I guess I would say, well, how do you get strong? |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=305) |  The quick answer is go to the gym and do the Nautilus cycle. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=308) |  That's not, you have to actually go and have somebody show you how to do the Nautilus |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=312) |  cycle. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=313) |  So you need a person or an interactive website or a CD to teach you how to do that, but I'm |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=318) |  giving you the theory. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=320) |  So the theory says divide and conquer. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=323) |  So there's a way of focusing on it where you first break it up into its components. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=329) |  Now you've gone from 10,000 to 40, that's pretty good. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=333) |  That means 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=335) |  Now let's look at each one of those 10. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=338) |  Is there really 10 there? |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=341) |  Or is there really one there that's being multiplied by 10 because of resistance? |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=350) |  Oh, that's interesting. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=354) |  And it turns out it's going to be that. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=357) |  So now we train away the resistance. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=361) |  Learning to tease out the strands is the part of mindfulness that is sensory clarity. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=367) |  The training away the resistance is the part of mindfulness that is equanimity. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=372) |  You also need concentration power so you can focus on one strand at a time in order to |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=378) |  be able to learn about each one. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=381) |  So we teach you concentration, clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=384) |  That allows you to separate the strands and then reduce the resistance to each strand. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=390) |  So now we've gone from 10,000 to 4, which essentially says that for all intents and |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=398) |  purposes we have eliminated your suffering, even though the physical pain, the emotional |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=405) |  sensation, and the thoughts and the mental talk are still there. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=414) |  They're still there. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=415) |  They're not in the way. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=416) |  It's a miracle. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=417) |  It's hard to believe that this could happen. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=421) |  We call it the miracle of mindfulness. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=424) |  That's a healthy way to bring your attention to it. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=429) |  And it's very fortunate for us human beings that that strategy exists because you may |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=435) |  attempt to turn away onto something restful, positive, grounding, and you may find you |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=441) |  can't do it. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=442) |  It's just so much in your face. |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=444) |  You just can't do it. |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=446) |  And you've got this other way of working. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=449) |  Just to recap, get the big picture, if you have a health situation and you would like |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=454) |  to use your focus power to deal with that, be clear. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=461) |  Am I using it to change the situation objectively? |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=465) |  Or am I cultivating a skill that broadly reduces suffering and may change it, the object of |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=471) |  situation too? |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=473) |  Or am I doing both? |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=475) |  I would suggest that a person can do one, the other, or both. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=482) |  But I would hope that they not do neither. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=487) |  And there's one other technique. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=488) |  Not do either. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=489) |  There's another technique that I think we haven't mentioned that much, which is focusing |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=493) |  on the positive as a part of what you've just elucidated. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=502) |  That would come under the category of focus away. |
    | [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=504) |  Okay, focus on the positive comes under the category of focus away. |
    | [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=508) |  If by positive you mean positive mental images, mental talk, and so forth. |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=512) |  And it reminds me again of Bill Bengston's recommendations to people with cancer was |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=517) |  to focus on seeing themselves well, doing whatever they're doing because they're well. |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=523) |  So there's no focus at all on the cancer or shrieking the cancer, but it's visualizing |
    | [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=527) |  themselves doing what they would be doing most happily in their lives because they're |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=533) |  doing it completely well. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=534) |  Very good. |
    | [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=535) |  So I think we've pretty much covered the field. |
    | [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=538) |  Thank you so much. |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=539) |  That's very, very helpful. |
    | [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=540) |  My pleasure. |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=542) |  And you have a website that people can link to to help with using these techniques? |
    | [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRz7VapI5w&t=546) |  Learn all this stuff? |

     So to describe the unhealthy way? The unhealthy way is that you don't have precision about what's happening where and you're constantly fighting with whatever's happening. So you might be saying, I'm going to get rid of this, I've got to get rid of this, I've got to get rid of this. Well, it's like, no, I don't want this, and you tighten around it mentally and emotionally. So you're fighting with it at many levels of your being, both on the surface and in the depths, and you're not precise about exactly what's happening where when. That's an unhealthy turning towards the sensory challenge. So you're feeding it in a way by doing that. That's a very good way to put it. It's feeding the fire. Now most people think, well, if I focus on it, I will automatically be feeding the fire. The more I focus on it, the worse it's going to get. However, that is profoundly not true if you've been trained in systematic techniques. The systematic techniques will teach you how to untangle the components of the experience so they don't multiply into overwhelm. You'll learn how to separate, oh, this part is the physical body, this part is the emotional body, this part is the visual thought, this part is the auditory, the mental talk. Let's say that a person comes to you and they say, I'm suffering at level, you say, what's your suffering? How much are you suffering right now? And they say, I'm suffering at the maximum possible. What's that number? They say, well, 10,000. It's 10,000. It's like totally over the top. Maximum possible human suffering. That's because they're turning towards the discomfort in an unskillful way. If they were to turn their attention towards the discomfort with the disciplined skill that allows you to separate the components, what they would discover is that that number 10,000 is arising due to 10 times 10 times 10 times 10. Because all those four channels are onto it? Not because they're all on, but because they're all on and they're crisscrossing and multiplying with each other. How do you separate the channels and go to one at a time? How would someone do that in meditation? You use a technique called mindfulness that will teach you in a disciplined way how to focus on each one individually. So you tease them out. And then when they happen collectively, instead of 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, 10 times 10 is 100, another 10 times 10 is another 100, 100 times 100 is 10,000. So you kind of pull apart the gestalt then. It's no longer a gestalt. It's just four things. And your perception is now exactly what is there. 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10. They're all on. And one at a time. Well, you first learn how to have them one at a time, but then you can hold them all at once. But it's still just 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10 rather than 10 times 10, because now they're separate, even when they're happening all at the same time. So do the math. If we say that without changing your sensory experience at all, but by merely changing your ability to separate it into its natural atoms, if we were to say to a person, I'm going to take you from suffering at 10,000 to suffering at 40. I'm going to take a 10,000 pound weight off your chest, but you will have to carry 40 pounds. Sounds like a deal, right? It's a big reduction. I mean, it goes from hopeless, overwhelmed to, okay, I can handle it. And how would you suggest they deal with that if, say, they're feeling the feeling? What do you have them do? They have to be trained in specific exercises. In other words, it's not so much I'm going to now describe to you in two minutes and you're going to be able to do it. You have to find a teacher or listen to a CD that teaches those techniques, and you just follow those exercises. So I guess I would say, well, how do you get strong? The quick answer is go to the gym and do the Nautilus cycle. That's not, you have to actually go and have somebody show you how to do the Nautilus cycle. So you need a person or an interactive website or a CD to teach you how to do that, but I'm giving you the theory. So the theory says divide and conquer. So there's a way of focusing on it where you first break it up into its components. Now you've gone from 10,000 to 40, that's pretty good. That means 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10. Now let's look at each one of those 10. Is there really 10 there? Or is there really one there that's being multiplied by 10 because of resistance? Oh, that's interesting. And it turns out it's going to be that. So now we train away the resistance. Learning to tease out the strands is the part of mindfulness that is sensory clarity. The training away the resistance is the part of mindfulness that is equanimity. You also need concentration power so you can focus on one strand at a time in order to be able to learn about each one. So we teach you concentration, clarity, and equanimity. That allows you to separate the strands and then reduce the resistance to each strand. So now we've gone from 10,000 to 4, which essentially says that for all intents and purposes we have eliminated your suffering, even though the physical pain, the emotional sensation, and the thoughts and the mental talk are still there. They're still there. They're not in the way. It's a miracle. It's hard to believe that this could happen. We call it the miracle of mindfulness. That's a healthy way to bring your attention to it. And it's very fortunate for us human beings that that strategy exists because you may attempt to turn away onto something restful, positive, grounding, and you may find you can't do it. It's just so much in your face. You just can't do it. And you've got this other way of working. Just to recap, get the big picture, if you have a health situation and you would like to use your focus power to deal with that, be clear. Am I using it to change the situation objectively? Or am I cultivating a skill that broadly reduces suffering and may change it, the object of situation too? Or am I doing both? I would suggest that a person can do one, the other, or both. But I would hope that they not do neither. And there's one other technique. Not do either. There's another technique that I think we haven't mentioned that much, which is focusing on the positive as a part of what you've just elucidated. That would come under the category of focus away. Okay, focus on the positive comes under the category of focus away. If by positive you mean positive mental images, mental talk, and so forth. And it reminds me again of Bill Bengston's recommendations to people with cancer was to focus on seeing themselves well, doing whatever they're doing because they're well. So there's no focus at all on the cancer or shrieking the cancer, but it's visualizing themselves doing what they would be doing most happily in their lives because they're doing it completely well. Very good. So I think we've pretty much covered the field. Thank you so much. That's very, very helpful. My pleasure. And you have a website that people can link to to help with using these techniques? Learn all this stuff? Yes. Yes, they can go to basicmindfulness.org. It's all there. Thank you so much for your questions.
