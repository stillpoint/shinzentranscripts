    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=0) |  Taming the ox. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=19) |  You internalize the enlightenment to the point where it can't slip away from you and |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=29) |  doesn't run wild. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=33) |  It follows you. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=38) |  And as wonderful as that is, that cannot be compared to getting on the ox, actually riding |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=51) |  it. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=52) |  This is awesome. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=55) |  People are really afraid of this. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=57) |  It's one thing to see the ox, even to catch it, even to sort of get it to be manageable. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=67) |  This is the ox of consciousness. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=71) |  The samgau. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=78) |  When it comes to riding on the ox, that's scary. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=83) |  Some of you are facing this stage. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=88) |  If you look carefully, you'll see the ox is going this way. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=98) |  See the boy? |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=100) |  He's playing a flute, quite relaxed, but he's looking the other way. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=108) |  He's riding the ox backwards. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=112) |  You understand? |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=116) |  There's no informed consent to enlightenment. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=121) |  Enlightenment is better than you think it is and not nearly what it's cracked up to |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=126) |  be. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=128) |  Which one of those did you want to hear? |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=131) |  Both or neither? |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=136) |  Enlightenment is like continually falling off a cliff and being completely comfortable |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=142) |  with that. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=145) |  A great and powerful beast carries you. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=153) |  You have to give up your investment with where it's going. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=161) |  It's the ultimate act of surrender, riding the ox backwards. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=166) |  The flow of impermanence. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=171) |  It's like falling down, but you don't fall down. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=176) |  You fall up into existence moment by moment, which is what pratityasamutpada means. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=183) |  It's a falling, but a falling up without any fixation, without needing to know what's going |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=193) |  to happen next. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=194) |  You simply fall into what needs to be done moment by moment. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=203) |  This might be called the act of true faith, as opposed to belief, which is holding onto |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=212) |  something. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=213) |  Faith is letting go of the need to be oriented, the need to have answers. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=225) |  This is surrendering to the flow of expansion and contraction, riding, riding on the wave |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=234) |  of the dynamic wave of nothing whatsoeverness, and letting it carry you. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=246) |  So that's quite a profound act of faith. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=252) |  What comes next? |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=263) |  The ox has now carried you home. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=269) |  He's home. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=274) |  And he's completely at rest. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=280) |  He's found final repose of the spirit in his home. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=288) |  And the ox is gone. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=292) |  Only who he really was remains. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=298) |  Just the person. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=301) |  That true, authentic human with no fixated position whatsoever. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=311) |  And no more need for a mind as an object. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=319) |  He's home. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=321) |  He rode the ox home. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=324) |  Complete enlightenment. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=327) |  Nirvana. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=330) |  But there's three more pictures. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=334) |  What could they possibly stand for? |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=338) |  Well if you read the books, they give you various explanations. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=346) |  But I was privileged to discuss these pictures with a Japanese Zen master many years ago, |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=360) |  who told me that there's an oral tradition about these ten pictures that has not been |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=368) |  written down. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=370) |  That really it ends here. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=373) |  This is complete enlightenment, this is final repose. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=377) |  Pictures eight, nine, and ten represent the substance, form, and purpose of enlightenment. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=392) |  Substance in Chinese is called Ti, which literally means body. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=401) |  The form is called Xiang, which means just that, the form or the appearance. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=409) |  And then what it's good for, what it's used for is Yong, and that's the application or |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=414) |  the use. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=416) |  So Ti, Xiang, Yong. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=419) |  According to this Roshi's oral tradition, the last three of these ox herding pictures |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=429) |  tell us the substance, the appearance, and the ultimate use of enlightenment. |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=440) |  So you can hardly wait, right? |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=443) |  Substance is coming up first. |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=445) |  What it's made out of, the matter. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=449) |  The matter itself. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=457) |  And here is the substance of enlightenment. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=461) |  No substance whatsoever. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=465) |  Right? |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=468) |  When the emperor asked Bodhidharma, what is the first principle of holiness? |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=478) |  What did Bodhidharma say? |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=480) |  Wide open and nothing holy. |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=486) |  That's the form of enlightenment. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=493) |  The mountains and the cherry blossoms, the ordinary appearances of the world, every single |
    | [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PQonSiGkVE&t=499) |  thing is the appearance of enlightenment. |
