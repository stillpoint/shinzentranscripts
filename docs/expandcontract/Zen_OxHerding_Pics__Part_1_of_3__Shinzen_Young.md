    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=0) |  The Chan or Zen school sometimes calls itself |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=27) |  the school of consciousness. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=36) |  In other words, it teaches the nature of consciousness. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=45) |  There is a famous set of drawings that show one paradigm or one possible model for the |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=60) |  path of coming to understand the nature of your consciousness. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=70) |  And it's called the Ten Ox Herding Pictures, 十牛图 in Mandarin pronunciation, 十牛图 |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=78) |  in Sino-Japanese. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=81) |  牛 means an ox, and the ox symbolizes the nature of consciousness. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=93) |  So they call it the 心牛, the ox of consciousness. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=98) |  The consciousness symbolized by the ox. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=105) |  But to understand consciousness, in other words experience, our senses, is also enlightenment. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=116) |  So the Ten Ox Herding Pictures can be interpreted in two different ways. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=121) |  One is they show you stages on the path to enlightenment. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=127) |  The other is they show you the process of understanding or truly grasping what consciousness |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=137) |  is. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=138) |  But of course those are exactly the same thing. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=142) |  I would like to go through them. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=149) |  I don't know if you can all see this, but this is the first picture. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=155) |  And this is called Searching for the Ox. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=161) |  Notice that there is no ox to be found. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=166) |  The Chinese verse that goes with this says, the ox herding boy is completely lost. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=176) |  There's no trace of the ox. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=179) |  There's only the cicadas chirping. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=184) |  Do you understand who the ox herding boy is and what the cicadas chirping? |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=192) |  This is the situation of most people on this planet at this time, unfortunately. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=200) |  They know they want something, but what they think they want is not what they really want. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=209) |  Everyone's searching. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=211) |  Like that song goes, everybody's looking for something. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=216) |  But what people think they want is happiness dependent on conditions. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=225) |  But what they really want is happiness independent of conditions, symbolized by the enlightenment |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=234) |  ox or the consciousness, the nature of consciousness ox. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=241) |  But there's no ox at all, not even any trace of the ox. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=245) |  He's just wandering around, searching for something, looking for something, and just |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=252) |  hearing the twittering of the cicadas, which is unfortunately the situation for most people. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=265) |  Some people though, in their wanderings, get fortunate. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=275) |  They see the tracks of something. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=281) |  They haven't seen the nature of consciousness. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=285) |  They haven't seen the ox. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=288) |  They haven't experienced enlightenment. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=291) |  But something gives them an indication that there is this possibility. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=300) |  Maybe they heard a dharma talk. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=303) |  Maybe they had some experience when they were little that they never forgot, or when they |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=310) |  were grown up. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=312) |  Maybe they had a friend that came to a retreat, etc., etc. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=318) |  They get some indication that there's another possibility beyond the transient fulfillment |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=332) |  of the twittering world. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=335) |  So this is called seeing the footprints. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=341) |  Every one of you has seen the footprints, or you wouldn't be here. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=347) |  You might guess what the next step is. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=352) |  He sees the tail on the ox, the tush, and a few hairs of the tail. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=360) |  Hasn't really seen the whole ox yet. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=365) |  But can you see? |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=367) |  There's the tush and the tail. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=369) |  And it's like, oh my god, it really exists. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=374) |  I haven't seen it all, but I have seen a little piece of it. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=379) |  Most of you are at least in this category. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=383) |  You've gone beyond just seeing the footprints. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=386) |  You've actually gotten a little visage of who you really are. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=393) |  Or you wouldn't have survived two weeks in silence. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=399) |  So you've seen the ox, but that's not the same at all as catching the ox. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=416) |  You see, he's got the whole ox, and he's got a hold of it. |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=425) |  Now we could say that this would be perhaps one's first glimpse of no-self, stream entry, |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=440) |  or Kensho-type experience. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=448) |  You've actually seen the whole ox, the nature of consciousness, which is no-thingness. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=461) |  And you've got a handle on it, but it's still running wild. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=468) |  At least you've captured the ox. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=473) |  And it's in your ken. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=476) |  You can see it any time you want. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8aN9O73lgg&t=479) |  But that's a far cry from... |

     The Chan or Zen school sometimes calls itself the school of consciousness. In other words, it teaches the nature of consciousness. There is a famous set of drawings that show one paradigm or one possible model for the path of coming to understand the nature of your consciousness. And it's called the Ten Ox Herding Pictures, 十牛图 in Mandarin pronunciation, 十牛图 in Sino-Japanese. 牛 means an ox, and the ox symbolizes the nature of consciousness. So they call it the 心牛, the ox of consciousness. The consciousness symbolized by the ox. But to understand consciousness, in other words experience, our senses, is also enlightenment. So the Ten Ox Herding Pictures can be interpreted in two different ways. One is they show you stages on the path to enlightenment.

But what people think they want is happiness dependent on conditions. But what they really want is happiness independent of conditions, symbolized by the enlightenment ox or the consciousness, the nature of consciousness ox. But there's no ox at all, not even any trace of the ox. He's just wandering around, searching for something, looking for something, and just hearing the twittering of the cicadas, which is unfortunately the situation for most people. Some people though, in their wanderings, get fortunate. They see the tracks of something. They haven't seen the nature of consciousness. They haven't seen the ox.
