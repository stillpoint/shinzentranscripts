    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=29) | The light came through the window |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=37) | Straight from the sun above |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=44) | So inside my little room |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=52) | There plunged a rays of love |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=60) | And streams of light clearly saw |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=68) | The dust you seldom see |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=75) | Out of which the nameless makes |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=82) | A name for one like me |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=89) | I'll try to say a little more |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=97) | Love went on and on |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=106) | Until it reached an open door |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=112) | And love itself |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=117) | Love itself was gone |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=130) | All busy in the sunlight |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=138) | The flecks did float and dance |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=145) | And I was tumbled up with them |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=153) | Inform their circumstance |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=158) | I'll try to say a little more |

    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=186) | Love itself was gone |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=197) | Then I came back from where I'd been |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=206) | My room had looked the same |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=214) | But there was nothing left between |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=223) | The nameless and the name |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=230) | All busy in the sunlight |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=238) | The flecks did float and dance |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=246) | And I was tumbled up with them |

    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=259) | I'll try to say a little more |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3MgjpMbADA&t=267) | Love went on and on |
