    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=0) |  How does self-inquiry relate to mindfulness practice? |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=5) |  Someone wrote in asking, how does self-inquiry relate to mindfulness practice? |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=12) |  It's a really interesting question. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=16) |  In a sense, it would seem like they're very, very different. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=21) |  If you're not familiar with what's meant by self-inquiry, actually there's a range of |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=27) |  traditions that teach it, including Zen, some Zen teachers, but also many people working |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=34) |  within the Hindu tradition, the non-dual tradition, and so forth. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=39) |  Basic idea is you're constantly asking a question like, who am I or what am I? |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=46) |  Whatever comes up, you're saying, well, who's experiencing this? |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=50) |  What's experiencing this? |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=51) |  You're having a thought, well, where did the thought come from? |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=55) |  Who's thinking this thought? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=57) |  It's an approach that's been discovered independently in a number of cultures, used all around the |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=64) |  world, actually. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=65) |  As I mentioned, there's some Zen teachers that teach it. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=70) |  There's also within the Hindu fold, and then people not affiliated with either Hinduism |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=76) |  or Buddhism would give you a similar kind of model. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=81) |  As I say, they all have the same basic idea, it's like turn consciousness back on itself, |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=88) |  turn the awareness back on itself. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=91) |  That would seem to be a very different practice from mindfulness. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=96) |  Mindfulness asks you to keep track of what's going on. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=100) |  However, if you really look deeply into what mindfulness practice is about, you will see |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=109) |  that there's an interesting symmetry between self-inquiry on one hand and mindfulness on |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=118) |  the other hand. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=123) |  It is true that the initial experiences that a person has when they do mindfulness can |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=129) |  be described as, I'm a meditator over here observing stuff over there. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=137) |  However, with time, two very significant things take place. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=145) |  One is that the habit of meditating begins to meditate. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=152) |  In other words, there's not so much that sense of, there has to be an I here doing the meditation. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=160) |  There's a momentum of concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity, those three things. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=167) |  A momentum of that builds up and it just carries itself. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=171) |  One important change that takes place with time, with mindfulness practice, is that sense |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=178) |  of efforting and thinking that you initially needed in order to observe things, that goes |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=186) |  away and there is just the observing. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=190) |  Just the clarity, well, if you want to call it observing, there's just the concentration, |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=195) |  clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=196) |  That's one change. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=198) |  A second change is that you develop a sensitivity to what's called impermanence. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=206) |  Now sometimes impermanence can be sort of continuous or vibratory or wavy, but another |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=213) |  aspect of impermanence is noting the moment when things vanish. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=219) |  If you read the classic Visuddhimagga, for example, the path of purification written |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=224) |  in probably the 5th century in Sri Lanka by Buddhakosa, he talks about a stage where your |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=231) |  awareness is dominated by rising and passing, and then a stage where your awareness is dominated |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=237) |  by just passing. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=239) |  You're just aware of endings, endings, endings. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=243) |  In my vocabulary, I have people note it as ko. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=248) |  It's nothing mystical shmistical. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=250) |  You've all experienced it. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=251) |  You pay attention to your internal conversation as soon as you notice the talk arises, it |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=255) |  sort of vanishes. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=257) |  Mental images disappear. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=258) |  Sounds come to an end. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=259) |  It's no big deal. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=261) |  Something everybody experiences, but you can reach a point in your practice where that |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=266) |  you become really, really aware of how many vanishings there are in things that you thought |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=273) |  were quite solid. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=275) |  So at some point, you're just noting gone, gone, gone, gone. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=279) |  The place, each time you're noting a vanishing, for just a moment, your attention is adverted, |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=286) |  that is to say, turned towards the source of consciousness. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=292) |  Because where something goes to when it vanishes is where it comes from when it arises. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=301) |  So if you want to turn the attention towards the source, you can take one of two strategies. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=311) |  You can say, A has arisen. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=315) |  Now let's look back and see where A came from. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=319) |  That's one way to go about it. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=321) |  That would be the self-inquiry way. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=324) |  And it's very powerful. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=326) |  It works very well for some people. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=329) |  But it doesn't necessarily work well for everyone. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=333) |  Another way to go about it is, well, instead of saying, A is arising, where did A come |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=341) |  from, constantly asking that. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=343) |  Another way to go about it is, A has arisen. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=348) |  Now A disappears. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=350) |  Watch A disappear. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=353) |  And that spot is going to be where B arises from. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=357) |  So you watch the vanishing piece. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=360) |  And if you want to be present at the very instant of the arising of B, you can do that |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=368) |  by noticing the vanishing of A, the thing that preceded it. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=372) |  That's the gone of A is the origin of B. A and B meaning any two successive sensory |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=380) |  experiences, big or small. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=382) |  That's what I meant when I said that there's a kind of symmetry between the two ways of |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=388) |  working. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=389) |  So within the mindfulness tradition, there is actually something that more or less corresponds |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=395) |  to self-inquiry. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=397) |  And it's hugely, hugely important. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=400) |  But it's not done with the model of keep looking back, keep looking back at where things are |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=406) |  coming from. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=407) |  It's done with the model of keep watching where they go to when they pass away. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHUajtPXPDw&t=412) |  Same place though. |

     How does self-inquiry relate to mindfulness practice? Someone wrote in asking, how does self-inquiry relate to mindfulness practice? It's a really interesting question. In a sense, it would seem like they're very, very different. If you're not familiar with what's meant by self-inquiry, actually there's a range of traditions that teach it, including Zen, some Zen teachers, but also many people working within the Hindu tradition, the non-dual tradition, and so forth. Basic idea is you're constantly asking a question like, who am I or what am I? Whatever comes up, you're saying, well, who's experiencing this? What's experiencing this? You're having a thought, well, where did the thought come from? Who's thinking this thought? It's an approach that's been discovered independently in a number of cultures, used all around the world, actually. As I mentioned, there's some Zen teachers that teach it. There's also within the Hindu fold, and then people not affiliated with either Hinduism or Buddhism would give you a similar kind of model. As I say, they all have the same basic idea, it's like turn consciousness back on itself, turn the awareness back on itself. That would seem to be a very different practice from mindfulness.
