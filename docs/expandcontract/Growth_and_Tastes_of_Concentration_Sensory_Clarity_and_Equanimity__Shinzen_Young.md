    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=0) |  Each of those three components grows on average over time. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=20) |  At a specific time, you could have a certain critical mass of concentration, clarity, and |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=39) |  equanimity with regards to a specific experience. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=44) |  And then that experience would become paradoxical. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=47) |  It would be so fully present that it was absent. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=52) |  But it might be a fairly small experience, and that might happen only sporadically. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=60) |  On some days, on some occasions, certain experiences, you get the sense of, as it arose, it completed. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=69) |  So it never constellated into a thing. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=73) |  And when you look back and ask yourself, why did that happen, well, there was an extraordinary |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=78) |  degree of concentration, clarity, and equanimity for those few seconds or for those few minutes |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=85) |  with regards to this phenomenon. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=87) |  Typically, that occurs initially with regards to pain in the sit that, quote, breaks up. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=96) |  It's sort of still there, but it's not really there. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=100) |  That kind of thing is what I meant by critical mass. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=110) |  Looked in the large picture, though, over months, years, decades of practice, there |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=118) |  is a sort of hockey stick growth curve for all three of these elements. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=126) |  However, that growth curve has local fluctuations of peaks and valleys. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=132) |  Some days, your mindfulness factors are more evident. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=139) |  Other days, they're less in the small picture, but then there's the large picture. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=144) |  With regards to how you taste each of these, that's a very good question. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=155) |  Concentration has its own taste. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=157) |  It's impossible to describe in words, but once you experience it, you know what it tastes |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=164) |  like. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=165) |  It's the in-the-zone taste. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=167) |  But how do you describe that taste to someone? |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=171) |  It's been fairly credibly scientifically documented that the taste of concentration in and of |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=180) |  itself is sensorially fulfilling. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=184) |  This comes out of the positive psychology work that was done in Chicago by Mike Chixet |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=192) |  Mihaly and others. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=195) |  It has its taste, and you can taste it. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=203) |  Equanimity has its taste, but it's impossible to really describe in words. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=209) |  You develop a taste for it. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=212) |  If I had to put it into words, but this doesn't really do it, but it's a knowing that because |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=220) |  of the open way that you're experiencing this moment, every moment of your future will be |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=226) |  more fulfilling, involve less suffering, and you're also releasing stuff from the past. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=232) |  Some part of you knows that as it equanimizes some present sensory phenomenon. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=239) |  That's the taste of equanimity. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=245) |  So what's the taste of sensory? |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=249) |  Clarity. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=253) |  One is untangling. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=258) |  You say work with feel-image-talk, individually, collectively, and there comes a time when |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=265) |  you get a big fit storm. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=269) |  A big storm of it arises, and because you have so much momentum of clarity, those elements |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=276) |  don't get mixed. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=279) |  All three are happening simultaneously, but they're intrinsically untangled in the arising, |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=287) |  and that's one of the tastes of clarity. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=291) |  It's an unmixing flavor. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=294) |  I don't know how else to describe it. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=296) |  It's a de-conflating, which then removes the flooding effect that people get when many |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=307) |  sensory phenomena are activated simultaneously. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=310) |  They're all still activated at once, but somehow they're not tangling with each other. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=319) |  When that reaches a critical mass, self as thing goes away. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=324) |  It just evaporates. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=327) |  So if you have not a flat screen, but a conventional TV monitor that's a CRT tube, so you look |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=338) |  at it, and let's say that it's showing a white pattern, and I make the claim there's no white |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=344) |  on the screen. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=345) |  That's an illusion. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=347) |  You say, are you crazy? |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=349) |  Just look, there's white. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=351) |  Anybody can see. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=352) |  I say, oh yeah, there's a magnifying glass. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=354) |  We agree this does nothing but resolve. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=356) |  It makes clearer things that are falling together and tangled. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=362) |  It untangles visual experience. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=366) |  So at some point, the perception white goes away, and the perception red, green, blue |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=372) |  arises. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=375) |  Was there ever any white there? |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=377) |  That's sensory clarity. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=379) |  It's resolution power. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=380) |  It's high res. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=382) |  Higher and higher def. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=388) |  The other direction that the sensory clarity goes is the ability to pick up fainter and |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=393) |  fainter signals, which is a power thing. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=399) |  If you have signals that are very low power, very subtle, there's a dimension of clarity |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=409) |  regarding the ability to detect those. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=412) |  My favorite shibboleth, subtle is significant. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=417) |  So the flavors of sensation that drive day-to-day perceptions and behaviors of human beings, |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=429) |  most of them are initially below the threshold of awareness. |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=433) |  With practice, they percolate up to specificity. |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=438) |  So you're able to detect finer and finer arisings, meaning that you're less and less likely to |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=444) |  be hijacked by subliminal images, talk, and especially by subliminal feel. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=451) |  In other words, subliminal phenomena, very faint arisings, have a huge impact on the |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=461) |  subconscious without the conscious knowing. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=464) |  This is one of the main differences between the way that the subconscious is considered |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=473) |  in Western psychology and the way it's considered in Eastern psychology. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=479) |  In Eastern psychology, there's a lot to it, but one of the dimensions that differs is |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=485) |  you're interested in making the real-time subconscious events that are sensory subconscious |
    | [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=495) |  events, specific emotional flavors, mental images, talk that's very faint and very subtle |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=505) |  that's arising in the background. |
    | [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=508) |  That becomes perceptible through developing sensory clarity, so you're not hijacked by |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=516) |  it during the day. |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=522) |  There's a third dimension, which is speed of detection. |
    | [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=529) |  Sight, sight, feel, all-round, all-round, sight, feel. |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=547) |  You notice that I could start on a dime, sight, feel, feel. |
    | [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=556) |  There's no like, okay, I need five minutes to be with my breath and then I can figure |
    | [00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=562) |  out what's going on. |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=564) |  No, no, emphatically no. |
    | [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=568) |  Feel. |
    | [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=569) |  Okay, feel. |
    | [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=572) |  You've got to be able to do it instantly, right in the thrust of any activity, start |
    | [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=580) |  on a dime. |
    | [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=583) |  It's the ability to also immediately detect. |
    | [00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=587) |  Not have to like, okay, the typical, well, I'll sit for 10 minutes and then I can figure |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=593) |  out what the hell's going on inside of me. |
    | [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=596) |  No. |
    | [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=597) |  Okay, it's got to be all rest, touch, any time, any place, one half of a, quarter of |
    | [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=610) |  a second, you're off and running. |
    | [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=613) |  Why? |
    | [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=614) |  Because in a half a second, the terrorists are in the cockpit. |
    | [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=621) |  So maybe the speed of detection is another clarity. |
    | [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=627) |  I'm thinking as I'm sort of obviously making it up as I'm going. |
    | [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=632) |  So the resolution piece, the ability to detect subtle things and the ability to immediately |
    | [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=644) |  be mindful without having to sort of get grounded or whatever people do. |
    | [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0pXThS_nc&t=650) |  Maybe those are the three dimensions of growth and the clarity. |

=== "Text"
     Each of those three components grows on average over time. At a specific time, you could have a certain critical mass of concentration, clarity, and equanimity with regards to a specific experience. And then that experience would become paradoxical. It would be so fully present that it was absent. But it might be a fairly small experience, and that might happen only sporadically. On some days, on some occasions, certain experiences, you get the sense of, as it arose, it completed. So it never constellated into a thing. And when you look back and ask yourself, why did that happen, well, there was an extraordinary degree of concentration, clarity, and equanimity for those few seconds or for those few minutes with regards to this phenomenon. Typically, that occurs initially with regards to pain in the sit that, quote, breaks up. It's sort of still there, but it's not really there. That kind of thing is what I meant by critical mass. Looked in the large picture, though, over months, years, decades of practice, there is a sort of hockey stick growth curve for all three of these elements. However, that growth curve has local fluctuations of peaks and valleys. Some days, your mindfulness factors are more evident. Other days, they're less in the small picture, but then there's the large picture. With regards to how you taste each of these, that's a very good question. Concentration has its own taste.

Some part of you knows that as it equanimizes some present sensory phenomenon. That's the taste of equanimity. So what's the taste of sensory? Clarity. One is untangling. You say work with feel-image-talk, individually, collectively, and there comes a time when you get a big fit storm. A big storm of it arises, and because you have so much momentum of clarity, those elements don't get mixed. All three are happening simultaneously, but they're intrinsically untangled in the arising, and that's one of the tastes of clarity. It's an unmixing flavor. I don't know how else to describe it. It's a de-conflating, which then removes the flooding effect that people get when many sensory phenomena are activated simultaneously. They're all still activated at once, but somehow they're not tangling with each other. When that reaches a critical mass, self as thing goes away. It just evaporates. So if you have not a flat screen, but a conventional TV monitor that's a CRT tube, so you look at it, and let's say that it's showing a white pattern, and I make the claim there's no white on the screen.
