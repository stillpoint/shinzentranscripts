    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=30) |  How's that coming, Lorraine? |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=37) |  It really slowed, so it was almost stopped, but then I noticed it was moving again. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=44) |  When it stopped, was there a deep tranquility within you? Or it just stopped? |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=51) |  Was there a sort of afterglow, or not? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=57) |  No, it was more like the pulsing, although the pulsing is still a flow, but it was not the gentle flow. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=64) |  It kind of took over for a bit, and then I was looking for that gentle flow, and then it sort of showed up again. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=73) |  Excellent. Very clear report. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=76) |  And you're continuing to be able to experience the flow as a pleasant, kind of soothing thing? |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=85) |  Yes. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=87) |  So, you're essentially experiencing widespread poison ivy as a soothing flow of energy. Is that true? |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=98) |  I have to say, yes it is. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=101) |  And yet we did nothing other than focus on just what is. So, that's pretty weird, huh? |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=111) |  Okay. I'm assuming it's mostly in your arms that you've been focusing, is that correct? |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=117) |  Or have you been focusing wherever the poison ivy itches are? |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=121) |  I was focusing on the flow, and I have to say that it sort of went into my abdomen as well. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=129) |  It sort of involved my torso and my arms. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=132) |  It tends to spread, in other words. That is a characteristic of the flow experience. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=138) |  I'd like you to see how widespread within your body you can find phenomena that could come under the category of flow. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=148) |  It could be tingling or waving in your legs, your arms, your torso, your face, expansion, contraction, inward pressures, outward pressures. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=160) |  See how widespread through your body you can find things that might come under that category. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=170) |  Just sort of take an inventory through the body. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=177) |  Now that I've sort of opened up my search, it is all over. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=182) |  It's fairly global in the body? |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=184) |  Yes. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=185) |  I'd like you to zoom out and cover your whole body with awareness and focus in on the flow as encompassing your whole body. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=196) |  That's excellent. Sometimes this is the way it happens. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=211) |  It's fun, isn't it? |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=214) |  Who ever knew that severe poison ivy could be so much fun? Who would have ever thunk it? |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=224) |  You're particularly sensitive to poison ivy, is that correct? |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=228) |  It seems I cannot deny that I am very sensitive to it. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=232) |  You're doing great work. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=237) |  Are you able to get that sense that your whole body is sort of flowing? |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=240) |  Yes. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=241) |  Now we're going to up the challenge level considerably. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=246) |  I'd like you to keep your awareness in the body and if possible on the flow. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=253) |  But I'd like you to open your eyes, but sort of defocus your eyes. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=257) |  Try to just sort of soft focus so you're not too drawn into external sights. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=264) |  And see if it's possible to maintain some contact with that flow with your eyes open. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=273) |  The opening of the eyes could intensify the flow, it could cause the flow to become less, or it might have no effect at all. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=284) |  But does this instruction make sense? Good. I'd like you to try that. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=299) |  Able to maintain some sense of that with your eyes open? |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=303) |  Some sense of it. The pulse kind of asserted itself again. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=308) |  But there's still a bit of a presence of the flow as well. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=312) |  Even with your eyes open? |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=314) |  Yes. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=315) |  That's fantastic. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=318) |  So this shows you that you can maintain this in life. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=322) |  It doesn't have to be just when your eyes are closed necessarily. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=326) |  You could maintain it as you're going about daily life. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=329) |  You might be able to maintain some sense of an awareness of that flow throughout the day. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=334) |  Does that make sense? At least as a theoretical possibility. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=339) |  I'd like you to close your eyes again. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=343) |  And I'd like you to bring your attention to your mind for a moment. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=351) |  We're going to go out of the body. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=353) |  Bring your attention to the area in front of, behind your closed eyes, sort of your mental screen. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=360) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=364) |  If we were to ignore mental images and colors that might be there, we'd be left with dark, bright, or gray. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=373) |  Is it mostly dark for you, mostly bright, or mostly gray? |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=378) |  Mostly dark. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=380) |  I'd like you to focus on how the pattern of dark and bright is changing there. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=385) |  Constantly changing. Does that make sense? |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=388) |  It is moving, right? The dark brightness? Is that correct? |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=396) |  By moving I mean like shifting perhaps in very small ways, or that's not the case? |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=403) |  It's moving in the sense that some of those bright spots are fading and then coming back. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=409) |  That's what I mean. We'll consider that to be flow inside that blank. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=415) |  I'd like you to note that as flow. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=418) |  And if there is any vibration inside the blank, the dark, for example, if there's any light, bubbly or whatever, note that as flow also. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=427) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=429) |  Actually, no. Could you say that again? |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=431) |  Well, when you look at the darkness, brightness, behind your closed eyes, it could be perfectly stable or it could be moving in some way. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=441) |  Would you say it's perfectly stable or there's movement of some sort there? |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=447) |  There's movement of some sort. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=449) |  We'll call that movement flow. Does that make sense? |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=452) |  And I'd like you to just focus on how the visual phenomena there flow. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=460) |  And if you happen to have any mental pictures of things, if they move or change or melt or morph, we'll consider that flow also. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=468) |  So we're going to look at flow inside either your mental blank screen or any mental pictures that might be present. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=476) |  Now, of course, there might be times when there is no flow. Everything might be perfectly stable. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=482) |  So only note flow if something changes. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb8yiNwFBtA&t=485) |  If it doesn't change, then just stay there and let things be stable. |
