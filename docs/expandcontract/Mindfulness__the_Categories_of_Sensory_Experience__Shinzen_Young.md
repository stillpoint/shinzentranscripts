    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=0) |  This is how I like to classify basic sensory experience. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=13) |  When I have people learn mindfulness techniques, I have them note their experience based on |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=21) |  these categories. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=23) |  This system was designed with two goals in mind. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=28) |  One is that it would tend to lead to insights in meditators because they can see how these |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=38) |  different sensory systems interrelate. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=43) |  So that's sort of a pragmatic point of view that it's convenient for people having aha |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=50) |  experiences when they track their sensory events. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=56) |  The other goal was to create a system based on contrasts that would be convenient for |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=63) |  study with what's called fMRI, that's functional magnetic resonance imaging. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=70) |  When you study the neural correlates of experience with fMRI, you can't actually image an experience. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=81) |  All that you can do is image two contrasting states. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=86) |  So I gave a lot of consideration as to what would be the most useful contrasts, both in |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=93) |  terms of image studying that scientists might want to do and in terms of what's likely to |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=102) |  bring about insight experiences for the meditators who are being studied by those scientists. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=109) |  So with those two goals in mind, I created this system. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=114) |  I call it the basic states. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=117) |  The right-left gives you a contrast between a more objective side of experience versus |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=126) |  a more subjective side of experience. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=129) |  For example, there are external physical sounds in the world, but there's also the internal |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=134) |  sound of your self-talk. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=138) |  Sometimes when external sound expands, internal talk might go away. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=144) |  And by watching that contrast, you can see some interesting interactions. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=150) |  So this would be in an auditory domain. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=153) |  I'll get to these guys in a minute. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=156) |  Analogously, there are external sites in the world, but there's also the internal visual |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=160) |  experience of your mental images. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=164) |  When you're thinking of people, places, physical objects, when you have memory, plan, fantasy, |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=170) |  or your eyes are closed and you think about where you are or how your body appears, you're |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=177) |  having visual thoughts. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=180) |  So image is the more subjective side, and the external sites are the more objective |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=186) |  side of visual experience. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=190) |  Then there's somatic experience, in other words, body experience. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=195) |  I believe that it's very important that people develop the ability to detect when their body |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=207) |  has emotional-type sensations. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=210) |  When a person experiences anger, fear, sadness, embarrassment, impatience, disgust, interest, |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=217) |  joy, love, gratitude, humor, smile, and so forth, there are usually body sensations, |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=224) |  distinctive body sensations associated with that. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=227) |  So the real juice of emotional experience, I would claim, is not so much in the internal |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=235) |  talk and mental image, although that of course is important, but it's the emotional-type |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=242) |  sensations that give the strong valence or coloration or power to emotional experiences. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=252) |  So I think it's good that we have a word in English that means body sensation that seems |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=259) |  emotional to a given individual at a given time. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=263) |  There is no such word that has that meaning in English, neither is there any such word |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=269) |  in any language that I'm familiar with. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=272) |  So I arbitrarily assigned the word feel to mean affective somesthesia. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=279) |  That would be a very fancy way of saying emotional body sensations. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=285) |  Affective is a Latin phrase meaning emotional. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=288) |  Somesthesia is body sensation, body experience. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=292) |  So I use feel for that. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=294) |  That would represent a somewhat subjective side of the body relative to touch, which |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=302) |  is everything else, all the other ordinary experiences in the body, itches and aches, |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=307) |  pressures and pains, sleepy sensations, ordinary breathing, ordinary pulse, that kind of thing, |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=314) |  is more of an it. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=316) |  If you have pain, take that as a touch. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=320) |  If the pain causes anger, fear, sadness, those reactions, those body sensations I would call |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=328) |  feel. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=329) |  And in point of fact, feel, image, talk represent a reactive system. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=336) |  They can react to touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=340) |  They're also a proactive system. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=342) |  They can go off on their own and spin memory, plan, fantasy and so forth. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=348) |  You have a fundamental contrast between auditory, visual and somatic. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=356) |  And then across here you have a somewhat more objective side and a somewhat more subjective |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=362) |  side. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=363) |  Now a third level of contrast is between the ordinary sensory activity, touch, sight, sound, |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=371) |  feel, image, talk, and corresponding restful states. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=376) |  For example, when you're focusing on external sound, it might happen that there's not any |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=382) |  sound. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=383) |  That's an interesting experience. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=384) |  That's a restful state and you can note that as silence. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=389) |  What's even more interesting is if you happen to be focusing on internal talk and it goes |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=393) |  away, well, I have a term for that experience. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=398) |  I call that quiet. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=400) |  So you have some restful states here. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=404) |  If you don't have any images, you can be aware of mental blank. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=409) |  Or even if you have images, there's a way that I teach people to focus on a background |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=415) |  of blank. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=417) |  You can defocus your external sight. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=419) |  Your eyes are still open, but you're just sort of letting light in. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=424) |  That's a restful state corresponding to external sight that's used by many different people. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=432) |  Samurai, for example, used to intentionally soft focus their eyes in practicing martial |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=439) |  arts. |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=440) |  So that's another restful state. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=442) |  The contrast with sight, I call that light. |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=445) |  And then contrasting with touch is the physical relaxation of the body. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=450) |  And contrasting with feel is its absence, which I call emotional peace. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=456) |  So this gives us a contrast between somatic visual auditory, a contrast between subjective |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=468) |  reactive proactive versus objective experience, and then a contrast between ordinary experience |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=478) |  and corresponding pleasant restful states. |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=483) |  So these are the basic states. |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skl5LE7Uucg&t=486) |  And I build different mindfulness systems based on these states. |
