    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=11) |  However, I would say that in the end, the most significant learning about equanimity |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=16) |  comes about by what you described initially, which is it just sort of happens to you |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=21) |  and you notice it, and you notice its effect. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=25) |  How can you bring equanimity to an experience? |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=29) |  Well, you can try to physically relax the body. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=34) |  That tends to open the body, and that tends to open consciousness. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=38) |  So if you can keep the body physically relaxed as various sensory phenomena are arising, |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=45) |  that's something that you can intentionally do that would tend to create equanimity. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=51) |  You can attempt to intentionally create talk that sort of welcomes whatever is coming up, |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=60) |  or you can attempt to sort of disregard talk that judges, or a sort of combined strategy, |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=71) |  you replace judging talk with accepting talk, because we have a certain control over internal talk. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=80) |  So you can use your control over talk and your control over the relaxation of the body |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=87) |  to create equanimity to a certain extent. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=91) |  But there's only a limited extent to which a person can do that. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=96) |  And mostly you just wait for it to happen. You drop into it. It's a numbers game. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=105) |  And then when you drop into it, you notice it's happened, and you notice the effect of it on your sense of happiness, |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=114) |  and that creates a positive conditioning loop. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=118) |  It's important to also understand that if you can't have equanimity, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=126) |  meaning you can't control the tensing in your body and the judging in your mind, |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=131) |  then have equanimity with the non-equanimity. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=136) |  Go to that and just observe and accept the tension and observe and accept the judgments. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=142) |  So that either you have equanimity or you have equanimity with your lack of equanimity, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsnvgsEYqkw&t=147) |  which is a second-order equanimity, would be my recommendations. |
