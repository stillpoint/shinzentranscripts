    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=0) |  What is the origin of the word civilization? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=7) |  At the beginning of Western civilization, |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=10) |  there was, back in the 6th century BC in Greece, was Pythagoras. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=16) |  And Pythagoras had a remarkable notion. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=21) |  A notion that somehow the nature of the material world |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=26) |  and the nature of the inner world of thought, emotion, and spirit |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=35) |  and the nature of number were somehow linked. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=40) |  And if you could figure that out, |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=42) |  then you would have a complete model |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=48) |  that would cover all the needs of humanity. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=54) |  One of the problems, there were, as I look upon it, three problems. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=60) |  One is his notion of the nature of number was too limited. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=67) |  Essentially, it was positive whole integers. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=70) |  The second is that they didn't have the experimental method to explore nature. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=77) |  That only developed with Galileo, Francis Bacon, Newton, |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=82) |  and his optics, for example, and then subsequent researchers, scientists. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=89) |  And the other thing ancient Greeks lacked was methods of developing |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=97) |  enough concentration power systematically to explore the nature of the inner world. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=105) |  So they didn't know how to make experiments to explore the nature of the outer world. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=110) |  And they didn't have the technology of high concentration that India did have |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=117) |  that you need in order to explore the inner world. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=121) |  And they didn't have an adequate concept of number in order to model either one. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=130) |  But I think that we now are in a position to fulfill the Pythagorean agenda |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=138) |  because we now have a notion of number that's broad enough. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=143) |  Both the outer dance and the inner dance can be modeled with our present number system |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=153) |  because it has enough contrasts built in to explore the different flavors |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=160) |  of expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=162) |  The West has discovered the concentration methods from the East. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=167) |  We have the experimental method for looking at the outside nature. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=174) |  There's a teaching in Mahayana Buddhism that all beings have the Buddha nature. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=186) |  The Greek word for nature, the thing that Pythagoras and Western civilization |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=193) |  from his time on wanted to study, the word was physis, |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=198) |  and that's given us the word physics, for example. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=201) |  Physics is the study of the nature of things. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=204) |  I think that the confluence of the empirical method, |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=213) |  the focus techniques from the East, empirical means experimental method, |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=221) |  and the ability to mathematically model the results of experiments on the outside, |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=230) |  and now in this century we'll start to model the results of experiments |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=235) |  on the inside mathematically, we'll be able to achieve the Pythagorean agenda. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=243) |  As a result of that, it's easy for me to imagine that there could be, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=254) |  I don't say this will happen because who knows, |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=257) |  I just say it's not hard for me to imagine that the human condition |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=265) |  in the next century could change rapidly and globally and dramatically for the better. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=278) |  I think that every one of us that follows this path has a little role, perhaps, |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TdC2vT0r48&t=289) |  in what could be one of the most important events in all of history. |
