    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=23) |  That's the world of thought and emotion. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=28) |  We have internal control over it to a certain extent, particularly talk. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=34) |  We can decide to create a certain talk and repeat it over and over again. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=41) |  Essentially that's a mantra practice. |

    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=49) |  If you have irrational talk going on, irrational cognitions that are word-based, you can selectively |

    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=85) |  We can also hold positive images. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=89) |  Once again, they can be either more rational images, or they can be images of behavior |

    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=127) |  It's pretty easy for most people to intentionally create a positive dimension in talk and hold |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=135) |  that. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=136) |  A little harder for image, but doable by many people. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=140) |  Feel is even harder, but it's doable. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=142) |  You can actually learn in a systematic way to turn on positive feel. |

    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzRq0iRibv0&t=160) |  Intentionally creating, holding, and radiating positive states in one or a pair or all three |
