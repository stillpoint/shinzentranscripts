    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=0) |  Sounds True Studios likes to have a style with their presentations that is exemplified |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=14) |  by the name of the studio, Sounds True. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=18) |  In other words, they don't like their authors to read materials. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=26) |  That doesn't sound true. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=28) |  They want the author to extemporize the material. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=32) |  So that's how we made the Science of Enlightenment. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=34) |  It was really cool. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=36) |  We did it in Colorado, where their studios are located. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=42) |  And what they did is they got about a dozen or so of my students to come every day for, |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=56) |  gee, I think about a week, actually, and just listen to me talk all day. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=62) |  In other words, we sent out a mailing to my students in Colorado who would like to do |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=68) |  this. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=69) |  You've got to come to the studio every day, and there'll be chairs, and I'm going to talk |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=76) |  to you and just give you a brain dump of my understanding of the meditative path so that |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=84) |  it will have that quality of being spontaneous and spoken. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=91) |  So that's how we did it. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=94) |  I did have a general outline of what I was going to talk about on cards, but nothing |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=103) |  specific, certainly not any text or anything. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=106) |  But it's like, okay, there's this topic, this topic, this topic. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=110) |  So I had those cards, and I had the audience, and I just blabbered all day into the microphone |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=121) |  for about a week. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=122) |  And they came every single day, the same people came, and they listened to it so that there |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=126) |  was that sense of presence that I was really talking to somebody. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=132) |  So it had that sound of truth to it that Tammy, who created Sounds True, so much values in |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=142) |  her products. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=145) |  So that's how we did it. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=149) |  In the end, we had twice the length of material that appeared in the actual end product. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=159) |  So that had to be edited, and it took months for Michael Taft, who is this very, very sharp, |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=168) |  intelligent guy, to edit it down, to cut it in half of what we had dumped. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=175) |  And that became that classic that so many people have found useful. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=180) |  I should say that Michael and I are now working on a text version of it. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=185) |  Tammy hired him to do that. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=190) |  We thought we would just transcribe it and do a little touch-up, vetting and whatever, |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=199) |  but it turns out we're going to need a radical makeover. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=204) |  So it's taken a lot more time than any of us thought. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=210) |  But there will be a book based on the science of enlightenment that should come out sometime |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1VPN5lugw&t=217) |  in the next Kalpa. |
