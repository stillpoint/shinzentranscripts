    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=0) |  I'm going to do a little bit of a demonstration of that. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=15) |  That came to represent for me a tangible experience of not just an integration of my thoughts |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=23) |  and emotions, but the integration of my whole body, mind, self. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=27) |  So I still don't like discomfort, okay? |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=33) |  But I know now that whenever I have to face discomfort, it will lead eventually to this |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=42) |  same experience. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=43) |  I've come to expect that to happen on a regular basis, eventually. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=50) |  And the experience is that the entire body, mind becomes unified. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=56) |  And it's a really delicious experience. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=58) |  Anyway, that's oneness at an even larger scale. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=63) |  So we can have the oneness of the thoughts and emotions, but we can also have the oneness |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=68) |  of thoughts and emotions, and the emotionality and the physicality of the body. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=76) |  So most people would define themselves as a body-mind entity. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=84) |  When you get body-mind unified as flow, then that's an integration of yourself. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=97) |  But how about the outside world? |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=98) |  How about the world of sights and sounds? |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=102) |  What I just described was a kind of other, the touch, and my feel-image-talk, which is |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=110) |  sort of the perceiver, the it of the touch and the me of the fit, the feel-image-talk, |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=120) |  becoming a single flow, united. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=124) |  When you have a complete experience of sight, external seeing, and at the same time you |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=132) |  have a complete experience of your thoughts and emotions about what you see, then the |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=139) |  exact same thing happens. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=141) |  Your eye never fixates on the external side of the flower, for example, here. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=146) |  So the flower is a flow of light, of colored light, and the eye looking at the flower is |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=159) |  a flow of feel-image-talk colorations, you might say. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=165) |  And those two flow together, and that gives a unification of inside and outside along |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=174) |  this dimension. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=176) |  And even easier for most people is with sound. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=181) |  That's probably why people like music so much, because whether they know it or not, they |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=188) |  can have an experience of merging or oneness with the music. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=192) |  But if you understand the sensory components and how allowing your thoughts and reactions |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=202) |  to the music to arise without any interference, so they just flow, they're suffused with concentration, |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=212) |  clarity, and equanimity, so they become simply a flow of energy. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=217) |  And the music itself is relatively easy for people to experience that as a flow of energy. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=221) |  The hard part is to experience the listener as a flow of energy. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=226) |  What I found interesting when I asked people about their experiences of music, people that |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=231) |  weren't meditators, right? |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=234) |  Lots of people talked about the music gives them a kind of energy. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=239) |  And that means that although they don't quite have the categories clear and they don't quite |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=244) |  realize the potential, when they're having that kind of, quote, energy with the music, |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=250) |  the music is beginning to cease being a thing and it's starting to become a flow, a doing. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=264) |  But that's the easy part. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=265) |  The hard part is you're going to have thoughts and emotions that react to that music. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=271) |  To experience them with so much concentration, clarity, that they flow. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=277) |  And the music is also flowing, so the music and the listener literally become a single, |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=286) |  integrated arabesque of empty energy. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=291) |  And if you can do it with music, you can do it with ordinary sounds. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=296) |  And if you can do it with ordinary sounds, you can do it with annoying sounds like somebody |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=300) |  breathing in the meditation hall when they're not supposed to, or your neighbor's blasting |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=304) |  the stereo, or you have to room with somebody that's snoring, et cetera, et cetera. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=310) |  So you have these various rageful reactions to the sonic invasion. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=317) |  Well, that's feel-image-talk. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=320) |  And then there's the flow of the sound. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=322) |  It turns out that impermanence, flow, change is the great integrator. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=331) |  It integrates the head and the heart. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=335) |  It integrates the mind and the body. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=339) |  It integrates the inside and the outside. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=343) |  It's a vacuous integration, though. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=345) |  It's a one and a zero at the same time. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=353) |  In addition to integrating the head and the heart, the mind and the body, the inside and |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=359) |  the outside, there's an even more awesome level of integration. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=366) |  We could say that broadly, touch, sight, sound is it, and feel-image-talk is me, broadly. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=378) |  So self and world can be integrated. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=384) |  But there's one more contrast, deeper than the contrast between I and it, is the contrast |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=396) |  between both of us and the formless source. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=403) |  In other words, between creation and creator, if we want to use a somewhat Western paradigm. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=416) |  When that connection becomes integrated, when there is one with the zero, the ultimate zero, |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=429) |  that's the ultimate integration. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSEuHTXJ3SA&t=432) |  That's the experience of living nirvana. |
