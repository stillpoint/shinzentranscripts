    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=0) |  I'd like you to take a moment to stretch your spine up and then let your whole body settle. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=14) |  Sort of relax for a moment into the posture and tune into the pleasantness of the body |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=23) |  being still and reposed. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=43) |  Now sometimes there can be pleasant emotional sensation that's just there in your body, |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=52) |  maybe for no particular reason, like there's an interest or pleasant excitement or a kind |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=60) |  of smiley-ness or rosy-ness or something like that. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=66) |  I'd like you to go into your bodily experience and see if at this time, if there's anything |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=74) |  that's sort of pleasant sensation that could be considered an emotion like interest, enthusiasm, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=86) |  joy, smile, that kind of thing. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=89) |  There may or may not be. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=91) |  Either is fine. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=93) |  Just sort of take a look for a moment. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=99) |  Sometimes just having a conversation. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=102) |  It's sort of fun, right? |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=103) |  You smile and so forth. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=105) |  So it makes a kind of interested juice in the body. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=128) |  And would you say there's anything like that at this time? |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=131) |  Yeah, as soon as you say smile or joy, the word is there. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=135) |  It's just sort of there, just saying the word. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=138) |  Good. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=139) |  I would like you to tune into that smiley, joyous flavor as broadly as it's present in |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=146) |  the body and any other pleasant thing, including laughter, humor, anything that's emotional |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=157) |  and pleasant, and sort of see how broadly it's present in your body and sort of cover |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=165) |  it with awareness and focus all your attention on that. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=172) |  If it completely evaporates, that's okay. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=177) |  But as long as it's there, just focus in on it. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=182) |  And if anything else pulls your attention away, gently return to finding positive feel |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=192) |  in your body. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=194) |  Does that instruction make sense? |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=198) |  So what if it just goes away? |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=200) |  If it goes away and doesn't come back, I'd like you to tell me, and then we'll take it |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=206) |  from there. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=217) |  So what if it just sort of settles into calmness? |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=222) |  Meaning it sort of went away, is that correct? |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=224) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=225) |  Does that count as another positive sensation? |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=228) |  Okay, excellent question. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=230) |  If it settles into calmness, it means that there's actually no pleasant sensation there |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=237) |  for a moment. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=239) |  We'll call that a form of emotional relaxation. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=243) |  However, you can open your eyes if you want for a second. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=248) |  Now you feel pleasant, like we're smiling, right? |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=251) |  It's sort of fun talking, whatever. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=252) |  But now you're aware of it in your body, right? |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=255) |  When it hits on your face, because we've been working with it. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=258) |  The approach that we're using right now is what I call finding positive feel in the body. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=265) |  In other words, you just look and see if it's there. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=269) |  Without an agenda, it's either there or it's not. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=272) |  If it is there, then you focus on it with all your attention. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=276) |  And then if it goes away for just a moment, then okay, be aware that there's a kind of |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=282) |  emotional peace, you're emotionally relaxed. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=285) |  And then either you'll find yourself smiling again because of that, and you sort of get |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=290) |  into a cycle of emotional relaxation, creating joy, okay, and then that sort of going into |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=297) |  this peaceful state and then creating joy. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=300) |  So you might get into a cycle like that. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=303) |  The other thing that might happen though is the pleasant feel might go away and not come |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=308) |  back. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=309) |  Finding positive feel in the body is just one strategy for the whole positive technique. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=318) |  There's lots of other things we can do. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=320) |  We can create it in addition to finding it. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=323) |  So I'm going to take you through a whole systematic procedure. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=326) |  We'll start with like you're smiling now, okay, you can find the pleasant feel right |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=329) |  now. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=330) |  It's spreading, okay, totally open to it. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=332) |  Experience your whole body. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=333) |  I have a question. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=335) |  When you say it disappears for a moment or it settles down to emotional calmness, isn't |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=344) |  that also associated with positivity? |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=346) |  Like if I associate that as being positive for me, that feels good. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=352) |  Excellent question. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=354) |  It is true that in ordinary colloquial English, positive can mean anything, okay. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=359) |  It can mean a huge range of things. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=362) |  Emotional states could be positive or energy flow and some people call that positive. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=369) |  So in ordinary colloquial English, the word positive has a broad meaning. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=375) |  In this particular system, we'll only use positive in a very special restricted way. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=381) |  It will be either image, talk or feel that in some way is positive for you. |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=387) |  So you don't feel restful? |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=391) |  Not strictly speaking within this system, okay. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=394) |  You're aware of body rest, but we will restrict the word feel or feeling to refer to emotional |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=403) |  sensations which if they're pleasant, we'll call them positive feel. |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=408) |  This once again is just a matter of convention in language. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=413) |  Remember, being very clear within a certain system with regards to what words mean requires |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=421) |  a little bit of investment initially and may seem a little artificial and perhaps even |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=426) |  a little bit fussy. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=429) |  But in the end, it really pays off because we'll know exactly what we're talking about. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=435) |  So once again, take a moment to stretch up, settle in. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=448) |  And now bring your attention to your emotional body. |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=453) |  And it's possible for some reason, maybe the circumstance or what have you, that there's |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=459) |  some interest, joy, smiley, humorous, whatever, even if it's just because I said the words. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=469) |  If so, tune into that and zoom out, sort of cover it as broadly as it may be present. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=476) |  If it completely vanishes, fine. |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=480) |  If it comes back, focus on it. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=485) |  But if it doesn't come back, that's fine too, then let me know and we'll explore something |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLzTRHay_Tw&t=490) |  else. |
