    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=0) |  That's Zen birthing, or mindful birthing. |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=8) |  Then there's Zen parenting. |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=11) |  That's your monastery. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=14) |  So the source blasts you away in birthing and then expects you to function immediately |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=21) |  and big time. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=23) |  So just function. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=24) |  You become the... |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=25) |  It's like Zen, okay? |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=26) |  You get blown away in your San Zen interview and then you have to go do a job. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=32) |  But there's no you left, so you just do the job. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=35) |  You become the activity. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=36) |  You just function. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=37) |  I mentioned in Zen you have these interviews with the Zen master, right? |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=43) |  Mostly what you go for in an interview, people think they're going to solve these koans, |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=49) |  like what's the sound of one hand clapping and things. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=51) |  And you are, but mostly you're going to have an experience of merging with the expansion, |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=59) |  contraction, and emptiness of that Zen master. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=63) |  So it's sort of like some of their dynamic nothingness rubs off on you each time you |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=70) |  do a San Zen interview and then you carry that back to the meditation hall. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=76) |  That's how that works. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=77) |  But then, unlike the Shakti part that the Hindus do, where you sort of get zapped and |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=83) |  then you just sort of sit around and sing and worship the guru and have some grub, in |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=89) |  Zen you get the zap and then you got to go bust your ass in the meditation hall and it's |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=95) |  cold and they're beating you and they're yelling at you. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=97) |  You got to apply it right to this like, you know, you may think you got some energy or |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=104) |  picked up something, well now let's see if you can use it with your aching legs and your |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=108) |  aching psyche in this Zen torture chamber. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=115) |  Now we'll see, did you really get it? |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=117) |  And of course, why that's so cool is that then you're not a leaky capacitor that just |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=122) |  like gets charged and then loses it. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=124) |  You develop the strength, you can hold that and you don't become dependent on the teacher |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=128) |  for that energy. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=130) |  So because you're forced to use it and you're forced to be strong, it's not just, okay, |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=134) |  we're going to let the gurus zap us and then sit around and talk about how great the guru |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=140) |  is. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=141) |  You have to like apply it to real stuff right away. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=146) |  So that's why I like the Zen approach to it. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=148) |  They talk about transferring the consciousness but not in quite explicitly the terms I'm |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=153) |  using with you now. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=155) |  So you go, you pick up something of the dynamic nothingness of that Roshi and then you carry |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=162) |  it back. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=163) |  So when I look at Zen parenting, using Zen here in a sort of metaphorical way, is that |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=170) |  your baby is the Zen master. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=175) |  Because the baby is dynamic nothingness. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=180) |  It's still linked to the source. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=181) |  So every time you're interacting with the baby, you are, you're having a Zen interview. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=189) |  That's your little Roshi, okay? |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=192) |  And you can see the flow of expansion, contraction and zero inside the baby and it rubs off on |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=203) |  you. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=204) |  So you're getting shaktipat from your own baby through touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=210) |  Then you ride on that and you're able to use it for the challenges of taking care of the |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=216) |  baby. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=222) |  That's one way to think about the parenting. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=227) |  So it's pretty cool, huh? |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=229) |  It's very cool, yeah. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=231) |  Any questions about any of this? |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=234) |  You've talked about, and forgive me if I don't phrase it correctly, but sometimes we will, |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=243) |  like the raw fear will come up and you've said it's like an infant state of fear. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=252) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=253) |  I understand what you're talking about. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=255) |  And I really appreciate you bringing that up because I've had an experience like that |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=263) |  and now it gives me so much compassion when a baby cries or gets upset and we may or may |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=272) |  not know why that is, but by me experiencing that and by you letting me know that that's |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=285) |  the raw feel emotion that an infant feels, I think it will let me have a lot more love |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=291) |  and compassion for that child when they experience something like that. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=298) |  Let me ask you. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=301) |  I want to make sure I know what we're talking about. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=305) |  Is it having the experience of a sort of chaotic activity within feel space inside yourself, |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=315) |  like you dropped into a very primitive level and there was just sort of like a chaotic |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=321) |  feel for no particular reason, just sort of like an amoeba doing a thing deep down there? |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=327) |  Is that what you're alluding to? |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=328) |  Yes, but it was a huge chaotic fear. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=333) |  Was it just fear or was it other sensations mixed in? |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=337) |  I think it was just fear, but it was really big and then I just went grasping for an image |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=345) |  or something to equate how big that fear was to something that I could identify with and |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=354) |  it was a terrible criminal situation, it was the image that just came in my mind. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=360) |  That's how big the fear was, but it was just the fear at the beginning. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=365) |  So you experienced like raw fear in feel space for no reason whatsoever? |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=370) |  No reason, no. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=371) |  And it was just like a chaotic arising and then you applied the practice to that? |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=378) |  Let me think back, it was a couple retreats ago. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=389) |  I'm not sure if I applied the practice or not. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=391) |  I think I was just shocked because it was so strong. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=394) |  You were shocked at how primitive and irrational feel space can be. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=399) |  But now you know that when you watch the baby sort of doing its stuff, that's its feel space |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=405) |  expanding and contracting, so this gives you a sense that you have an experiential sense |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=413) |  of what the baby is going through when it's in its primordial freakout. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=418) |  Yes, yes. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=420) |  And instead of going, what's wrong? |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=424) |  It's like all of a sudden there's a huge amount of compassion because of what I experienced. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=431) |  Well that's excellent. |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=433) |  When time gets closer to that event, I'd probably like to talk to you about it, about the birthing |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=439) |  process. |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=440) |  Sure. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=441) |  Again, you have left me with a lot of excitement and I was on another retreat with you when |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=449) |  someone went into I think labor on an online and then went to the hospital and she came |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=454) |  back and described it during the talking circle. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=457) |  I think she was in labor for a huge amount of time and she talked about how the nurses |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=462) |  and doctors were completely shocked at how she was in labor for so long and they were |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=468) |  amazed at how well she did. |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=474) |  It was absolutely amazing. |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=477) |  Well, this is good. |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=483) |  So I think we're good? |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUGigTkD20g&t=485) |  Yes, thank you. |
