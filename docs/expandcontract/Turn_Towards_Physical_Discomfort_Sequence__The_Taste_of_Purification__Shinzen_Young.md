    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=0) |  Now we know what the it is in the case of physical discomfort. |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=8) |  It's the local uncomfortable touch, possibly the global spread, and possibly feel-image-talk |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=15) |  reactions. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=16) |  That's the it. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=17) |  However, I'm giving you general principle that you can apply to any sensory challenge. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=23) |  Now there's a tendency to think that, oh, if I'm going to turn towards it, I have to |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=30) |  turn towards the most horrible, intense, solidified part of it. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=38) |  However, that is, although there's nothing wrong with that, that is certainly not necessarily |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=43) |  the case. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=45) |  Where I like to start is I look at the sensory challenge and I ask myself, what's the weakest |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=51) |  link? |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=53) |  Which component in the sensory challenge is least intense? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=57) |  I'm going to go for that first. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=60) |  Typically for me, I find that at least at the beginning of the discomfort, the least |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=67) |  intense components are actually the feel-image-talk reactions. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=72) |  They're not too strong yet. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=73) |  They're just a subtle hint. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=76) |  So often I'll start with that. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=77) |  I won't even go to the uncomfortable touch. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=81) |  I'll go to, OK, what's going on in feel-image-talk reactive to this, or in general, what's going |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=87) |  on? |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=88) |  Because I know if at some point I lose it and freak out, the freak out is not in touch |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=93) |  space. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=94) |  The freak out is in fit space. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=96) |  So I want to get some momentum going in. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=99) |  And if at some point I become unwilling to practice, like to hell with this, et cetera, |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=106) |  et cetera, that's going to happen in fit space. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=109) |  Not in the physical body. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=111) |  Touch space can take a lot. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=113) |  Feel-image-talk space is pretty vulnerable. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=117) |  So I start in feel-image-talk. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=120) |  Then when I go to touch, I try to detect the subtle global spread, if I can. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=127) |  And after many, many years of practice, usually I can. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=131) |  And I work with that. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=133) |  It's widespread, but it's not that intense relative to what's happening locally. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=137) |  So I sort of work with that. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=138) |  I note that touch, touch, sort of zoom into those things. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=143) |  Sometimes zoom out to try to get the whole spread at once, which does help with the dissipating. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=149) |  Zoom in means work with a small part. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=151) |  Zoom out means sort of spread the attention over the whole thing. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=155) |  Then I go into the local intensities, which is, that's the strongest link. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=162) |  So when you work with the sensory challenge, you can focus away, or you can focus on it. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=169) |  When you focus on it, you want to get a very clear classification of the sensory challenge, |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=174) |  all its components. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=176) |  And then decide, well, do I want to go to this, which component do I want to go to? |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=180) |  Do I want to work with them all at once, et cetera, et cetera? |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=184) |  So like I say, I typically work with the weakest link, and then I sort of work my way up. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=190) |  And then I work with it all at once. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=193) |  But usually by that time, it's breaking up into flow, meaning that it's not so solid |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=200) |  anymore. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=201) |  It's beginning to show waviness, bubbliness, that kind of stuff. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=206) |  So now I'm noting touch, feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=211) |  But it gets very flowy. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=213) |  So at some point, I'm just zooming out, and I'm covering touch, feel, image, talk, all |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=220) |  four simultaneously as a flow field. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=224) |  They integrate into a single body-mind arabesque of energy. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=229) |  And if it works right, I just get this flavor of purification. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=238) |  I get this sense that because of the way that I'm experiencing this moment, every moment |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=246) |  of my life in the future is going to involve less suffering and more fulfillment. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=253) |  And furthermore, the poison and pain that has been stored from the past is getting worked |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=258) |  out. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=259) |  So the present is reaching into the future, making a brighter future for me. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=264) |  And the present is reaching back into the past and cleaning that up for me. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=269) |  I call that experience the flavor of purification. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=275) |  Probably the most important watershed in a person's practice is when they start to develop |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=283) |  an awareness of that flavor. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=285) |  Because after that, it takes off like a hockey stick. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=290) |  It's exponential, because now you're getting a reward, an actual reward for your mindfulness. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=299) |  You're actually tasting not when the retreat's over or when the sit's over, but like right |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=308) |  now in this instant, you're tasting that this is doing something significant and productive |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=315) |  for you. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=317) |  So there's a reward there. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=319) |  I personally have seen people sit for three days without moving. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=329) |  And I can tell you how it's done. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=330) |  It's done with a smile on the face. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=334) |  So it's like, what? |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=337) |  Somebody's genetically engineered to do this? |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=339) |  A human can do this? |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=341) |  No, a human can train themselves along the lines of what I just said, so that the sense |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=349) |  of, this is meaningful and purgatorial, as opposed to meaningless and hellish, that sense |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=359) |  is present moment by moment. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=361) |  And so there's a smile on the face, even though the pain is hour after hour, right on the |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=369) |  cusp of fainting intensity. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=372) |  And this is the easy thing. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=376) |  Now you want to know what the hard thing is? |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=381) |  This isn't that easy, I know. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=384) |  But relative to something else, this is relatively easy. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=388) |  When the uncomfortable touch breaks up, you're beginning to have a complete experience of |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=394) |  uncomfortable touch. |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=396) |  When the uncomfortable touch turns into purification flavor, you're well on your way to complete |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=403) |  experience. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=404) |  And you remember I talked last night about the two things, getting over the self and |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=411) |  the world and improving the self and the world. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=416) |  And you get over the self and the world by having what I call a complete experience of |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=421) |  yourself and the world. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=423) |  The relatively easy thing is to have a complete experience of uncomfortable touch. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0L7_lEFqk&t=431) |  The harder thing is to have a complete experience of uncomfortable feel. |

     Now we know what the it is in the case of physical discomfort. It's the local uncomfortable touch, possibly the global spread, and possibly feel-image-talk reactions. That's the it.

They're just a subtle hint. So often I'll start with that. I won't even go to the uncomfortable touch. I'll go to, OK, what's going on in feel-image-talk reactive to this, or in general, what's going on? Because I know if at some point I lose it and freak out, the freak out is not in touch space. The freak out is in fit space. So I want to get some momentum going in. And if at some point I become unwilling to practice, like to hell with this, et cetera, et cetera, that's going to happen in fit space. Not in the physical body. Touch space can take a lot.
