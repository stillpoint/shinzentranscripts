    | [00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=2) |  Hi. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=28) |  What do you dare ask? |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=39) |  These all relate to spaciousness. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=50) |  Part of the definition is thinness within, openness around, or both that may present |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=55) |  themselves in sensory spaces. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=58) |  That's the best I could do. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=62) |  So let's start with that. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=69) |  When you first brought in the term spaciousness, I thought it's just like he's making a special |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=79) |  case of expansion and contraction and kind of giving it its own term. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=85) |  The openness is like expansion and the thinness is like contraction. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=90) |  And then you said you brought it in to represent the four formless absorptions, etc. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=100) |  Roughly yes. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=101) |  Okay. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=102) |  It's not a one-to-one correspondence, but I think of it as moving people in that direction. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=113) |  Okay. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=115) |  So I have kind of several things in this area that I wanted to get your response to. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=125) |  So one is when the Tibetans talk about spacious awareness, is that part of how you think about |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=136) |  it? |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=137) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=138) |  That was another source. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=140) |  The Theravada dhyanas or jhanas, the whole Tibetan thing around space with Dzogchen and |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=148) |  Mahabhutra, and then Sasaki Roshi's formulation, he used the word space a lot. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=157) |  So I saw a way of integrating those traditions, roughly. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=175) |  I think Harprakash froze up. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=180) |  He's going through a cessation. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=184) |  It happens. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=185) |  It has happened before. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=189) |  He had a cessation in the scanner at Harvard Medical School. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=206) |  We caught it on camera. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=207) |  I don't know if Dave Vago, what he ever did with it. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=212) |  That actually happened. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=217) |  He was in the scanner and he just turned off for a little while. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=227) |  Well, I guess now gone. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=232) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=233) |  Maybe we should go to someone else until he re-arises. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=243) |  Yeah we can reconnect as soon as he does. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=247) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=248) |  Harprakash yet, unless if I'm missing you, please unmute Harprakash. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=254) |  Otherwise we'll go to- |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=255) |  Hey, I'm back. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=256) |  Oh, great. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=257) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=258) |  Where are you? |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=259) |  Where am I? |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=265) |  I'm right here. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=266) |  Where are you? |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=267) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=268) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=269) |  Apologies. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=270) |  I slipped into gone for a while. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=275) |  I made a big joke about it. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=278) |  I told them about when we were at Harvard and you had that cessation thing. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=285) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=286) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=287) |  Let's see. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=291) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=293) |  So let's stick with the spaciousness part. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=312) |  So you said among other things, you brought it into representative, the Aruba Jones, the |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=319) |  four formless absorptions. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=322) |  And you also said that when spaciousness goes with dynamic flow, that there's lots of opportunities |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=336) |  there. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=338) |  And my association with spacious awareness from Tibetan Buddhism. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=353) |  So why did you make, if I can see spaciousness as just a form of expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=363) |  why did you make that its own specific theme? |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=368) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=370) |  So the |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=389) |  descriptions don't necessarily classically mention anything |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=404) |  about energy or flow or impermanence. |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=411) |  It's just sort of a description, boundless space, nothing whatsoeverness, boundless consciousness. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=430) |  And going so deep that you're right on the border of even being conscious or not conscious. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=441) |  These are the names of the four formless jhanas. |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=447) |  The boundless consciousness is, once again, I'm just reporting my own experience. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=457) |  So other people might be different, but for me, when you get to the base of all of the |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=465) |  archetypal material, you're basically in the multiverse of all stories. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=475) |  And then that seems, then you take it one more step and it's no story because all the |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=485) |  stories have now shrunk to a point. |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=491) |  And that seems like boundless consciousness. |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=500) |  And nothing whatsoeverness clearly is getting close to nirvana, if you were to abide there. |
    | [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=513) |  So what they do say, though, is that when you enter absorptions, this is more modern |
    | [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=530) |  terminology, but some teachers talk about a vipassana jhana, an absorption where there |
    | [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=538) |  is an insight component. |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=544) |  And usually the insight is impermanence. |
    | [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=549) |  So some absorption teachers will talk about these states and then they'll say something |
    | [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=559) |  like it can be a pure shamatha, in which case I'm guessing there's an emphasis on stability. |
    | [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=572) |  That's a guess. |
    | [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=574) |  Or it can be a vipassana jhana where you're aware of impermanence within the deep state. |
    | [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=582) |  So I wanted to be able to deal with spaciousness as its own independent dimension, allowing |
    | [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=599) |  for the possibility that it might stabilize and not be dynamical for a person. |
    | [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=609) |  And then pointing out that if flow in general is present, well, that's insight absorption. |
    | [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=620) |  But if expansion contraction flow is present, in other words, if the vastness doesn't just |
    | [00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=627) |  sit there, but it moves out, the thinness becomes the basis for an effortless crunch, |
    | [00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=637) |  a continuous crunch. |
    | [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=640) |  If that happens to present itself, that's very close to Sasaki Roshi's formulation of |
    | [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=649) |  the source. |
    | [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=651) |  So I wanted to take the fact that in the Tibetan formulations and in the absorptions from early |
    | [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=663) |  Buddhism, it is not necessarily explicitly mentioned that there would be flow. |
    | [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=674) |  What to say of explicitly that the expansion might in fact not just sit there, but move |
    | [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=682) |  out, be a force, likewise the contraction. |
    | [00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=686) |  They don't explicitly mention that. |
    | [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=688) |  It might be implicit or added on later. |
    | [00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=692) |  So in order to have a formulation that was sort of dimensionally clean, that would work |
    | [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=700) |  for a lot of different situations, I said, okay, the spaciousness is one thing. |
    | [00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=706) |  If flow is present within that, great. |
    | [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=710) |  If not, that's okay too. |
    | [00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=712) |  So it's the best I could do to integrate such a wide range of formulations. |
    | [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=723) |  Okay. |
    | [00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=726) |  And related to that, the spacious awareness, is that the equivalent to what you're... |
    | [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=739) |  I think I just used the word spaciousness. |
    | [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=742) |  I might use the phrase spacious awareness for exactly that same thing. |
    | [00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=750) |  It would just be synonymous. |
    | [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=753) |  Would have to look in the manual. |
    | [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=757) |  I don't remember what the official vocabulary is. |
    | [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=762) |  Okay. |
    | [00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0aqdzceUnk&t=764) |  Thank you. |

     You Hi. What do you dare ask? These all relate to spaciousness. Part of the definition is thinness within, openness around, or both that may present themselves in sensory spaces.

Harprakash yet, unless if I'm missing you, please unmute Harprakash. Otherwise we'll go to- Hey, I'm back. Oh, great. Okay. Where are you? Where am I? I'm right here. Where are you? Okay. Okay. Apologies. I slipped into gone for a while. I made a big joke about it. I told them about when we were at Harvard and you had that cessation thing. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Okay.
