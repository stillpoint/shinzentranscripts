    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=0) |  Another common misconception about concentration is that it will always require a lot of effort. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=14) |  Now it is true that initially, when you attempt to develop concentration, your attention wanders, |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=24) |  you bring it back, your attention wanders, you bring it back. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=27) |  This does require a certain amount of effort initially, |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=32) |  but it is not the case that it's always going to require that effort. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=39) |  A time comes when it's automatic and no longer effortful. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=48) |  Yes, you have to be willing to invest a certain amount of effort, |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=52) |  and even after it becomes effortless, there may be times when you're facing sensory challenges |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=58) |  when you have to effort again. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=61) |  But it's not the case that forever and ever and ever it's this huge Herculean or Sisyphean task |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=72) |  that you're undertaking. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=75) |  You train yourself to be able to maintain profound concentration states while doing it in a very complex or chaotic environment. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=85) |  And that's the dimension of growth of concentration that I refer to as it broadens, it encompasses more and more of life. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=96) |  So when I went into that 100-day training, I could sometimes get a little bit of flavor of concentration |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=108) |  through formal sitting, counting the breath, and I could get a little bit of concentration when I would do simple tasks. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=118) |  I came out 100 days later, and I was not the same person. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=126) |  I had been fundamentally re-engineered. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=129) |  It was a very small price to pay. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=131) |  You might think 100 days is a big price, is like a long time, and that's a big deal. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=137) |  It's a very small price to pay for a new life. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=143) |  But essentially after that, that taste of concentration was always present for me 24-7. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=153) |  Now, of course, as fun as it is to tell these horror stories or war stories about intense training in Asia, |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=162) |  it's also sort of not a good thing to tell people. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=165) |  Why? Why is this not a good thing to tell you? |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=169) |  Because if that's what you have to go through to get this, I don't think I'm going to sign up in this lifetime. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=175) |  It's the natural reaction. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=177) |  It's like, what, I'm going to have to torture myself with cold water for 100 days if I want to have perennial samadhi? |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=186) |  No, not necessary. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=189) |  In Buddhism, they have this concept called upaya or skillful means. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=194) |  You don't have to rely on brute force methods. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=198) |  You can work smart and get the same results. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=202) |  And my attempt to formulate the techniques and the concepts of this path in a very precise way |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=215) |  is my attempt to allow ordinary North American, or let's say modern people, |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=222) |  to allow you to get the same results that monastics get without the brute force methods. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=229) |  So, no, you don't have to go through this kind of thing in order to get comparable results. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=235) |  You can work smart. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AoNrGM0MBY&t=237) |  And, yes, you may have to amortize it over a longer period of time. |
