    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=0) |  And my eye interaction with the camera is good. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=26) |  Yeah, actually I'm enjoying it because it's like I'm talking to someone inside the camera. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=34) |  I can see a person inside that camera that I'm talking to. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=37) |  I mean in some weird way, not hallucinating way. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=43) |  Actually, it's a homunculus. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=45) |  Oh, it's me! |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=47) |  Reflected. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=48) |  I said, all the time we've been shooting this, but a cover on the lens, is that a problem? |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=58) |  I guess this is the metaphor. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=65) |  I guess this is the metaphor, right? |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=68) |  Or no, I guess... |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=69) |  We're filming this in Niagara Falls, Canada. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=78) |  So I have with me the actual icon itself of Canada. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=87) |  It's also an icon for where I live, Vermont. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=90) |  I think we're just about as good at this as you Canucks are. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=96) |  So... |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=108) |  Now, here's the metaphor. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=113) |  There is a general pattern that happens on the spiritual path. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=125) |  Filming? |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=126) |  Are we filming? |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=127) |  I'm going to ask you. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=129) |  Well, start filming. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=130) |  I'm filming. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=131) |  I'm farting right now. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=133) |  You wanted the guru farting on camera, now you got it. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=137) |  Okay, I'm going to try to do a close-up. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=145) |  This is pure Prana Shakti coming out of me, dude. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=149) |  Hey, let's face it, on these retreats, we get a little dumb, okay? |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=156) |  And that's good, okay? |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=158) |  Actually, that's good, because that's a sign that you're dropping deep. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=169) |  How's that? |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=171) |  What are your recommendations for surmounting the five hindrances in your mindfulness training? |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=181) |  You have to remind me what the five hindrances are. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=191) |  Sloth and torpor? |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=193) |  Yeah, that's exactly why you have to remind me. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=196) |  What the fuck does that mean? |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=206) |  I just couldn't resist that one. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=210) |  Join me on the dark side. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=228) |  Oh, wait, wait, wait, no. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=230) |  Here's the true crosses here, and here's Tim Horton's hockey stick. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=234) |  Which one do you worship? |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=237) |  I'll twist you around there. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=241) |  Twist me around? I've already twisted enough. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=244) |  I think that was a... we were even a little further twisted than that, don't you think? |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=248) |  I think he's really twisted. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=250) |  Yeah, no, no, no, we know that. It was a little further twisted than that. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=253) |  I don't remember being so twisted. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=256) |  I do. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=258) |  All right. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=259) |  How do I know if it's better for me to focus on developing concentration first, |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=266) |  and then applying that concentration to investigation, |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=269) |  or whether I should go with dry vipassana approach? |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=274) |  I don't know. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=277) |  Okay. Does formal meditation ever end? |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=282) |  No. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=284) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=286) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=289) |  We'll be out of here in a heartbeat. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=291) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=296) |  I'd like to read a quote to you, and I'd like your response. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=304) |  Another time when someone kept pushing Shunryu Suzuki to talk about enlightenment, |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=310) |  he replied, what do you want to know for? You may not like it. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=315) |  You'd like my response to that comment. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=318) |  Is that it? |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=320) |  No, I'm going to give a response. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=325) |  I'm not that Zen. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=342) |  Okay. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=344) |  Okay, roll. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=354) |  And this is where I show my Yiddish kite, my big Jewish punnama. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usFL7YstLnY&t=364) |  Good. |
