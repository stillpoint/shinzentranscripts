    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=5) |  Since my primary mission is to create a truly rigorous formulation, |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=16) |  just from my own personal perspective, |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=20) |  I'm duty-bound to present what I think is |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=26) |  the most precise scientific theory of what's actually going on, |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=31) |  which may not be the simplest one to teach to the masses. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=35) |  But unless we have a really deep, broad, and subtle theoretical understanding, |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=46) |  I think in the end we won't be able to teach effectively. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=50) |  So that's why I do that on purpose. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=53) |  That's a choice. I would prefer to teach the deeper, broader formulation, |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=60) |  even though people don't quite get it right away. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=73) |  Because I want the dialogue to progress through time. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=77) |  I want our understanding, our scientific understanding, to be able to evolve. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcEidBghfOA&t=83) |  So that's the reason I formulate it that way. |

     What is your primary mission? Since my primary mission is to create a truly rigorous formulation, just from my own personal perspective, I'm duty-bound to present what I think is the most precise scientific theory of what's actually going on, which may not be the simplest one to teach to the masses. But unless we have a really deep, broad, and subtle theoretical understanding, I think in the end we won't be able to teach effectively. So that's why I do that on purpose. That's a choice. I would prefer to teach the deeper, broader formulation, even though people don't quite get it right away. Because I want the dialogue to progress through time. I want our understanding, our scientific understanding, to be able to evolve. So that's the reason I formulate it that way.
