    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=0) |  Okay, we use metaphors for this practice. We meaning all the mindfulness teachers in the world. |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=9) |  And those metaphors are metaphors and if they help you, good, and if they get in the way, not good. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=15) |  One of the metaphors for equanimity is, and it's a standard one and it's used by very famous and |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=26) |  deep teachers, you sit on the bank of the river and watch it. But that is just a metaphor for equanimity. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=36) |  That's not what equanimity is, okay. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=45) |  One of the things about the way I teach that people often find weird is I don't actually |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=53) |  give you a whole base to go back to. A lot of people give you the breath, say okay, keep coming back to the breath. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=61) |  Why doesn't Shinzen do that? Well, not against it. It's a totally valid way to practice. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=69) |  But there is a reason why I don't give you a place to stand. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=74) |  And I quote no less an authority than one of the great enlightened masters of China, Lin Ji, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=86) |  who says, inside of every human being, there is an authentic person that has no position. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=107) |  The authentic human with no position. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=111) |  If I were to characterize the experience of Zen practice at Mount Baldy, I would say it is de-centering. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=126) |  You've heard of centering prayer? That's de-centering prayer. Gives you no place to stand. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=133) |  It's very disorienting. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=135) |  When you finally give up the notion that you're going to have a place to stand, |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=143) |  that's when that figure ground reversal takes place. That's when you're doing three-dimensional Zen, |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=149) |  as opposed to flat Zen, which would be the Zen put down of the way Vipassana is often done, |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=157) |  from a fixed perspective. I'm over here sitting on the riverbank, watching the river. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=170) |  Well, if that works right, at some point you will become the river without being caught in the river, |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=179) |  if it works right. But if it doesn't work right, you're going to spend 20 or 30 years on the bank of that river |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=185) |  and never be liberated. So I don't want you to have a place to stand. I don't want you to have a center. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=197) |  I want the center to have you. It's a completely different experience. It's intentional. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=206) |  So it is hugely not a problem if you cannot find a place to stand while you do Vipassana. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=214) |  It's like hugely not a problem. It will be a problem if you don't have some modicum of concentration, |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=222) |  clarity, and equanimity, though. But that's why I asked you the question about the spoken labels. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=228) |  Once I determined that you were doing something, then I could say with confidence, |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=234) |  absolutely do not try to find a place to stand in general, ever. And just let the place. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=245) |  I don't know if you know, but the very common word in ordinary Israeli Hebrew for God is hamakom. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyZPoIVOBS4&t=253) |  That means the place. The place. Let the place find you, rather than you find a place. |
