    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=11) |  It's complex and subtle. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=15) |  I give a lot of precise definitions of things and I have a lot of categories and relationships |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=24) |  between categories. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=26) |  So some people find this tedious. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=31) |  Of course I would say by way of defense that I'm trying to create an all-encompassing |

    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=65) |  Meaning that sometimes a certain degree of complexity is simply unavoidable if you are |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=72) |  looking for wide applicability. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=78) |  But a lot of people that are on a spiritual path get impatient with going back into elementary |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=87) |  school or middle school or high school and memorizing definitions and terminology and |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=94) |  so forth. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=95) |  So I understand that that complexity and subtlety might be off-putting to some people. |

    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=111) |  Well it's a personality trait. |

    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=120) |  I think I'm in the sharp compassion side, which he compared to a scalpel. |

    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=138) |  So I think I might be a little bit on the cold and sharp form of compassion as opposed |

    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPkA9oMPKDw&t=180) |  And I can have a perhaps a little bit over-the-top sense of humor sometimes about making fun |
