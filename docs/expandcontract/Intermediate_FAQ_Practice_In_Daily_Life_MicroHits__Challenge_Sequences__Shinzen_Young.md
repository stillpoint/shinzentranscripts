    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=0) |  Intermediate students, one of the very common questions is how can I bring the practice |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=12) |  into more into my daily life? |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=16) |  And the quick answer to that is if you want to achieve that laudable goal, like any other |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=24) |  project you have to take measures. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=27) |  It's a combination of yes, doing a formal practice, retreat and self-practice so that |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=35) |  there's a carryover into life, that's part of it. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=39) |  But then there are specific things that a person can do to assure that the practice |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=45) |  is going to influence their day-to-day ordinary life. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=50) |  One of the things that you can do is you can take short moments in the day, stop on a dime |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=58) |  and begin a mindfulness practice for 30 seconds here or three minutes there, right on the |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=66) |  fly when nothing too demanding is happening. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=70) |  I call that practice in life. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=72) |  You can just start sight, sight, feel, talk, image. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=84) |  Just start like that, the process of noting while I'm giving this talk. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=92) |  So doing that, peppering your day with that. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=96) |  And then the other thing is creating a challenge sequence where you take a technique and you |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=103) |  do it seated, eyes closed, seated, eyes open, standing, slow movement, slow movement in |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=112) |  an impactful environment. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=115) |  Then do the technique while doing a simple task, do the technique while doing more demanding |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=120) |  tasks. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=121) |  You create challenge sequences and you gradually work your way up until you can maintain the |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=129) |  technique in very, very complicated circumstances. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=133) |  So the combination of peppering the day at least a half dozen times every day, even if |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=140) |  just for a few seconds, you implement the practice on the fly. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=145) |  That plus creating challenge sequences which are analogous to adding more and more weights |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=151) |  or doing more and more reps in weight training. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=157) |  So you may sort of gradually pick up heavier and heavier weights. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=161) |  You train yourself to maintain the techniques you use in more and more complicated situations |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=167) |  gradually. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=169) |  So the challenge sequence plus the sort of surgical strikes during the day plus enough |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=175) |  momentum from formal practice, those three taken together will allow for the practice |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=183) |  to begin to inundate your entire life. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=186) |  So there's a figure ground reversal. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=188) |  At first meditation is one of the things you do in life. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=193) |  Eventually you have to reach the point where life is something that takes place inside |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSq9vKkLu4s&t=199) |  meditation. |

     Intermediate students, one of the very common questions is how can I bring the practice into more into my daily life? And the quick answer to that is if you want to achieve that laudable goal, like any other project you have to take measures.
