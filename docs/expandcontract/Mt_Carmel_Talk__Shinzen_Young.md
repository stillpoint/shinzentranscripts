    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=13) |  The teachings of the Buddha are not meant to be used as a tool for self-improvement. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=21) |  Teachers can't avoid making bad karma. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=24) |  Either we describe things that could happen and how to work with them, |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=29) |  which then will motivate you, give you a sense of what to look for, |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=33) |  and give you a sense of how to work with it, if it should occur. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=38) |  Either we do that or we don't. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=41) |  If we do that, we've done you a service and we've done you a disservice, |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=45) |  because those things may not occur, and it sets up all sorts of comparison mind, |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=51) |  and the medicine then becomes the poison. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=56) |  There's lots of different ways you could define enlightenment. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=62) |  One way that will help you perhaps be disabused of the comparison mind, |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=67) |  I'd like to tell this story, most of you have heard this story. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=71) |  Many years ago, I and another American Buddhist monk and a Japanese Zen Roshi, |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=79) |  the three of us were interviewed for Japanese television. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=83) |  The interviewer asked me the question, |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=88) |  サトリとは一体何ですか? |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=92) |  Now you might know the word Satori, that means enlightenment in Japanese, waking up. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=97) |  When you get right down to it, what is enlightenment? |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=100) |  I turned to the other American monk who was more senior than myself, |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=106) |  and he sort of turned to the Roshi. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=109) |  So that got passed on to the Roshi. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=112) |  And then there's the Yomi Roshi, whose lineage is very prominent in North America. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=117) |  Here you are, a Roshi. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=120) |  Presumably you know what enlightenment is, but now it's for the record, for the camera. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=127) |  For a half million people that are watching on television forever, you're on the spot. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=135) |  サトリとは一体何ですか? |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=137) |  When you get right down to it, what is enlightenment? |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=141) |  He goes, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=146) |  さあ、サトリとサトリでないとの区別がなくなることでしょう。 |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=159) |  I guess you could say it's the disappearance of the distinction between enlightenment and not enlightenment. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=170) |  意味を。 |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=178) |  As soon as you start thinking, what am I going to get enlightened? |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=183) |  Why is this one more enlightened than me? |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=185) |  Why haven't I experienced this? |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=187) |  What am I doing wrong? |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=189) |  You are making a distinction between enlightenment and not enlightenment. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=192) |  The quickest door to enlightenment right then and there, well, you know what it is. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=199) |  Stop making that distinction. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=201) |  If you keep that in mind, then people like me won't make so much bad karma by telling you all sorts of distinctions. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=212) |  As you give nature half a chance to gradually nurture your concentration, clarity, and equanimity skills over the weeks, months, years, for the duration, |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=231) |  there is a good probability that at some point that triple skill set, my definition of mindfulness, will reach a sufficient critical mass. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=242) |  So that if you chose to work with the theme of expansion and contraction in your senses, |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=249) |  if that was something you wanted to do, that would be available to you. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=256) |  If you read the classic text on vipassana or mindfulness meditation, the Visuddhimagga, |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=266) |  it means the path of purification, it was written by Bhuttakosa, |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=272) |  I don't know, maybe in the 5th century AD in Sri Lanka, written in the Pali language. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=280) |  There are some translations, it's not an easy read, that's for sure, even in translation. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=288) |  In any event, you will see he describes a point in one's development, |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=296) |  not very, rather close to the experience of stream entry or initial insight, enlightenment, if you will. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=309) |  There is a time when your awareness becomes dominated by the pattern of rising and passing. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=319) |  That is to say, things well up and then things subside. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=324) |  At a somewhat later stage, your attention becomes dominated by the pattern of |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=331) |  no sooner does it start to arise, but it's already passing. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=336) |  As soon as the time-space volume that a sensory event would occupy is arising, |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=342) |  that time-space volume is simultaneously collapsing. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=348) |  In other words, simultaneous expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=354) |  and then their neutralization into zero, is already explicitly described in the Pali literature. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=368) |  I am quite sure Sasaki Roshi never read those passages. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=372) |  He just experienced it in his own practice. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=376) |  But instead of describing it as something over there, where things are dying as soon as they are passing, |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=387) |  which is sort of like linear or two-dimensional, |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=392) |  he sets it up in this three-dimensional paradigm, |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=395) |  where you're not observing the simultaneous birth and death of space. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=407) |  You're not observing it. God would put you in some space over here, fixated. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=413) |  You're not observing it fixated. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=415) |  The observer is arising in the sphere itself. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=419) |  That just means feel, image, talk, and touch, and the world. |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=425) |  Your body-mind and your sight-sound, if you want to cut it up that way, |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=431) |  body-mind-self and the sight-sound-world, |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=434) |  they are arising both inside that time-space volume that is molding them through expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=452) |  That means that as you bop around in the world, as you look here, you look there, |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=462) |  you are participating in the activity of impermanence. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=468) |  You're participating in the source. |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=470) |  You're not observing the source. You're participating in the source. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=476) |  Maybe that's one of the differences between Zen training and vipassana. |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=481) |  In vipassana, you sort of observe impermanence, |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=485) |  and then if you do that long enough, it starts to inform the way your body moves, |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=490) |  and you ride on impermanence. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=493) |  In Zen, long before you ever actually see impermanence, |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=497) |  you're forced to, by the lifestyle and the koans and whatever, |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=501) |  you're forced to ride on impermanence, and then eventually you see impermanence. |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=506) |  But in the end, you want to come to both. |
    | [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=509) |  You want to be able to see impermanence and to manifest impermanence, to ride on impermanence. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=515) |  And when that happens, if you wish to use this paradigm, |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=524) |  the source and the products of the source, |
    | [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=531) |  the source is the activity of zero that polarizes and neutralizes. |
    | [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=536) |  The products of the source are the moment-by-moment self and world |
    | [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=540) |  as it arises in sensory experience. |
    | [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=543) |  I don't know what the self and the world are in any other sense, |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=547) |  but feel-image-talk, subjective-system, and touch-sight-sound-objective, |
    | [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=554) |  they are arising moment-by-moment in between expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=561) |  Therefore, they are not fundamentally separate from the source. |
    | [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=566) |  The products of the source and the source are not fundamentally separate. |
    | [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=571) |  So, as you're going around having ordinary sensory experiences, |
    | [00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=579) |  there is this sense that there's not a two-ness |
    | [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlglNS_rg5g&t=590) |  between the source of creation and creation. |
