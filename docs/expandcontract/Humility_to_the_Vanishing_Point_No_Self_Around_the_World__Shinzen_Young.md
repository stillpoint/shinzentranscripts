    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=0) |  Yesterday I wrote out the, it just occurred to me to write the term for no-self in the Islamic |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=17) |  tradition of Sufism which is Fana. Then it occurred to me it might be interesting to write, |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=24) |  to look at all the words that are used by the meditating mystics around the world for their |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=34) |  version of what humility is. So here we go. So we'll start where we started last night. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=60) |  So this is Arabic. It's pronounced Fana, F-A-N-A. And that's the technical term in the Sufi tradition |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=80) |  for what in the Buddhist tradition is called no-self. So let's juxtapose with that Hebrew. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=92) |  It's also written from right to left. So this says Bitul Hayesh in Hebrew language. That would be |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=121) |  romanized B-I-T-U-L-H-A-Y-E-S-H. Bitul means annihilation so very similar to Fana. And Ha |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=135) |  means thee and yesh is somethingness. Somethingness of self, somethingness of world, |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=141) |  or existence. Yesh is the common Hebrew word for exist. So the annihilation of the somethingness |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=149) |  of self and world pretty much sums it up. By the way, after Bitul Hayesh comes Bria, |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=161) |  that you once you annihilate the somethingness, then you become the doingness. So you are able |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=169) |  to participate in the flip side of the annihilation, which is the moment by moment continuous arising |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=183) |  of yesh, things, from I am the divine nothing. And Fana in the Sufi tradition has exactly the same |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=193) |  thing. After Fana is something called Baka, which is now you're stabilized with the source and you |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=203) |  can understand how the world is coming from God, Allah, and so forth. So very parallel type |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=212) |  situations. So that's Islam, Judaism. Now let's look at Christianity. Now early Christianity, the |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=223) |  mystical writings were in Greek. They're called the Greek fathers. They lived in the deserts of |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=230) |  Palestine, Egypt, and so forth. And there's some amazing writings from that patristic period. So |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=241) |  what is the oldest of the Christian terms for the no self experience? Wait a minute. I think that's |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=255) |  an omega. Sorry, I think I misspelled it. Not an omicron, but I could be wrong. I should really |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=266) |  check these things out before I present them to the world. Kenosis. If we were to Romanize it, |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=279) |  K-E-N-O-S-I-S. And osis doesn't mean a disease, by the way. It means a process. And kenos in Greek |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=291) |  means empty. Interestingly, directly cognate to the Sanskrit word shunya. Because the k sound, |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=302) |  the veller stop, the voiceless veller stop of the k sound in Proto-Indo-European became a sha, |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=314) |  which is a palatalized s in Sanskrit. So actually Sanskrit is modified from the early |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=322) |  Proto-Indo-European. Greek still preserves the k sound. So kenos in Greek is a direct |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=333) |  Indo-European cognate of shunya in Sanskrit. And interesting, similar spiritual interpretation. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=345) |  Kenosis is the process of emptying out, emptying out of somethingness that the Christian meditators |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=354) |  sought. And if you could achieve a deep enough kenosis, then you would be able to experience |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=366) |  theosis, which means godding, literally. See, Greek is a very subtle language. There's two words in |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=378) |  God, two words in Greek, theosis and apotheosis. Apotheosis is deification in the sense that the |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=388) |  ancient Roman emperors claimed to be gods. But theosis is deification in the sense that the |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=397) |  Christian who empties themselves out takes on divine attributes, not infinite power and that |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=406) |  kind of thing, but the goodness, the compassion, and so forth. So you become more godlike in that |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=413) |  sense. And culminating in, talk about a subtle use of language and an interesting word, the |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=424) |  culmination of kenosis, according to the Greek desert fathers, is to become isochristos. ISO, |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=435) |  you know what that means in Greek? It means equivalent. Isochristos is Christ equivalent. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=441) |  Now I like to very irreverently translate that into modern English as you experience what it's |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=452) |  like to be nano Christ, a very, very, very miniature version of dying in order to be of |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=461) |  service to others. Your own personal version as opposed to the cosmic version, which is like |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=468) |  that would be the mega Christ. Okay, so kenosis. So now we've got Islam, Judaism, Christianity, |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=481) |  the Western religions. Let's go to Buddhism. So just to put it in an Indic script for the fun of |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=496) |  it. This is Devanagari, which is the North Indian alphabet used to write Sanskrit, Hindi, and such. |
    | [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=508) |  But I just wrote a Pali word in it. Anatta, A-N-A-T-T-A. And this is the famous doctrine |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=524) |  of the Buddha, no self as thing. That gets translated into various Asian languages. Let's |
    | [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=535) |  start with Tibetan. Screwed that up. Let's redo it. Not pretty. |
    | [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=565) |  In Tibetan, it's called Takme or Tame. If you romanize it, B-D-A-G dot M-E-D and another dot. |
    | [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=589) |  But it's pronounced Takme. And it literally means self and M-E-D means without or not. So that just |
    | [00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=598) |  directly translates. In East Asia, you've got Chinese characters as the classical language. |
    | [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=614) |  So that's how you write it. And it exactly corresponds. Now, there's four cultures that |
    | [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=628) |  constitute the sphere of the influence of Chinese characters. Traditionally, those four cultures are, |
    | [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=639) |  of course, China itself, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. So there's local pronunciations for this. |
    | [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=649) |  Let's go down the list. In Mandarin Chinese, it would be pronounced Wu-Wa. Wu means not |
    | [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=666) |  existent or does not exist and Wa is self. So that's exactly like Takme in Tibetan. |
    | [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=675) |  In Vietnamese pronunciation, same characters are pronounced Vo-Nga. Vietnamese has a very |
    | [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=695) |  peculiar creaky tone unique to it. Vo-Nga. You can hear the tones, right? Vietnamese and Chinese |
    | [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=703) |  are both tonal languages. So in Mandarin Chinese, it's a rising tone and then a dipping tone. |
    | [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=709) |  Wu-Wa. And in Vietnamese, you can hear similar, Vo-Nga. Well, let's write it in Korean script. |
    | [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=722) |  Koreans have their own alphabet. I could be wrong about this. My Korean is very rusty, |
    | [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=731) |  but I'm pretty, I think it's Mu-Ah. M-U-A. But I know for sure what it is in Japanese. |
    | [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=739) |  Similar sounding. Japanese also have their own syllabary. Kana. Mu-Ga. M-U-G-A. |
    | [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=747) |  The Taoist also had a term for the nothingness of the liberated person. It's another Chinese |
    | [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=762) |  word meaning emptiness, actually. This character here, which is pronounced Xu. And that's sort of |
    | [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=771) |  the Taoist equivalent. So there we have sort of the world of the humility to the vanishing point |
    | [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwmj37W-NR8&t=788) |  as cultivated in the Western and Eastern traditions. |

If we were to Romanize it, K-E-N-O-S-I-S. And osis doesn't mean a disease, by the way. It means a process. And kenos in Greek means empty. Interestingly, directly cognate to the Sanskrit word shunya. Because the k sound, the veller stop, the voiceless veller stop of the k sound in Proto-Indo-European became a sha, which is a palatalized s in Sanskrit.
