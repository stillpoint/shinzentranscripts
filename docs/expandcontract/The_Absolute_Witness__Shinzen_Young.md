    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=0) |  People often ask me about, quote, the witness and about non-dual awareness. One of the difficulties |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=17) |  in answering questions on these topics is that there's quite a bit of ambiguity as to |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=24) |  what the words, the witness or the phrase non-dual awareness should refer to. In other |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=33) |  words, these words and phrases are used differently by different people. And so to give a sort |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=41) |  of single answer to questions regarding these without taking into account the fact that |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=48) |  the terms may mean different things to different people is the road to disaster, actually, |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=57) |  gross misunderstanding and possibly even contentious malaise. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=64) |  So, one can use the word witness, I think, in two senses. One is the sense that there |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=76) |  is a thing over here that's sort of observing the its over there and in some way detached |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=86) |  from the its that are being observed. So there's one sense of witness. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=94) |  In that sense, the word witness is a very different word. It's a different word for |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=101) |  something that's being observed. So there's one sense of witness. In that sense, witness |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=108) |  is just a way of describing a certain level of equanimity. And from that perspective, |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=119) |  yeah, that's a good thing to have that sense of I'm just witnessing. Stuff is, you know, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=126) |  there's the phenomena are coming and going and they can't get to me because I'm back |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=133) |  here. I call that a distance-creating metaphor for equanimity. I should point out it's |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=140) |  not the only metaphor for equanimity. You can also have a distance-collapsing metaphor, |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=145) |  which is I'm so totally with the phenomena that it can't get to me because I'm like |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=152) |  glued to it. But in any event, if we want to use the word witness in the sense of a |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=160) |  metaphor for equanimity, that's fine. That is not at all, however, at the same level |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=171) |  as witness in the sense of the absolute witness. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=178) |  When you have a sense that there's a sort of observer, a thing that's observing or a |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=189) |  person that's observing, but sort of separate and detached, that's good because it's equanimity, |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=197) |  but it's also important to realize that that's being produced by subtle feel-image talk. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=204) |  I wouldn't say that that's the absolute witness or pure consciousness, but it's a good thing. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=212) |  It's a stage that people go through. However, it's of the utmost importance that a person |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=218) |  not get stuck in that stage and think, oh, well, this is the ultimate goal of things. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=225) |  Then what is the true witness? In my way of thinking, the true witness is contentless |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=238) |  consciousness, that in my system you directly eyeball for just a brief second every time |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=245) |  you observe a phenomenon disappearing. In other words, whenever any phenomenon disappears, |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=256) |  what is actually happening is that the two forces that are molding that phenomenon, you |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=263) |  can call them life and death or affirmation-negation or expansion and contraction or expansion |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=270) |  and contraction or a whole lot of other things, the two forces that have molded that phenomenon |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=280) |  cancel out and there is a cessation, neurota, a collapsing or disappearing of time-space |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=287) |  for, quote, a fraction of a second. That's, of course, a time metaphor, right? By an external |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=294) |  clock for a fraction of a second. There's a little puncture in the time-space continuum. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=303) |  Of course, that little puncture eats up all of time and space. It's the black hole that |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=310) |  sort of eats up the universe and then spits it out again in the next moment of consciousness. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=319) |  My teacher Sasaki Roshi calls that zero. That's what I would call the true witness, but the |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=327) |  true witness doesn't see anything and it's not back here somewhere because there is no |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=333) |  back. It's not in the back. It's in the center. It's not in the center. It's in the center |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=338) |  because there is no back. There is no forward. There is no extension in time and space. It |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=345) |  eats up time and space. It's not inside time and space. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=352) |  When you become the true witness, there's no sense of witnessing anything, any phenomenon. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=359) |  There's no sense of anything. It's contentless consciousness. It's nothing whatsoever. Now, |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=365) |  some people wouldn't call that the witness. Some people would just call that emptiness |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=373) |  or the source or cessation, a nerota, a moment of cessation. If you had to say there's a |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=381) |  witness, in an absolute sense, that's what I would point to. That witness punctures the |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=390) |  time-space continuum thousands and thousands and thousands of times every day for everyone. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=398) |  The only difference between the so-called enlightened people and everybody else is they |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=403) |  notice it and they know that they are that nothing. |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=408) |  If you read in the Yoga Sutras Patanjali, the classic text of Raja Yoga, he begins the |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=415) |  Yoga Sutras by saying, |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=420) |  atah yoganushasanam yogas chittavrtti nirodhah |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=426) |  atadadrashtuh svarupe vasthanam |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=431) |  So, atah yoganushasanam. Okay, this is the science of yoga. Yoga is chittavrtti nirodhah, |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=440) |  the cessation, nirodhah, the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=448) |  Then and only then does the drishti, the true observer, abide in its nature. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=460) |  If we wanted to call that nothingness, that very special nothingness, the true observer, we could. |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=467) |  But that's very different from the sense of there's somebody back here detached watching things. |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=477) |  In order to go from there's somebody back here detached watching things to the experience of cessation, |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=486) |  you have to be able to detect the disappearance of the subtle feel-image-talk |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=494) |  that creates the sense that there's any thing or person extended in time and space or positioned in any location. |
    | [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=508) |  You have to see the disappearance of the subtle feel-image-talk that creates that impression. |
    | [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLxJSpeb8c&t=514) |  And the place where that relative witness disappears to is the place of the absolute witness. |

But in any event, if we want to use the word witness in the sense of a metaphor for equanimity, that's fine. That is not at all, however, at the same level as witness in the sense of the absolute witness. When you have a sense that there's a sort of observer, a thing that's observing or a person that's observing, but sort of separate and detached, that's good because it's equanimity, but it's also important to realize that that's being produced by subtle feel-image talk.
