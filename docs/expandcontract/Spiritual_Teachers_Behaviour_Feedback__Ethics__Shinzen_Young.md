    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=0) |  How can we help? |
    | [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=6) |  One often hears stories of prominent spiritual teachers who have been knocked off their pedestal, |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=16) |  sometimes due to pretty flagrant abuses. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=22) |  I think it is important to realize that there are also plenty of spiritual teachers |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=32) |  who do not participate in abuses, flagrant or otherwise. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=38) |  Also, it's important to realize that even though there may be some flaws in a teacher, |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=50) |  relative to who that person would have been otherwise, |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=55) |  they've made stunning transformation of themselves. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=62) |  In other words, it's important to keep the big picture in mind. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=66) |  There's a Japanese proverb, |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=69) |  hyaku nichi no seppo hei shitotsu. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=73) |  It means you can give perfect sermons for a hundred days, |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=77) |  but all you have to do is fart once, and that's what everyone will remember. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=82) |  So it's important to, I think, keep the big picture in mind. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=87) |  Also remember that most people, in fact the great majority of people, |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=93) |  that practice these techniques are not teachers. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=98) |  You never hear of them. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=101) |  And the great majority of them have made stunning and radical overall improvements in their lives, |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=107) |  although there are still areas of uneven growth. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=113) |  I think we shouldn't have unrealistic expectations about teachers. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=118) |  Well, then how is it that these teachers have this uneven growth, |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=124) |  that they're so strong in certain areas, |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=128) |  but in a sense stunted in other areas? |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=132) |  I think that the main cause of this is some combination of unwillingness |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=142) |  or inability to get feedback from other people on their behavior. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=148) |  So what do I mean by unwillingness or inability? |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=153) |  Well, sometimes things are set up for a teacher in a way that they actually can't get feedback from people |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=162) |  because they're put on a pedestal, |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=166) |  and students automatically assume that if they see some flaw in the teacher, |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=172) |  that it must be a flaw in the student. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=175) |  The tradition sets things up that way. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=179) |  So there aren't actually feedback loops to the teacher. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=183) |  Who's the teacher going to get feedback from? |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=186) |  Well, another more senior teacher, if they're willing to put themselves under |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=191) |  and keep themselves under a more senior teacher, |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=195) |  even when they themselves are relatively senior, |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=198) |  if they're willing to do that, then some feedback structure will be in place. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=203) |  But many people are not willing to do that. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=206) |  After 30 or 40 years of practice, they want to be completely independent. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=211) |  So then who's going to give them feedback? |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=213) |  Well, their world is primarily the world of their students. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=217) |  So they would have to get feedback from their students, |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=223) |  but their students may have a mindset that the teacher is better than they really are |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=232) |  and therefore be afraid or unwilling to give them feedback. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=238) |  Well, then who will give them feedback? |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=240) |  Well, maybe their family will give them feedback. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=243) |  But if their family is not their student or not a meditator, |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=248) |  it's easy for teachers to dismiss the feedback of people |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=252) |  that haven't had a lot of meditative experience. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=255) |  So that's the unwillingness to take feedback. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=258) |  So some combination of inability to get feedback and unwillingness to take feedback, |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=268) |  if you maintain that consistently, you do run the danger of having blind spots in your development. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=276) |  So I think it's of the utmost importance that a person from the get-go |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=282) |  decide that they will listen to feedback from everyone, |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=286) |  whether that person is an adult or a child, |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=289) |  whether they're an advanced meditative practitioner |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=293) |  or are clueless with regards to the spiritual path. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=299) |  A willingness and an ability, meaning that the structures are in place, |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=304) |  the channels are in place, and you're willing to use those channels, |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=309) |  that people will approach you on your stuff. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=313) |  Then you take a consensus. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=315) |  See, one of the problems for teachers is that an awful lot of the time |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=323) |  when students do call you on your stuff, actually it is their stuff. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=329) |  It's the students' stuff, not yours. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=331) |  And that gets to be, that consumes time and energy. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=336) |  And maybe even 80, 90% of the time, it's really them, it's not the teacher. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=342) |  But that 20% or 10% of the time that it is the teacher |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=346) |  and that there's something for them to listen to, |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=349) |  they have to be willing to invest that 80% or 90% of time, |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=355) |  which is a lot of time. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=358) |  In general, teachers, if they're good at teaching, they're overworked. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=363) |  They don't have any play, any extra time and energy. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=369) |  They're just going 24-7 flat out, at least most of the ones that I know |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=374) |  that are good at what they do. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=376) |  It's a lot to listen consistently to what the students have to say |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=382) |  about you as a person when a lot of that data is not of any use to you. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=388) |  But I think it's essential that you be willing to invest that |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=392) |  even though it's a bear. |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=396) |  Because there will be patterns, a consensus will emerge with time |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=403) |  about your blind spots, and that will help assure a more even growth pattern. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=410) |  And in fact, my general approach to ethics is a little different, |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=417) |  maybe radically different from most people's approach to ethics. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=421) |  I suspect that most people's approach to ethics is that there are |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=425) |  certain principles that should be followed, or maybe certain rules |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=430) |  that should be followed, or maybe in the really extreme case, |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=434) |  an elaborate, legalistic, ethical system. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=441) |  But that's not my approach at all. |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=443) |  I actually say that the four basic precepts of Buddhism about |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=448) |  not taking life, not taking what's not given, not speaking falsehoods, |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=452) |  and not doing things in the sexual domain that would be harmful to people, |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=458) |  I say those are some basic guidelines. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=460) |  I certainly have that much in terms of axioms. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=464) |  But beyond that, I think that the main way that one cultivates ethics |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=474) |  is an openness, a general openness to feedback from all other human beings. |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_mppU0j58c&t=481) |  With regards to how you're carrying yourself in the world. |
