    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=39) |  Essentially, it's a combination of, if you're freaking out because of emptiness, see that |

    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=47) |  That's number one. |

    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=56) |  intentionally recreating a new self from the emptiness, a new and positive self. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=64) |  So the combination, if you're, for the advanced student, that frequent question, what do I |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=70) |  do about the seeming negative consequences of the void, is number one, well, if you're |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=79) |  having some sort of fear or other kinds of disorientation or freakout as the result of |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=89) |  the void, then see that that reaction is itself void. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=94) |  That combined with, okay, well, emptiness is only half the picture, focus on positive, |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=102) |  intentionally creating a new self out of the emptiness, but intentionally by holding, manifesting, |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=112) |  and radiating positive feel-image-talk as a consistent practice. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=118) |  Those two things, you sort of negate the negative reactions to the void, and then you affirm |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=128) |  a conditioned arising by creating a new self intentionally, a new and better self. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=137) |  Those two are what I suggest for dealing with the so-called pit of emptiness, which is, |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812I4KYLMF8&t=144) |  I think, the most frequent question from advanced students. |

     From advanced students, the most common question is, how do I deal with the pit of emptiness? How do I deal with the dark night of the soul? How do I deal with the seeming loss of my humanity and the loss of my edge and my dynamic motivations that have come about because of experiencing emptiness? And I've talked at length in other segments about how one deals with that. Essentially, it's a combination of, if you're freaking out because of emptiness, see that the freakout is empty. That's number one. And number two, balance the emptiness with practices like focus on positive, where you're intentionally recreating a new self from the emptiness, a new and positive self. So the combination, if you're, for the advanced student, that frequent question, what do I do about the seeming negative consequences of the void, is number one, well, if you're having some sort of fear or other kinds of disorientation or freakout as the result of the void, then see that that reaction is itself void. That combined with, okay, well, emptiness is only half the picture, focus on positive, intentionally creating a new self out of the emptiness, but intentionally by holding, manifesting, and radiating positive feel-image-talk as a consistent practice. Those two things, you sort of negate the negative reactions to the void, and then you affirm a conditioned arising by creating a new self intentionally, a new and better self. Those two are what I suggest for dealing with the so-called pit of emptiness, which is, I think, the most frequent question from advanced students.
