    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=0) |  How does a person's growth on the path of liberation differ from that of a person's |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=7) |  liberation? |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=8) |  Not true for everyone, but often a person's growth on the path of liberation will follow |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=15) |  what is colloquially called a hockey stick curve. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=19) |  The proper name for this is an exponential curve, and exponential curves have the characteristic |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=27) |  that the more you grow, the faster you grow. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=33) |  Snowball is an example of an exponential curve. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=35) |  The growth rate of the snowball is proportional to the surface area of the snowball. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=41) |  So the bigger the snowball gets, the faster the snowball adds snow. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=46) |  So the rate of growth is proportional to how much it has grown. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=53) |  And if you have any background in calculus or analysis, you know the math behind this. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=60) |  It's quite fundamental actually in those fields. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=63) |  So in any event, when you start your practice, if you follow this common pattern, you do |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=74) |  grow. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=75) |  But it seems like you're growing linear, and there's growth there, but it's not stunning. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=85) |  It's sort of like, well, at this rate, it's going to really, really take a long time to |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=91) |  get anywhere. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=93) |  But hopefully you persevere, and at some point, you start to notice it's really taking off. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=105) |  And some people call this the break point in the curve. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=112) |  As I say, it is by no means the case that everyone that follows a spiritual path goes |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=119) |  through this kind of situation. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=124) |  But an awful lot of people do. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=126) |  Now of course, the natural question is, at what point does this dramatic upsurge take |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=135) |  place? |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=136) |  And we can't say exactly. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=138) |  For some people, it happens fairly early on in their practice. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=142) |  For other people, it might take, in the most extreme case, maybe 10 or 15 years. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=149) |  What happens at this point that makes the difference? |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=155) |  Well, there can be a lot of factors. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=160) |  But one of them is certainly when one reaches the point where one starts to get what I call |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=168) |  the flavor of purification. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=172) |  In other words, you start to actually detect, have a tangible experience that when you bring |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=182) |  mindful awareness to an unpleasant experience, you're purifying consciousness. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=188) |  You can actually taste the purification happening within you. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=193) |  It's really hard to put into words, but it's a kind of knowing that because of the way |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=199) |  I'm experiencing this moment, every moment of my future is going to have more fulfillment |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=207) |  and less suffering. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=210) |  Another way to put it is, it's a tangible awareness that because of the way I'm experiencing |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=215) |  this moment, I'm clearing up the stored poison and pain from all my previous moments. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=225) |  You actually sense that happening. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=228) |  Once that taste is there, you've got a positive feedback loop going. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=233) |  And what characterizes hockey stick growth is it's a positive feedback loop. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=239) |  In other words, the bigger it gets, the faster it grows. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=243) |  So once there's the positive feedback that bringing equanimity, concentration, clarity, |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=249) |  but especially equanimity to a present experience, that you can actually taste it building a |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=256) |  better future for you and cleaning out the past for you. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=261) |  Once that happens, now you've got a positive feedback loop, and that's one of the causes |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=270) |  of this dramatic runaway growth. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=276) |  There can be other causes also. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=278) |  So I give people this hockey stick metaphor by way of encouragement when they're in this |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=286) |  seeming linear phase here, and it just doesn't seem like anything. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=293) |  It seems like, yeah, growth is happening, but if the journey is a million miles and |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=299) |  in the first year I go 10 miles, that doesn't bode well. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=306) |  But what people don't realize is that, well, maybe in the next year you'll go 100, in the |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=311) |  next year you'll go 1,000, et cetera, et cetera. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=314) |  And at some point it becomes evident to you, you reach this sort of, oh my God, place right |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=322) |  about here where you realize that little old me can feasibly hope to experience the classic |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRA9QHVzVg&t=333) |  results that I've read about in these ancient books. |

     How does a person's growth on the path of liberation differ from that of a person's liberation? Not true for everyone, but often a person's growth on the path of liberation will follow what is colloquially called a hockey stick curve.
