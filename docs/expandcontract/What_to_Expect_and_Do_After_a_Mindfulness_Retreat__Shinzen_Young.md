    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=0) |  Upon leaving the retreat, some things that are good to keep in mind. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=18) |  Exactly one of four things will occur in the days subsequent to this retreat for all of |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=27) |  us. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=29) |  Those of you that have heard this talk before know what those four are. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=34) |  Can you remember? |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=36) |  It's an exhaustive and exclusive classification of the basic effects of a retreat. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=46) |  You will either have afterglow only, or you will have aftershock only, or you will have |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=57) |  both, or you will have neither. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=64) |  What do we mean by afterglow? |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=67) |  Afterglow tends to occur more and more frequently as the months, years, and decades of practice |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=77) |  progress. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=79) |  It tends to be more and more a predictable result of periods of intensive practice, although |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=86) |  not absolutely guaranteed. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=90) |  Afterglow means you're calm and peaceful. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=96) |  You've got all sorts of energy and vitality and cascading insights, maybe even epiphanies. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=106) |  As I always say, people have no difficulty processing afterglow. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=113) |  What is aftershock? |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=115) |  Aftershock is you're incredibly sensitive. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=123) |  Tiny little things rattle your cage. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=129) |  That's a great expression, rattle the cage, if you've ever thought about it. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=134) |  The cages are samskaras, right? |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=137) |  Are the limiting forces deep within us. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=142) |  Things happen in the world, and it rattles that prison of the habit forces. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=153) |  That's okay, because otherwise the bars of that prison will never be broken without them |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=161) |  being rattled within the context of the practice. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=170) |  When it happens during a retreat, it's called yogi mind. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=176) |  Yogi in the Buddhist context means us, meditators, yogis. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=184) |  That's like hypersensitivity and things just causing ballistic reactions and so forth. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=194) |  That's a natural part of this path, a part of the deep insights and purification. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=203) |  When it happens during a retreat, we call it yogi mind. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=206) |  When it happens after a retreat, I call it, my own word for it is aftershock. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=212) |  You're really sensitive and vulnerable and there's no skin on you to shield you from |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=223) |  the insanity of the 7-11. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=231) |  Also this sense of stuff percolating up from the inside, like there's nothing holding it |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=238) |  down. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=240) |  Your ordinary ordering principle seems to have been blown away. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=246) |  That's the price you pay for deciding that you want to have an extraordinary ordering |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=251) |  principle. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=254) |  We have a way that we were stable. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=260) |  It works, but we can be destabilized. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=262) |  We want to have a deeper kind of stability. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=267) |  We may have to go through a temporary period of instability. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=271) |  Then we go to this new depth. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=277) |  It may seem that you've lost your ordinary ordering principle. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=281) |  Don't worry about it. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=282) |  You're on the path to an extraordinary ordering principle. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=288) |  There can be, because of that, a sense of disorientation and so forth. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=296) |  These are the phenomena of aftershock. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=305) |  I'm not saying you will have aftershock, but some people do. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=311) |  If you do have aftershock, all you have to do is remember two things, why it's happening |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=318) |  and what to do about it. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=321) |  If you remember those two things, you'll be fine. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=324) |  This path is a path of learning a new coping mechanism for human |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=338) |  existence. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=340) |  The normal coping mechanism for human existence could be characterized by the phrase, tighten |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=347) |  up and turn away. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=349) |  The tighten up meaning don't have equanimity and the turn away meaning don't be clear, |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=355) |  don't pay attention to things. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=358) |  If we're learning clarity and equanimity, then we're in a sense learning the opposite |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=367) |  coping mechanism that most people use. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=373) |  Since the two coping mechanisms are in some sense diametrically opposed, we can't avoid |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=381) |  from time to time in our growth process what I call awkward intermediate stages where the |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=388) |  old coping mechanism has been somewhat shed. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=393) |  The mesh of the being is somewhat open, but it's not so fully open that things just pass |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=400) |  through. |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=402) |  It's not closed the way it used to be that relatively shields us, but not really. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=410) |  In that awkward intermediate zone, we get aftershock phenomena. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=415) |  That's why we feel vulnerable, disoriented, sensitive to the big three, anger, fear, sadness |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=429) |  in various forms. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=431) |  Our cage gets rattled and so forth. |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=438) |  There's an old cliche about the only cure for the ills of democracy is yet more democracy. |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=446) |  The only cure for the ills of these temporary side effects of the panacea and powerful radical |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=456) |  medicine called mindfulness is more mindfulness. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=462) |  That's why it's happening. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=464) |  What to do about it? |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=465) |  Recycle the reactions. |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=467) |  The practice caused reactions. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=471) |  The reactions come up in touch, feel, image, talk, typically feel, image, talk, typically |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=476) |  feel. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=479) |  What to do? |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=480) |  Well, you have techniques and you apply the techniques to those reactions. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=488) |  That optimizes the growth process. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=493) |  What if you can't remember that to do that? |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=500) |  Because I sometimes say that there's an inverse relationship between activation of feel space |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=510) |  and IQ. |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=512) |  Have you noticed? |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=516) |  This is something that we humans, this is one of the great humility pieces of being |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=523) |  human. |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=526) |  At least it has been for me to acknowledge that as feel space gets activated, particularly |
    | [00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=536) |  with negative feel, my intelligence drops. |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=544) |  Therein we have what is probably the fundamental engineering flaw in our species, which is |
    | [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=554) |  that the feel is actually meant to motivate and direct rapid response to situations. |
    | [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=569) |  But unfortunately, it can also drive and distort. |
    | [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=577) |  A situation comes up, it activates feel, and we need to act, but our intelligence is diminished. |
    | [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=589) |  But still we are convinced we have to do something, and therefore what we do is sometimes less |
    | [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=596) |  than optimal. |
    | [00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=597) |  How do you know that? |
    | [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=599) |  Because five minutes later or five days later or five years later, you look back and say, |
    | [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=604) |  why did I do that? |
    | [00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=611) |  During times in my life when I've had a lot of emotional stresses, and this phenomenon |
    | [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=620) |  has been on the surface day after day after day, which is bad, but also good because you |
    | [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=628) |  can get to know it because it's like, hey, it ain't going away. |
    | [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=634) |  So you learn things. |
    | [00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=636) |  One of the things I noticed was, oh yeah, I can see as the feel activates my ability |
    | [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=643) |  to organize words, to respond coherently, to think coherently. |
    | [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=651) |  I can see it just goes down. |
    | [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=654) |  When I realize that, it's like, OK, I'm like room temperature IQ now, and I'm trying to |
    | [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=664) |  respond to this complex situation. |
    | [00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=669) |  I realized, oh, I shouldn't be doing this. |
    | [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=672) |  I just have to walk away and just meditate until I get a little smarter again. |
    | [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=683) |  So in any event, you'd be amazed that you may not be able to remember what I just said |
    | [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=691) |  when the doo-doo hits the fan. |
    | [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=694) |  Then you're going to need to remember something simpler than this formulation. |
    | [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=701) |  That thing you need to remember is the location of my telephone number or someone like me |
    | [00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=708) |  who can remind you of what you already know and then take you through step by step. |
    | [00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=717) |  When I get calls from people, so here's how it works. |
    | [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=720) |  I think you all know this, but let me just repeat it. |
    | [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=724) |  So I turn off my phone when I close the Dharma store for the day, whenever that is. |
    | [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=731) |  That makes it easy because there's people literally all over the world that may want |
    | [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=736) |  to call me, and the rule is simple. |
    | [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=740) |  Call. |
    | [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=742) |  If the phone rings, the Dharma store is open. |
    | [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=745) |  I don't care if it's 3 in the morning, Eastern time where I live, and you'll get me. |
    | [00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=752) |  If the Dharma store is closed, you'll get the voicemail, and if I'm away on retreat, |
    | [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=758) |  that's the bad news. |
    | [00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=760) |  It may be a while before I can get back to you. |
    | [00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=765) |  I try, you know, I've been answering calls during this retreat, but I can't necessarily |
    | [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=775) |  get back immediately. |
    | [00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=780) |  You don't have to call me when it's a crisis, though. |
    | [00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=784) |  You can call for tune-ups or what have you. |
    | [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=788) |  When people call and it is a crisis, I'm happy and sad. |
    | [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=793) |  I'm sad that the person's in a crisis. |
    | [00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=796) |  I'm happy because I know there's a, based on years, decades actually of experience, |
    | [00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=803) |  that there's a very high probability that person, after we've worked together for an |
    | [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=810) |  hour or two hours or whatever it is, will experience what I call MMM, maximum meditation |
    | [00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=818) |  mileage, out of whatever they're going through. |
    | [00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=822) |  So that's how that works. |
    | [00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=826) |  So now you know about afterglow, aftershock. |
    | [00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=833) |  Both could happen at the same time. |
    | [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=835) |  You can have the afterglow stuff and the aftershock stuff, or you might not get any of these effects. |
    | [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=843) |  Now the tendency is to think, if you don't get afterglow or aftershock, then, oh, well, |
    | [00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=851) |  you know, it wasn't a productive retreat, but that's not at all true. |
    | [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=860) |  The gold standard for when people want me to evaluate, is their practice working? |
    | [00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=869) |  I never ask them about their subjective experiences while they're doing formal practice. |
    | [00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=880) |  I only ask one question, and look you around the room, and I know I've asked this question |
    | [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=883) |  for about a half the people in this room. |
    | [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=886) |  Touch base with your practice. |
    | [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=888) |  It's only one question that I ask first, which is, does it seem that you're more fulfilled |
    | [00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=898) |  and suffering less, and your behaviors are improving in the real world, in daily life? |
    | [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=905) |  If the answer is yes, then the practice is on track. |
    | [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=911) |  So it doesn't have anything to do with, did you have aftershock, did you have afterglow, |
    | [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=915) |  did you have flow, did you have this, did you have that? |
    | [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=919) |  It's like, okay, what's the impact in daily life? |
    | [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=925) |  So now you know the four things that could happen, and why they're happening, and what |
    | [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=933) |  to do about them. |
    | [00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=935) |  Five things you need to be successful with this practice. |
    | [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=940) |  Keep them in mind upon leaving the retreat. |
    | [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=943) |  You need to do a little bit of self-practice most days. |
    | [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=947) |  I have a ludicrously small minimum, ten minutes, but that's ten minutes of real formal practice, |
    | [00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=955) |  not ten minutes of bubble bath meditation, or meditation while you're doing tai chi chuan. |
    | [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=962) |  Not that there's anything wrong with tai chi chuan, or whatever, but I'm talking about |
    | [00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=966) |  sitting practice. |
    | [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=968) |  If you only do ten minutes, then do it with spoken labels. |
    | [00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=972) |  So if you don't have quantity, you've got to guarantee quality. |
    | [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=977) |  So a little bit of self-practice each day, that's one thing. |
    | [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=984) |  A lot of practice every once in a while, typically that's in a group, it's called a retreat, |
    | [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=991) |  although you can do self-retreats. |
    | [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=994) |  You can just go off by yourself and meditate, but the point is it's like a jam session, |
    | [00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=999) |  as opposed to daily practice. |
    | [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1000) |  You're doing a lot of practice all at once. |
    | [00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1003) |  That's what we came here, and we have achieved that. |
    | [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1007) |  Little bit each day, a lot every once in a while. |
    | [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1014) |  You have to make an attempt to bring it into daily life, try to pepper the day with, I |
    | [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1023) |  call it practice in life, you know, thirty seconds here, a minute there, while you're |
    | [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1029) |  walking to the washroom, while you're waiting in line, go to some technique of your choice, |
    | [00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1037) |  so that you're not going unconscious, unbroken all day. |
    | [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1045) |  Every day there's little, at least surgical strikes in the thrust of life. |
    | [00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1052) |  You've heard me say over and over again that it is pivotal that you develop the ability |
    | [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1060) |  to start on a die. |
    | [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1064) |  All rest, sight, sight, all rest, sound, touch, or if I wanted to go in, feel, feel, all rest, |
    | [00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1086) |  image. |
    | [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1089) |  Ready to go anytime, just at the drop of that. |
    | [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1093) |  As I said in the group process, why? |
    | [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1096) |  Because when stuff comes up in daily life, you've got a magic window of opportunity of |
    | [00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1102) |  about two to three seconds to establish mindful awareness. |
    | [00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1111) |  After that, the terrorists are in the cockpit. |
    | [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1115) |  They're running the show, and they could well crash your karma. |
    | [00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1127) |  So there's just that little window, and you have to train yourself to instantly be on |
    | [00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1133) |  it with some technique in day-to-day life. |
    | [00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1139) |  Otherwise it goes from sensory experience into objective behavior. |
    | [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1145) |  If the objective behavior is driven and distorted, that's called making karma. |
    | [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1150) |  Law of karma, what goes around comes around, meaning that there'll be a lot more uncomfortable |
    | [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1156) |  feel-image-talk in the end than just that moment of feel-image-talk that you failed |
    | [00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1164) |  to be complete with. |
    | [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1166) |  So it multiplies. |
    | [00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1168) |  So if possible, we want to avoid that happening. |
    | [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1173) |  So a little bit each day, a lot every once in a while. |
    | [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1179) |  Pepper the day with micro hits. |
    | [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1183) |  And have some sort of regular contact with teacher, coach. |
    | [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1188) |  Doesn't have to be just one teacher, and it certainly does not have to be the perfect |
    | [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1192) |  master. |
    | [00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1194) |  Should be somebody competent to guide you. |
    | [00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1199) |  And typically you're guaranteed of that contact with coach or trainer when you come to retreats |
    | [00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1209) |  like this. |
    | [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1211) |  Or if you do the home practice program, which are telephone-based retreats. |
    | [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1217) |  During the self-practice, there's an hour of self-practice in those four hours where |
    | [00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1223) |  you can call whoever is running the retreat. |
    | [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1227) |  That way you can get, theoretically, monthly contact during that retreat situation. |
    | [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1234) |  So some sort of contact with somebody who can monitor the big picture of your practice. |
    | [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1243) |  So that's four, isn't it? |
    | [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1245) |  Little bit each day, a lot every once in a while. |
    | [00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1248) |  Pepper the day with micro hits at least. |
    | [00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1252) |  Every once in a while. |
    | [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1254) |  Certainly, once, certainly, you know, every six months or so, contact with somebody that's |
    | [00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1261) |  watching the big picture of your practice. |
    | [00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1264) |  What's number five? |
    | [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1265) |  Number five is keep that up for the duration. |
    | [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1270) |  We're in it for the long haul. |
    | [00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1273) |  Time is basically our ally. |
    | [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1278) |  So you get results, some quicker, some not so quick, but you just keep it up. |
    | [00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1287) |  So those are the five things you need to be successful on this path. |
    | [00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1294) |  You might say, I don't have much time, that last factor, because I'm old. |
    | [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1298) |  And another factor enters in, which is the aging process is a natural enlightenment process. |
    | [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1309) |  Now the fact that it doesn't turn into that often is not the fault of nature. |
    | [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1318) |  It's the fault of human culture. |
    | [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1321) |  But if you have a practice, then it's much more likely to be that. |
    | [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1326) |  And so it becomes an ally, it sort of takes you to the no self. |
    | [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1332) |  So you've got enough time. |
    | [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1335) |  So let's see, four things that can happen after a retreat, five things you need to be |
    | [00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1340) |  successful with this practice. |
    | [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1342) |  So oh, with regards to the periodic retreats, what I recommend is that when you complete |
    | [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1356) |  any given retreat, you sign up for the next retreat as a habit. |
    | [00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1362) |  You mark it on your calendar in ink. |
    | [00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1365) |  You pay in advance, you put down a deposit. |
    | [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1370) |  You tell everyone you're going to do this retreat. |
    | [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1373) |  It's a fait accompli. |
    | [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1376) |  If every time you complete a retreat, you guarantee, you sign up for the next retreat |
    | [00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1384) |  and it's on the calendar, then each retreat generates its successor and you're guaranteed |
    | [00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1390) |  of a lifetime of retreats. |
    | [00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1393) |  So if you make that habitual, that's very good. |
    | [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1396) |  That's a very good thing to do. |
    | [00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1398) |  I would strongly recommend that. |
    | [00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1403) |  The very first day I, let's see how our time is doing. |
    | [00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1407) |  Okay, got a little bit more. |
    | [00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1409) |  The very first day I talked about what's the big picture. |
    | [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1415) |  The big picture is this path is about transcending the self and the world, seeing beyond the |
    | [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1423) |  self and the world, in a sense dissolving the self and the world as sensory experience |
    | [00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1431) |  on one hand and improving the self and the world, improving our individual lives, improving |
    | [00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1441) |  the situation of humanity. |
    | [00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1446) |  It's about the complementary relationship of those two. |
    | [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1454) |  So as we leave the retreat, it's good to keep that in mind. |
    | [00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1465) |  We've been mostly doing sadhana, work on ourselves for ourselves. |
    | [00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1470) |  Now we're going to go out into the world. |
    | [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1472) |  I just talked about continuing your sadhana, but we move more towards a service position |
    | [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1480) |  as soon as we leave a retreat. |
    | [00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1483) |  Service in what sense? |
    | [00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1484) |  Well, at least in the subtle sense. |
    | [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1486) |  You remember last night I was saying that the positive changes in our affect, which |
    | [00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1494) |  is more positive feel, and the tranquility and energy, which is the restful states and |
    | [00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1507) |  the flow that come about through doing this practice within us, people pick up on that, |
    | [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1516) |  albeit perhaps subliminally. |
    | [00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1519) |  But just walking through the world, you purify the land. |
    | [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1524) |  They say the bodhisattva creates a pure land, land in the sense of environment, the whole |
    | [00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1531) |  environment, including the beings in the environment. |
    | [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1534) |  So you will certainly take the effects of this practice with you. |
    | [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1543) |  And just walking through the world, just interacting with people at the airport or people you pass |
    | [00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1552) |  on the street, that's a service that you're doing automatically and effortlessly. |
    | [00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1560) |  Then there's all the other forms of service, including the explicit service of helping |
    | [00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1572) |  the conditional happiness of people. |
    | [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ifHks5EYZU&t=1576) |  When we go out into the world, we can be doing that. |

     Upon leaving the retreat, some things that are good to keep in mind. Exactly one of four things will occur in the days subsequent to this retreat for all of us. Those of you that have heard this talk before know what those four are. Can you remember? It's an exhaustive and exclusive classification of the basic effects of a retreat. You will either have afterglow only, or you will have aftershock only, or you will have both, or you will have neither. What do we mean by afterglow? Afterglow tends to occur more and more frequently as the months, years, and decades of practice progress. It tends to be more and more a predictable result of periods of intensive practice, although not absolutely guaranteed. Afterglow means you're calm and peaceful. You've got all sorts of energy and vitality and cascading insights, maybe even epiphanies. As I always say, people have no difficulty processing afterglow. What is aftershock? Aftershock is you're incredibly sensitive. Tiny little things rattle your cage. That's a great expression, rattle the cage, if you've ever thought about it. The cages are samskaras, right? Are the limiting forces deep within us. Things happen in the world, and it rattles that prison of the habit forces. That's okay, because otherwise the bars of that prison will never be broken without them being rattled within the context of the practice. When it happens during a retreat, it's called yogi mind. Yogi in the Buddhist context means us, meditators, yogis. That's like hypersensitivity and things just causing ballistic reactions and so forth. That's a natural part of this path, a part of the deep insights and purification. When it happens during a retreat, we call it yogi mind. When it happens after a retreat, I call it, my own word for it is aftershock. You're really sensitive and vulnerable and there's no skin on you to shield you from the insanity of the 7-11. Also this sense of stuff percolating up from the inside, like there's nothing holding it down. Your ordinary ordering principle seems to have been blown away. That's the price you pay for deciding that you want to have an extraordinary ordering principle. We have a way that we were stable. It works, but we can be destabilized. We want to have a deeper kind of stability. We may have to go through a temporary period of instability. Then we go to this new depth. It may seem that you've lost your ordinary ordering principle. Don't worry about it. You're on the path to an extraordinary ordering principle. There can be, because of that, a sense of disorientation and so forth. These are the phenomena of aftershock. I'm not saying you will have aftershock, but some people do. If you do have aftershock, all you have to do is remember two things, why it's happening and what to do about it. If you remember those two things, you'll be fine. This path is a path of learning a new coping mechanism for human existence. The normal coping mechanism for human existence could be characterized by the phrase, tighten up and turn away. The tighten up meaning don't have equanimity and the turn away meaning don't be clear, don't pay attention to things. If we're learning clarity and equanimity, then we're in a sense learning the opposite coping mechanism that most people use. Since the two coping mechanisms are in some sense diametrically opposed, we can't avoid from time to time in our growth process what I call awkward intermediate stages where the old coping mechanism has been somewhat shed. The mesh of the being is somewhat open, but it's not so fully open that things just pass through. It's not closed the way it used to be that relatively shields us, but not really. In that awkward intermediate zone, we get aftershock phenomena. That's why we feel vulnerable, disoriented, sensitive to the big three, anger, fear, sadness in various forms. Our cage gets rattled and so forth. There's an old cliche about the only cure for the ills of democracy is yet more democracy. The only cure for the ills of these temporary side effects of the panacea and powerful radical medicine called mindfulness is more mindfulness. That's why it's happening. What to do about it? Recycle the reactions. The practice caused reactions. The reactions come up in touch, feel, image, talk, typically feel, image, talk, typically feel. What to do? Well, you have techniques and you apply the techniques to those reactions. That optimizes the growth process. What if you can't remember that to do that? Because I sometimes say that there's an inverse relationship between activation of feel space and IQ. Have you noticed? This is something that we humans, this is one of the great humility pieces of being human. At least it has been for me to acknowledge that as feel space gets activated, particularly with negative feel, my intelligence drops. Therein we have what is probably the fundamental engineering flaw in our species, which is that the feel is actually meant to motivate and direct rapid response to situations. But unfortunately, it can also drive and distort. A situation comes up, it activates feel, and we need to act, but our intelligence is diminished. But still we are convinced we have to do something, and therefore what we do is sometimes less than optimal. How do you know that? Because five minutes later or five days later or five years later, you look back and say, why did I do that? During times in my life when I've had a lot of emotional stresses, and this phenomenon has been on the surface day after day after day, which is bad, but also good because you can get to know it because it's like, hey, it ain't going away. So you learn things. One of the things I noticed was, oh yeah, I can see as the feel activates my ability to organize words, to respond coherently, to think coherently. I can see it just goes down. When I realize that, it's like, OK, I'm like room temperature IQ now, and I'm trying to respond to this complex situation. I realized, oh, I shouldn't be doing this. I just have to walk away and just meditate until I get a little smarter again. So in any event, you'd be amazed that you may not be able to remember what I just said when the doo-doo hits the fan. Then you're going to need to remember something simpler than this formulation. That thing you need to remember is the location of my telephone number or someone like me who can remind you of what you already know and then take you through step by step. When I get calls from people, so here's how it works. I think you all know this, but let me just repeat it. So I turn off my phone when I close the Dharma store for the day, whenever that is. That makes it easy because there's people literally all over the world that may want to call me, and the rule is simple. Call. If the phone rings, the Dharma store is open. I don't care if it's 3 in the morning, Eastern time where I live, and you'll get me. If the Dharma store is closed, you'll get the voicemail, and if I'm away on retreat, that's the bad news. It may be a while before I can get back to you. I try, you know, I've been answering calls during this retreat, but I can't necessarily get back immediately. You don't have to call me when it's a crisis, though. You can call for tune-ups or what have you. When people call and it is a crisis, I'm happy and sad. I'm sad that the person's in a crisis. I'm happy because I know there's a, based on years, decades actually of experience, that there's a very high probability that person, after we've worked together for an hour or two hours or whatever it is, will experience what I call MMM, maximum meditation mileage, out of whatever they're going through. So that's how that works. So now you know about afterglow, aftershock. Both could happen at the same time. You can have the afterglow stuff and the aftershock stuff, or you might not get any of these effects. Now the tendency is to think, if you don't get afterglow or aftershock, then, oh, well, you know, it wasn't a productive retreat, but that's not at all true. The gold standard for when people want me to evaluate, is their practice working? I never ask them about their subjective experiences while they're doing formal practice. I only ask one question, and look you around the room, and I know I've asked this question for about a half the people in this room. Touch base with your practice. It's only one question that I ask first, which is, does it seem that you're more fulfilled and suffering less, and your behaviors are improving in the real world, in daily life? If the answer is yes, then the practice is on track. So it doesn't have anything to do with, did you have aftershock, did you have afterglow, did you have flow, did you have this, did you have that? It's like, okay, what's the impact in daily life? So now you know the four things that could happen, and why they're happening, and what to do about them. Five things you need to be successful with this practice. Keep them in mind upon leaving the retreat. You need to do a little bit of self-practice most days. I have a ludicrously small minimum, ten minutes, but that's ten minutes of real formal practice, not ten minutes of bubble bath meditation, or meditation while you're doing tai chi chuan. Not that there's anything wrong with tai chi chuan, or whatever, but I'm talking about sitting practice. If you only do ten minutes, then do it with spoken labels. So if you don't have quantity, you've got to guarantee quality. So a little bit of self-practice each day, that's one thing. A lot of practice every once in a while, typically that's in a group, it's called a retreat, although you can do self-retreats. You can just go off by yourself and meditate, but the point is it's like a jam session, as opposed to daily practice. You're doing a lot of practice all at once. That's what we came here, and we have achieved that. Little bit each day, a lot every once in a while. You have to make an attempt to bring it into daily life, try to pepper the day with, I call it practice in life, you know, thirty seconds here, a minute there, while you're walking to the washroom, while you're waiting in line, go to some technique of your choice, so that you're not going unconscious, unbroken all day. Every day there's little, at least surgical strikes in the thrust of life. You've heard me say over and over again that it is pivotal that you develop the ability to start on a die. All rest, sight, sight, all rest, sound, touch, or if I wanted to go in, feel, feel, all rest, image. Ready to go anytime, just at the drop of that. As I said in the group process, why? Because when stuff comes up in daily life, you've got a magic window of opportunity of about two to three seconds to establish mindful awareness. After that, the terrorists are in the cockpit. They're running the show, and they could well crash your karma. So there's just that little window, and you have to train yourself to instantly be on it with some technique in day-to-day life. Otherwise it goes from sensory experience into objective behavior. If the objective behavior is driven and distorted, that's called making karma. Law of karma, what goes around comes around, meaning that there'll be a lot more uncomfortable feel-image-talk in the end than just that moment of feel-image-talk that you failed to be complete with. So it multiplies. So if possible, we want to avoid that happening. So a little bit each day, a lot every once in a while. Pepper the day with micro hits. And have some sort of regular contact with teacher, coach. Doesn't have to be just one teacher, and it certainly does not have to be the perfect master. Should be somebody competent to guide you. And typically you're guaranteed of that contact with coach or trainer when you come to retreats like this. Or if you do the home practice program, which are telephone-based retreats. During the self-practice, there's an hour of self-practice in those four hours where you can call whoever is running the retreat. That way you can get, theoretically, monthly contact during that retreat situation. So some sort of contact with somebody who can monitor the big picture of your practice. So that's four, isn't it? Little bit each day, a lot every once in a while. Pepper the day with micro hits at least. Every once in a while. Certainly, once, certainly, you know, every six months or so, contact with somebody that's watching the big picture of your practice. What's number five? Number five is keep that up for the duration. We're in it for the long haul. Time is basically our ally. So you get results, some quicker, some not so quick, but you just keep it up. So those are the five things you need to be successful on this path. You might say, I don't have much time, that last factor, because I'm old. And another factor enters in, which is the aging process is a natural enlightenment process. Now the fact that it doesn't turn into that often is not the fault of nature. It's the fault of human culture. But if you have a practice, then it's much more likely to be that. And so it becomes an ally, it sort of takes you to the no self. So you've got enough time. So let's see, four things that can happen after a retreat, five things you need to be successful with this practice. So oh, with regards to the periodic retreats, what I recommend is that when you complete any given retreat, you sign up for the next retreat as a habit. You mark it on your calendar in ink. You pay in advance, you put down a deposit. You tell everyone you're going to do this retreat. It's a fait accompli. If every time you complete a retreat, you guarantee, you sign up for the next retreat and it's on the calendar, then each retreat generates its successor and you're guaranteed of a lifetime of retreats. So if you make that habitual, that's very good. That's a very good thing to do. I would strongly recommend that. The very first day I, let's see how our time is doing. Okay, got a little bit more. The very first day I talked about what's the big picture. The big picture is this path is about transcending the self and the world, seeing beyond the self and the world, in a sense dissolving the self and the world as sensory experience on one hand and improving the self and the world, improving our individual lives, improving the situation of humanity. It's about the complementary relationship of those two. So as we leave the retreat, it's good to keep that in mind. We've been mostly doing sadhana, work on ourselves for ourselves. Now we're going to go out into the world. I just talked about continuing your sadhana, but we move more towards a service position as soon as we leave a retreat. Service in what sense? Well, at least in the subtle sense. You remember last night I was saying that the positive changes in our affect, which is more positive feel, and the tranquility and energy, which is the restful states and the flow that come about through doing this practice within us, people pick up on that, albeit perhaps subliminally. But just walking through the world, you purify the land. They say the bodhisattva creates a pure land, land in the sense of environment, the whole environment, including the beings in the environment. So you will certainly take the effects of this practice with you. And just walking through the world, just interacting with people at the airport or people you pass on the street, that's a service that you're doing automatically and effortlessly. Then there's all the other forms of service, including the explicit service of helping the conditional happiness of people. When we go out into the world, we can be doing that. And then we can help the unconditional happiness of the world, first by that subtle energy that we put out of joy, tranquility, and the flow of nature flowing through us, perceptible to others. And then by describing this practice to people, you can all do that, and some of you by teaching this practice in an explicit way. So on leaving a retreat, it's good to remember that all of us are teachers at at least one of these levels. So we're going out to teach.
