    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=0) |  Let's explore it. |
    | [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=6) |  So once again, take a moment to stretch up and settle in. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=18) |  And now this time, we're going to actively create positive feel, if possible. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=27) |  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=28) |  We'll just see. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=30) |  So I'd like you to think some thought that's likely to produce a pleasant feel in your |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=35) |  body, and then focus in on that. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=41) |  And it will either continue to resonate or it will dampen and die away. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=48) |  If that happens, rethink either the same thought or a different one. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=54) |  And then drop the thought and focus on the pleasant resonance in the body for as long |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=60) |  or as short as it may last. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=62) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=70) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=81) |  Now one thing that can help this is to intentionally smile just a little bit, like the Buddha smile, |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=91) |  a little hint of a smile. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=93) |  Notice how that produces a pleasant feel. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=97) |  And that can fortify the process. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=118) |  Better? |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=195) |  to do that to a certain extent? Excellent. But stay with it for a few more minutes. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=225) |  Laughter counts as positive feeling. Let it spread as broadly as you can. That might go |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=249) |  out of your body. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=279) |  As you do this, try to actually taste how it develops a concentrated state. You're very focused. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=297) |  You're in samadhi. You're in the zone. And your object of focus is this pleasant experience. And |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=306) |  the more concentrated you become, the more pleasant it becomes, motivating you to become even more |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=314) |  one-pointed with this pleasant flavor. That creates a positive feedback loop that revs up your |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=326) |  concentration power. Does that make sense as a concept? Excellent. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=416) |  Now, stay with that concentration in your pleasant emotional body. But open your eyes. Eyes open, |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=434) |  but awareness back into the positive feel. Good. And now we'll make eye contact. Let's see if you |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=444) |  can just keep some awareness during the social interaction. Takes a little bit of practice. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=450) |  So, any final questions or comments? Well, I think this was an excellent session. There's |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=466) |  actually a lot more to say about the technique, but you can read about that at basicmindfulness.org. |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=472) |  Look, there's a reference guide to all the different aspects. I just taught you some parts |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=483) |  of it, but clearly you have enough to implement it, and that's excellent. Thanks for helping out |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41_dSjKGtA&t=493) |  to make this video. Thank you. Okay, that's a wrap. |
