    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=5) |  Rest states flowing is a huge window of opportunity |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=10) |  because you've got the best of both worlds. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=13) |  You've got the restful and the dynamic together. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=16) |  And that is in fact very roughly speaking |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=20) |  the description of enlightenment in the early Buddhist scriptures |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=24) |  as you enter these attenuated, restful, tranquil states of shamatha |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=29) |  and then essentially they flow and go into nirvana. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=34) |  And so they represent an intermediate |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=37) |  between the intensified, solidified world of touch, |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=42) |  touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=44) |  and the absolute rest of nirvana. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=50) |  The in-between is these tranquil states. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=54) |  So if you can have a continuity with tranquil states, |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=59) |  particularly if you can easily access |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=64) |  something restful that's somatic, |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=66) |  something restful that's visual, |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=68) |  and something restful that's auditory. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=70) |  So you've got trimodal rest. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=72) |  And then you get flow in all of those. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=77) |  Now you've thinned out self and world. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=83) |  And now you're melting self and world. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=88) |  And it's not that far a step, just 10, 20, 30 years, |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=93) |  to the vaporization of the self and world. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=97) |  And classical nirvana is yours. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=102) |  Ha ha ha ha ha! |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=108) |  Alternatively, you could get sick and die over the next six months |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOLuaPltorA&t=112) |  and you get in six months. |

     How can we make the world a more peaceful place? Rest states flowing is a huge window of opportunity because you've got the best of both worlds. You've got the restful and the dynamic together. And that is in fact very roughly speaking the description of enlightenment in the early Buddhist scriptures as you enter these attenuated, restful, tranquil states of shamatha and then essentially they flow and go into nirvana. And so they represent an intermediate between the intensified, solidified world of touch, touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, and the absolute rest of nirvana. The in-between is these tranquil states.
