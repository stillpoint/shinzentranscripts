    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=0) |  All the spiritual traditions of the world have a mystical core. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=24) |  In the mystical core of these traditions, there is the final stage, if you want to |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=33) |  talk about stages, which is very dangerous. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=37) |  But the final stage is described as a sense, as you go about ordinary life, that you and |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=49) |  the world are one, and that together, you, the world, and the source of you and the world |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=59) |  are one, or not fundamentally separate. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=63) |  And this is just there in ordinary life. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=67) |  So if you consider prayer, as T.S. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=73) |  Eliot would have defined it as an experience of oneness, d'vakut, d'vakut in Hebrew, then |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=81) |  St. Paul's exhortation to pray without ceasing can be realized. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=91) |  You can pray without ceasing. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=92) |  Literally, every sense experience has now become a prayer. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=97) |  In the yogic tradition, that's called sahaja samadhi, samadhi on the natch. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=105) |  That's what sahaja means, natural. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=110) |  In certain Hindu traditions, it's called non-dual awareness, advaita, meaning not two-ness. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=119) |  There's not a two-ness between the source and the world. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=123) |  As an actual experience, not as a philosophy, as a philosophy, that's a waste of time. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=129) |  As an actual sensory experience, this is a wonderful way to live your life. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=138) |  So sahaja samadhi, non-dual awareness, advaita. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=144) |  If I properly understand Ken Wilber, that's what he's talking about when he's talking |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=148) |  about non-dual awareness. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=149) |  He's talking not about a philosophy or even an experience of enlightenment, but an experience |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=155) |  of moment by moment, self and world as you look here, look there, scratch your nose, |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=164) |  button your shirt. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=168) |  There's not a separation between that and the source. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=172) |  In the Christian tradition, it was sometimes called the practice of the presence of God. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=177) |  Once that has happened, you can't go to church anymore, strictly speaking, logically, because |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=186) |  you can't leave church. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=188) |  So there's no church to go to. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=190) |  You're in church all the time. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=193) |  In the Jewish tradition, it's called bri'ayesh me'ayin, participation in the arising of things |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=205) |  from the divine nothing. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=207) |  In the Sufi tradition, it's called baka, which means this abiding contact. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=217) |  In the Christian tradition, if you read the Cloud of Unknowing, it's a very amazing book, |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=227) |  very short, written by an anonymous Augustinian monk in the 15th century in English. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=236) |  He compares that experience to Aaron, Aharon, who was Aaron in the Old Testament. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=250) |  He was the brother of someone. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=251) |  Moses. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=252) |  Yeah, Moses, Moses' brother. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=254) |  So Moses saw God a couple times, the burning bush kind of thing, but he was up on a mountain |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=261) |  and he wasn't really quite sure what he saw and it was just sporadic. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=266) |  On the other hand, Aaron was in charge of the Ark of the Covenant, the tabernacle, where |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=280) |  the shekhinah, the presence of God, actually resided, according to their belief. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=290) |  So basically, he could look anytime he wanted and experience God directly, anytime. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=297) |  He didn't have to be up on a mountain, didn't have to be a burning bush, didn't have to |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=301) |  have his senses suspended or altered, in any way, it's just anytime you want to pee, here |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=308) |  I am. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=309) |  Tomorrow, we're going to do a sweat lodge. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=313) |  There's a song that's often sung at the beginning of a sweat lodge. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=321) |  Maybe we'll sing it. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=324) |  But it's called the Four Direction Song, but actually it's the Six Direction Song, because |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=332) |  you know there's six sacred directions, right? |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=335) |  North, south, east, west, up and down. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=339) |  Actually seven. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=340) |  The seventh is, those are the expansive directions, the seventh is the center. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=346) |  Contraction. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=347) |  It's all there. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=348) |  It's all there in their ceremonies. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=351) |  The whole paradigm of expansion and contraction, symbolically, completely informs the Native |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=360) |  American ceremonies. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=363) |  It's natural. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=366) |  Anyway, what the song says, it goes through each of the directions. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=383) |  Look to the east. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=385) |  Your grandfather is there, looking back at you. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=391) |  Pray to him, pray to him. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=392) |  He's right over there looking at you, and then it goes, say, east, north, south, west, |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=396) |  up, down. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=397) |  No matter what direction you look, the source is there. |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=402) |  In the way that I was taught, the way you come to that experience is by locally, with |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=410) |  regards to touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, and globally, with regards to the whole |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=414) |  picture at once, developing a sensitivity to this, in the very beginnings, already the |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=423) |  end is there. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=424) |  As soon as the time-space volume of that experience is arising, it's already passing. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=430) |  That molds that moment of sensory experience. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=436) |  Then the expansion and contraction flatlines. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=441) |  Where that flatline is, enfolded the entire richness of all of creation. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=448) |  Hence, nihil par excellentiam, the nothing par excellence of the source. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=455) |  Remember the line from T.S. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=457) |  Eliot, I can only say there we have been. |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=463) |  He didn't say there I have been. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=465) |  He said, I can only say there we have been. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=469) |  I cannot say where. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=471) |  Or for how long. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=473) |  For to do so would be to place it in time. |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=477) |  Time-space. |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=478) |  He weaves time-space together. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=482) |  Like Einstein. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=485) |  Einstein did it mathematically. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=487) |  T.S. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=488) |  Eliot does it poetically. |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=491) |  There we have been. |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=497) |  There is zero. |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=501) |  Absolute time. |
    | [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=504) |  Because we have been there, when past and future come apart again, one looks out and |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=517) |  has a sense of caring for one's larger identity. |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=524) |  Brother or sister, in Greek, a delphos, is from a, which means share. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=533) |  And delphos is womb, the one you have shared the womb with. |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=537) |  If you actually experience sharing the zero womb, then from that comes a sense of wanting |
    | [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=545) |  to serve, be of service to the larger identity. |
    | [00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=550) |  So there is a link in this way between the themes of going beyond the world and the themes |
    | [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=567) |  of improving the world. |
    | [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2anxOUgl1A&t=569) |  There is an intimate link in this way. |

     All the spiritual traditions of the world have a mystical core. In the mystical core of these traditions, there is the final stage, if you want to talk about stages, which is very dangerous. But the final stage is described as a sense, as you go about ordinary life, that you and the world are one, and that together, you, the world, and the source of you and the world are one, or not fundamentally separate. And this is just there in ordinary life. So if you consider prayer, as T.S. Eliot would have defined it as an experience of oneness, d'vakut, d'vakut in Hebrew, then St. Paul's exhortation to pray without ceasing can be realized. You can pray without ceasing. Literally, every sense experience has now become a prayer. In the yogic tradition, that's called sahaja samadhi, samadhi on the natch. That's what sahaja means, natural. In certain Hindu traditions, it's called non-dual awareness, advaita, meaning not two-ness. There's not a two-ness between the source and the world. As an actual experience, not as a philosophy, as a philosophy, that's a waste of time. As an actual sensory experience, this is a wonderful way to live your life. So sahaja samadhi, non-dual awareness, advaita. If I properly understand Ken Wilber, that's what he's talking about when he's talking about non-dual awareness. He's talking not about a philosophy or even an experience of enlightenment, but an experience of moment by moment, self and world as you look here, look there, scratch your nose, button your shirt. There's not a separation between that and the source. In the Christian tradition, it was sometimes called the practice of the presence of God. Once that has happened, you can't go to church anymore, strictly speaking, logically, because you can't leave church. So there's no church to go to. You're in church all the time. In the Jewish tradition, it's called bri'ayesh me'ayin, participation in the arising of things from the divine nothing. In the Sufi tradition, it's called baka, which means this abiding contact. In the Christian tradition, if you read the Cloud of Unknowing, it's a very amazing book, very short, written by an anonymous Augustinian monk in the 15th century in English. He compares that experience to Aaron, Aharon, who was Aaron in the Old Testament. He was the brother of someone. Moses. Yeah, Moses, Moses' brother. So Moses saw God a couple times, the burning bush kind of thing, but he was up on a mountain and he wasn't really quite sure what he saw and it was just sporadic.

Tomorrow, we're going to do a sweat lodge. There's a song that's often sung at the beginning of a sweat lodge. Maybe we'll sing it. But it's called the Four Direction Song, but actually it's the Six Direction Song, because you know there's six sacred directions, right? North, south, east, west, up and down. Actually seven. The seventh is, those are the expansive directions, the seventh is the center. Contraction. It's all there. It's all there in their ceremonies. The whole paradigm of expansion and contraction, symbolically, completely informs the Native American ceremonies. It's natural. Anyway, what the song says, it goes through each of the directions. Look to the east. Your grandfather is there, looking back at you. Pray to him, pray to him. He's right over there looking at you, and then it goes, say, east, north, south, west, up, down. No matter what direction you look, the source is there.
