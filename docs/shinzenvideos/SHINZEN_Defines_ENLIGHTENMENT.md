    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=0) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=7) |  Could you define what you mean by enlightenment in this case? |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=11) |  Stream entry. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=12) |  Stream entry. Could you define that for me please? |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=14) |  Long, long, long piece on the internet, on my YouTube channels. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=20) |  But you would like the executive summary. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=23) |  Please. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=24) |  Executive summary is that you have a kind of, let's see, that you realize that there is no thing inside you called a self. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=41) |  Sometimes that realization happens suddenly and you can read about that in books like Three Pillars of Zen. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=48) |  They've got all these testimonials in there about people for whom it happened really suddenly. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=54) |  But it's my experience that it usually sneaks up on people. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=58) |  Sometimes they don't realize, quite realize how enlightened they've become because they gradually acclimatize. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=64) |  But the Buddhist definition of enlightenment is that you realize that there's never been a thing inside you called a self. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=73) |  Now, there is certainly an activity inside you called a personality. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=79) |  And paradoxically, the more clearly you realize that there's no thing inside you called a self, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=86) |  the more freed up the wave inside you called personality becomes. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=92) |  That would be the executive summary. |

     Yes. Could you define what you mean by enlightenment in this case? Stream entry. Stream entry. Could you define that for me please? Long, long, long piece on the internet, on my YouTube channels. But you would like the executive summary. Please. Executive summary is that you have a kind of, let's see, that you realize that there is no thing inside you called a self. Sometimes that realization happens suddenly and you can read about that in books like Three Pillars of Zen. They've got all these testimonials in there about people for whom it happened really suddenly. But it's my experience that it usually sneaks up on people. Sometimes they don't realize, quite realize how enlightened they've become because they gradually acclimatize. But the Buddhist definition of enlightenment is that you realize that there's never been a thing inside you called a self. Now, there is certainly an activity inside you called a personality. And paradoxically, the more clearly you realize that there's no thing inside you called a self, the more freed up the wave inside you called personality becomes. That would be the executive summary.
