    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=0) |  Another thing that's happening is I'm on to the single most exciting science research |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=14) |  prospect of my career. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=16) |  If my idea is right, well, you'll see it. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=23) |  You will definitely see it. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=27) |  So you want to hear the expansion and contraction on my idea? |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=31) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=32) |  Okay, let's start with expansion. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=34) |  No. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=35) |  Which shall we start with? |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=38) |  Let's start with expansion. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=42) |  So you know, it's a big thing for me, what I call the philosophy of the American philosopher |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=61) |  Harry, I don't know if you've ever followed Harry. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=74) |  Dirty Harry pretty much summed it up for me. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=78) |  He used sexist language, but that was just his character. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=83) |  You have to forgive him for that. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=87) |  One very important philosophical point that comes across from Dirty Harry is a man's got |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=96) |  to know his limitations. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=100) |  So what does that have to do with anything? |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=105) |  Well there is a general tendency for people that have deep and authentic mystical experience |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=114) |  to make broader claims about that than are justified, I think. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=123) |  Don't get me wrong, it's still the best thing ever, ever, ever for our species. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=128) |  But typically people that have these kinds of experiences claim that they have a special |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=138) |  knowledge of the ultimate nature of nature and they have the final answer for everything. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=145) |  I think that that's an irresponsible claim. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=151) |  Irresponsible claims may seem innocuous enough, but they can poison our relationship to the |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=158) |  scientific world. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=163) |  Because in science the one thing you are not allowed to do is make irresponsible claims. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=169) |  You have to have evidence and you have to have logic and it has to be tested and tested |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=178) |  in many locations around the world for decades and decades before it's allowed to be called |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=186) |  a theory. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=189) |  So it's a big deal. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=192) |  Because I am very colored by the philosophy of Dirty Harry, which is the philosophy of |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=199) |  science, I don't like to make irresponsible claims. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=205) |  Why am I going to say that? |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=207) |  Because I'm about to say something that's going to sound like the most egomaniacal, |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=215) |  hideous, delusional claim that you have ever heard me make. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=223) |  But that's going to be the expansive side. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=225) |  Then I'm going to show you the contraction that it's really not what you might think. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=230) |  So I'm on to an idea that objectively, absolutely, incontrovertibly is worth billions of dollars. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=244) |  I've got a billion, multi-billion dollar idea. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=252) |  That is not an exaggerated claim. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=256) |  I'll stand by it. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=259) |  But now you have to hear the contractive side. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=264) |  Whenever anybody says something, the first thing you ought to have to do is, what's your |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=269) |  definition of X? |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=272) |  You've talked about that over and over and over again. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=276) |  By what criterion am I evaluating the monetary value of this idea, is the natural question |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=283) |  to ask. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=285) |  I'm evaluating it by the criterion of the way all science projects are evaluated, what |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=294) |  statisticians call expected value or expectation value. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=304) |  That is the value of success multiplied by the probability of success. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=308) |  Follow what I'm saying? |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=312) |  That's the expected value. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=315) |  It's basic statistics. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=319) |  So what I gave you was not the value of the idea if it's successful. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=327) |  I gave you the expected value. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=330) |  The value of the idea if it's successful is vastly more than a billion dollars. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=338) |  So what does that mean? |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=340) |  Yes. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=341) |  The probability of success is not really big. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=349) |  I give it a thousand to one. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=352) |  Now you might think, well, that's a real letdown. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=360) |  They call it blue sky research or moonshot. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=364) |  It's actually an important aspect of science. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=370) |  Some philosophers of science would say that blue sky research is the single most important |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=375) |  kind of research to do in science. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=381) |  Projects that have a reasonable probability of success with a huge payoff. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=388) |  But one in a thousand is actually a reasonable probability. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=392) |  Every idea I've ever come up with before has been one in a million, one in a billion. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=399) |  Not very likely. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=403) |  This is better. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=404) |  It's one in a thousand. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=407) |  But still it's one in a thousand, so do the math. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=412) |  However the payoff would be trillions and trillions in monetary. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=416) |  It would change the course of human history. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=421) |  You could put a price on it, just figure out what the price of the world is, and then do |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=427) |  some non-trivial percentage of that or some percentage of that. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=432) |  So anyway, I got an idea and I've got scientists who think it's reasonable and I've got people |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=445) |  that are willing to pay for the research. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=451) |  That's really, really cool. |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=454) |  But it's also something I have to devote some time to. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=461) |  So there's that. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=464) |  I've already told you what the idea is actually. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=468) |  It's actually on the YouTube. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=471) |  The last person that interviewed me, I laid it all out if you're interested. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=475) |  I think it was the last interview with the gas— |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=479) |  Buddha at the Gas Pump, remember? |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=484) |  It was that one. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=485) |  I was talking about atheim hormia and the basal ganglia and neuromodulation. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=489) |  That was the last time I heard this Buddha at the Gas Pump. |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=494) |  I'm pretty sure I talked about it at the end. |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=498) |  One of the— |
    | [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=499) |  It was your happy skull. |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=500) |  It was the culminated with. |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=503) |  So it involves my favorite disorder. |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=511) |  I have a favorite disorder. |
    | [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=513) |  It's a rare neurological disorder. |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=519) |  It's horrible, don't get me wrong. |
    | [00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=521) |  When it happens to people it's horrible, horrible, horrible. |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=526) |  But it may have a huge silver lining for research. |
    | [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=532) |  And even for those people, actually, if my hypothesis is correct, you can look it up |
    | [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=538) |  on Wikipedia. |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=539) |  It's called atheim hormia, A-T-H-Y-M-H-O-R-M-I-A. |
    | [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=548) |  You can read a popular article about it in Scientific American Mind 2005. |
    | [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=556) |  The article has the rather intriguing title of The Drowning of Mr. M—or no, no, I'm |
    | [00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=565) |  sorry, Drowning Mr. M. |
    | [00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=566) |  Would you spell it again? |
    | [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=570) |  A-T-H-Y— |
    | [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=571) |  Well, now once again, words and their actual meaning. |
    | [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=576) |  I'm going to tell you the Greek origins, but that's not what the condition means, |
    | [00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=582) |  okay? |
    | [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=583) |  It's just what people called it. |
    | [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=585) |  So what does thymos mean in Greek? |
    | [00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=589) |  T-H-Y-M-O-S. |
    | [00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=590) |  I'll give you a hint. |
    | [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=592) |  Dysthymia, euphymia, alexithymia. |
    | [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=596) |  It's what I call feel. |
    | [00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=600) |  Or it's emotion. |
    | [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=602) |  Okay. |
    | [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=603) |  Thymos is emotion. |
    | [00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=606) |  And what's hormamine mean? |
    | [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=607) |  I'll give you a hint. |
    | [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=608) |  Hormone. |
    | [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=609) |  They stimulate you. |
    | [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=613) |  So it means stimulation or motivation. |
    | [00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=620) |  A is an alpha privative, which means without. |
    | [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=623) |  So if you just look at the words, it seems to refer to a condition where there is no |
    | [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=630) |  emotion or motivation. |
    | [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=633) |  A-thym-hor-mia. |
    | [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=634) |  Ia is a condition. |
    | [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=639) |  Horma is motivation or, yeah, motivation. |
    | [00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=648) |  Thymos is emotion. |
    | [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=650) |  So A is without. |
    | [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=653) |  So the word seems to mean, but does not in its essence actually mean, a condition of |
    | [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=662) |  no emotion and no motivation. |
    | [00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=665) |  Okay? |
    | [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=666) |  A-t-h-y-m-h-o-r-m-i-a. |
    | [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=673) |  Also sometimes called athymhormic syndrome. |
    | [00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=676) |  It's a syndrome, which actually makes it interesting because it can be caused by a |
    | [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=683) |  wide variety of lesions in different locations and of different origins. |
    | [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=693) |  And they can even happen at different times in a person's life. |
    | [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=698) |  But if they happen in just the right place on both sides of just the right circuit in |
    | [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=707) |  the basal ganglia, you develop a caricature, not of stream entry, not of once-returner, |
    | [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=719) |  not of non-returner. |
    | [00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=721) |  You develop a caricature. |
    | [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=724) |  I hope you all hear what caricature means. |
    | [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=727) |  Not the real thing. |
    | [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=729) |  A bizarre something like Arhatsha. |
    | [00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=735) |  Full in-line, full liberation. |
    | [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=737) |  Complete breaking of the identification of the mind-body process. |
    | [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=742) |  Total freedom from desire. |
    | [00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=745) |  And the ability to experience pain of any sort, apparently, without any suffering. |
    | [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=751) |  And the ability to maintain a total mental tranquility indefinitely as a pathological |
    | [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=761) |  state with a well-defined physical origin. |
    | [00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=771) |  So of course, a neuropsych medical professional sees a horrific disorder. |
    | [00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=788) |  I see a caricature of full liberation with a known physical cause, purely biophysical |
    | [00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=801) |  cause. |
    | [00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=802) |  And a biophysical cause that any first-year medical student would immediately see on an |
    | [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=810) |  x-ray. |
    | [00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=811) |  Okay? |
    | [00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=812) |  So it's nothing esoteric in that regard, but the effect on the human being is bizarre. |
    | [00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=825) |  The other name for this condition is much more revealing. |
    | [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=831) |  It's mostly been studied by a handful of doctors in France. |
    | [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=840) |  The French name is PAP, P-A-P. |
    | [00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=844) |  Perte d'auto-activation psychique. |
    | [00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=850) |  Perte is loss. |
    | [00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=853) |  De auto-activation. |
    | [00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=857) |  Of inner auto-activation. |
    | [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=861) |  They cannot boot personhood from the inside. |
    | [00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=866) |  Cannot. |
    | [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=867) |  Now an enlightened person can manifest it or demanifest it as the conditions warrant, |
    | [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=878) |  and the it is inner activation. |
    | [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=883) |  People with this disorder are stuck on no-self, unless you activate them from the outside, |
    | [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=893) |  in which case, in the most ideal perfect case of athymormia, where the lesions are like |
    | [00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=900) |  Goldilocks, not too big, not too small. |
    | [00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=904) |  If they're just the right size and just the right place. |
    | [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=909) |  In the classic case, when you activate that person from the outside by speaking to them, |
    | [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=918) |  they are completely normal. |
    | [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=922) |  But unless you keep activating them, within a minute or two they fall back to a sort of |
    | [00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=933) |  bizarre noble silence. |
    | [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=941) |  This to me is intriguing. |
    | [00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=945) |  It is not subtle. |
    | [00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=948) |  Knowing Mr. M is about someone who first noticed this condition while he was swimming in his |
    | [00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=957) |  backyard. |
    | [00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=958) |  The way he noticed it is that he no longer felt any need to swim or move his body. |
    | [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=970) |  Now it's true, his head was in the water and therefore he was breathing water. |
    | [00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=977) |  He knew that he could turn his head any time he wanted, but breathing water, breathing |
    | [00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=984) |  air, not so different. |
    | [00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=987) |  He's aware that he's sinking to the bottom of the pool and that he's dying, but being |
    | [00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=995) |  alive, being dead, not so different. |
    | [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1000) |  His daughter comes out, sees what's going on, screams and reactivates his normal self-preservation. |
    | [00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1010) |  He flails to the surface and doesn't die. |
    | [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1013) |  Hence the intriguing title of the essay in Scientific American, Drowning Mr. M. |
    | [00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1019) |  It's in your book. |
    | [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1022) |  Maybe I mentioned it briefly. |
    | [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1023) |  Well, I've been looking a lot deeper into it, a lot deeper. |
    | [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1033) |  It's not an easy subject to look into scientifically. |
    | [00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1040) |  Functional neuroanatomy at that level is not well understood. |
    | [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1046) |  But in any event, it's a caricature, but it has some overlap. |
    | [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1065) |  It's nothing mysterious or abstract. |
    | [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1070) |  It's grossly physical. |
    | [00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1076) |  To me, the fact that it's stunningly dramatic and that it has some overlap—I don't know |
    | [00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1085) |  exactly what the relationship is. |
    | [00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1088) |  I mean, it is a disorder, but it overlaps in not just one or two ways. |
    | [00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1094) |  It overlaps in about a half dozen ways with what we're spending our lives trying to |
    | [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1101) |  achieve here. |
    | [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1107) |  So that combination of we know physically exactly what's happening and it has an overlap |
    | [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1114) |  and it can happen within a week or a few minutes, and it has an overlap, many intersections |
    | [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1125) |  with what takes a lifetime to achieve with practice is not the whole picture. |
    | [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1132) |  As soon as I talk about that, people, they think I'm stupid or something. |
    | [00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1138) |  They think I'm equating this with what we want, or they think I think this is the whole |
    | [00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1143) |  picture of what we want. |
    | [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1144) |  I'm not naive, but I am saying that some things really jump out in this as a possible research |
    | [00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1154) |  avenue. |
    | [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1158) |  Not so much to have a physical intervention. |
    | [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1167) |  My paradigm is not so much, oh, we're going to figure out a way to accelerate meditation. |
    | [00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1174) |  I'm much more grandiose than that. |
    | [00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1182) |  My paradigm is we're going to simply make liberation part of standard medicine everywhere |
    | [00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1188) |  in the world. |
    | [00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1195) |  How could that possibly be? |
    | [00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1200) |  Well, what's wrong, what's the difference between athymhormia and being an R-hot? |
    | [00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1211) |  I told you what the similarities are. |
    | [00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1214) |  That R-hot can activate itself. |
    | [00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1217) |  That's certainly one difference. |
    | [00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1219) |  I didn't hear that. |
    | [00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1220) |  An R-hot can activate itself if need be. |
    | [00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1225) |  I can show you the similarities, I can show you the differences, and then I can make some |
    | [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1233) |  conjecture about how we may be able to get the baby and throw away the bathwater, so |
    | [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1243) |  to speak. |
    | [00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1244) |  If that metaphor makes sense. |
    | [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1249) |  The baby being the liberation, the jewel and the lotus. |
    | [00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1254) |  What is different? |
    | [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1255) |  Well, clearly one thing that's different is, see, this is why the condition is so perplexing |
    | [00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1266) |  to doctors, the few doctors that know about it or have researched it. |
    | [00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1270) |  It's very rare, by the way, very rare, because like I say, the lesions have to be in exactly |
    | [00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1278) |  the right spot and exactly the right size. |
    | [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1281) |  If they're not big enough or not in the right locations, then you won't get this dramatic |
    | [00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1289) |  effect. |
    | [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1290) |  If they're too big or in the wrong locations, you get a whole bunch of other effects that |
    | [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1295) |  basically leave that person totally disabled and you can't boot a self by talking to them. |
    | [00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1303) |  They have what's called a kinetic mutism. |
    | [00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1309) |  The thing about atheimhormia is, on the surface it looks like a kinetic mutism. |
    | [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1314) |  A kinetic mutism means you no longer move and you no longer talk, but you're not in |
    | [00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1321) |  a coma, you're not paralyzed, you're not even somnolent, you're not depressed, but you just |
    | [00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1332) |  no longer talk or move ever. |
    | [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1334) |  So you might as well be in a persistent fidget. |
    | [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1339) |  That's the extreme case of a kinetic mutism. |
    | [00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1342) |  That's when you get the lesions, similar lesions, but they're too big and then they just wipe |
    | [00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1347) |  you out. |
    | [00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1349) |  This is expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1351) |  It's just right so that it leaves the possibility that just by speaking they're back to normal |
    | [00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1359) |  without cognitive or behavioral deficit for about a minute. |
    | [00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1368) |  So you have to keep activating them. |
    | [00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1370) |  Of course, if someone were to simply create an app that talked to them all day, presumably |
    | [00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1378) |  they'd be back to normal. |
    | [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1381) |  Let's see, who knows how to design those kinds of apps? |
    | [00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1385) |  I think I do. |
    | [00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1394) |  One difference is you can't manifest self unless you are dependent on another person |
    | [00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1402) |  manifesting, drawing it out of you. |
    | [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1405) |  But in the most ideal case, they're actually just normal for a few minutes. |
    | [00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1415) |  I actually have a student who was a neuropsych evaluator who had this condition in a patient. |
    | [00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1427) |  He's one of my facilitators back east. |
    | [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1432) |  He teaches neuroscience now actually. |
    | [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1435) |  But he wrote up a case study and he confirmed for me just on his anecdote that absolutely |
    | [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1442) |  that's what it was like. |
    | [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1445) |  The guy never complained. |
    | [00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1447) |  He'd been a math prof at one of the New York universities, the patient. |
    | [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1454) |  If you asked him to deliver a lecture on advanced math he could do it just fine if you kept |
    | [00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1461) |  him going. |
    | [00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1463) |  But if you went away he would just sit there and look at you and wouldn't eat and wouldn't |
    | [00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1468) |  move all day, day after day. |
    | [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1472) |  Not subtle, okay? |
    | [00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1475) |  The size of these lesions, rice grain, but bilateral. |
    | [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1486) |  For a few rice grains over the head of the caudate nucleus will do this if it's just |
    | [00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1492) |  in the right place. |
    | [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1495) |  Whoa, that's pretty dramatic. |
    | [00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1497) |  Okay, one difference, it's totally dysfunctional obviously so we don't want that. |
    | [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1506) |  So what makes up an integrated enlightenment? |
    | [00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1511) |  Well concentration, clarity, equanimity, plus wisdom. |
    | [00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1516) |  You have a paradigm about how, you know, about emptiness, suffering, self. |
    | [00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1524) |  You've got a view, a darshan, a dhāwa as the Tibetans say. |
    | [00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1529) |  There's wisdom function. |
    | [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1532) |  And then there's the whole dimension of practice that might be called integration of the void, |
    | [00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1540) |  the degree to which emptiness, your own emptiness, the emptiness of the world is a healthy, empowering, |
    | [00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1550) |  enlivening, fulfilling, and liberating for you versus the degree to which it's not that |
    | [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1559) |  yet. |
    | [00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1561) |  Some people have no difficulty integrating the void. |
    | [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1564) |  Some people have to work at it. |
    | [00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1567) |  Some people have to work a lot harder at it. |
    | [00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1570) |  Every now and again you get the dark night where it's actually sort of catastrophic but |
    | [00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1581) |  still fixable. |
    | [00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1583) |  But that's very labor-intensive and may take a long, long time to fix that. |
    | [00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1588) |  So you have this whole spectrum of a dimension that might be called the degree to which the |
    | [00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1595) |  emptiness or the nothingness of self and world has been integrated. |
    | [00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1601) |  It's functional. |
    | [00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1605) |  It does good things. |
    | [00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1607) |  So concentration power, sensory clarity, equanimity, insight, wisdom, and integration of the void |
    | [00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1621) |  might be one way to talk about dimensions of the practice. |
    | [00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1629) |  So here's my hypothesis. |
    | [00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1633) |  People with this condition have been biophysically, have biophysically induced irreversible perfect |
    | [00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1647) |  equanimity or something like that. |
    | [00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1652) |  Well, that actually could be a good thing. |
    | [00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1657) |  The one characteristic in all cases reported is they don't complain about anything. |
    | [00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1666) |  Now are they actually happy? |
    | [00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1671) |  Okay so doctors know how to do something that they call a mental status exam. |
    | [00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1676) |  If you go on YouTube and learn how to do it, it's interesting. |
    | [00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1680) |  I did just for the fun of it. |
    | [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1686) |  Because they're a professional and it took actually many, many decades to figure out |
    | [00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1692) |  how to teach doctors how to do this, a quick mental status exam. |
    | [00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1696) |  It's very systematic. |
    | [00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1697) |  It's very clever. |
    | [00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1701) |  Like I say, if you're interested, just mental status exam on YouTube and you can get a little |
    | [00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1706) |  tutorial on how to do it. |
    | [00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1708) |  Why do I mention it? |
    | [00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1709) |  Well, I'm a professional and I know how to do something called spiritual status examination. |
    | [00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1716) |  It's just as well thought out and it's just as systematic. |
    | [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1720) |  No one has ever done a spiritual status examination on an athymormia patient. |
    | [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1728) |  I'm going to see if I can pull some strings and make that happen. |
    | [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1735) |  Until then I can make a hypothesis. |
    | [00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1738) |  My hypothesis is they have a physically induced profound equanimity and they probably do not |
    | [00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1753) |  have the taste of concentration or sensory clarity, because that has to be cultivated. |
    | [00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1760) |  And they probably do not have the insight and they probably have not integrated their |
    | [00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1768) |  own nothingness. |
    | [00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1769) |  So they're probably lacking those three elements, four elements, is my guess. |
    | [00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1776) |  So the question is, and I'm not pretending I know the answer to this question, but if |
    | [00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1786) |  the answer happened to be in the affirmative, that could be very, very good. |
    | [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1792) |  But I don't have a clue. |
    | [00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1795) |  But I certainly know what the question is. |
    | [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1798) |  Since these are all dimensions of a single gestalt in healthy practice, will the fact |
    | [00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1808) |  that one of those dimensions seems to be on max all the time, would that make it easier |
    | [00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1818) |  for them to quickly attain the other dimensions with interactive guidance? |
    | [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1825) |  Because remember you can turn them on by interacting. |
    | [00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1830) |  So if they were given a little bit of interactive coaching, could we re-engineer this from a |
    | [00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1839) |  bizarre caricature to something like the real thing? |
    | [00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1847) |  Is there a potential for neuroplasticity in this condition? |
    | [00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1852) |  I have no idea. |
    | [00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1854) |  But I think it's an important question. |
    | [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1856) |  These lesions are static? |
    | [00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1860) |  They're permanent, yeah, if that's what you mean. |
    | [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1866) |  And they happen... |
    | [00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1867) |  Well, they're permanent and they don't change size. |
    | [00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1870) |  That's correct. |
    | [00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1871) |  Well, it's sort of... |
    | [00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1874) |  Let's see. |
    | [00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1876) |  They may change size if they're dependent on tumors. |
    | [00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1881) |  It can be caused by a lot of things. |
    | [00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1883) |  That's what's so amazing. |
    | [00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1884) |  It can be caused by ischemic stroke, what are called lacunar infarctions. |
    | [00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1891) |  But it can be caused by tumors in those locations. |
    | [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1894) |  Those might change size. |
    | [00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1896) |  It can also be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. |
    | [00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1901) |  Apparently the basal ganglia are very vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning. |
    | [00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1908) |  There's even one case where it was caused by a wasp sting, an anaphylactic shock. |
    | [00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1915) |  Happened for whatever reason to hit right in the right place in the basal ganglia. |
    | [00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1921) |  So they can be caused by various things, but essentially, yeah. |
    | [00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1926) |  So let's say we got lucky. |
    | [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1931) |  Let's say that there's a one in ten chance that there's some potential for training here |
    | [00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1944) |  that's significant. |
    | [00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1947) |  That's just a guess. |
    | [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1948) |  It might be one in a hundred. |
    | [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1954) |  So if that were the case, that would be interesting and good for patients, for the few hundred |
    | [00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1965) |  people around the world that has this condition. |
    | [00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1968) |  We put it into an app for them and it would be nice. |
    | [00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1974) |  But then we have to, of course, ask bigger questions. |
    | [00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1977) |  Of course, go big or go home. |
    | [00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1981) |  So let's say we got lucky. |
    | [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1984) |  Let's say it turns out that because they're in perfect equanimity, they can acquire all |
    | [00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1988) |  this other stuff in a few weeks. |
    | [00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1993) |  Now they'd still need an app to keep them like human, okay? |
    | [00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1999) |  But the combination of that app, the app would deliver two things. |
    | [00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2003) |  It would keep them activated and it would train them in what they lack. |
    | [00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2009) |  The paradigm, the integration, the concentration, the clarity skills. |
    | [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2015) |  Let's say we get lucky and this works. |
    | [00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2017) |  Well that's great for a few hundred people that have a rare disorder. |
    | [00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2027) |  And I don't give that even a high probability. |
    | [00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2031) |  That's low probability that this is so. |
    | [00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2035) |  Let's say we got lucky and it turns out it is so. |
    | [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2038) |  What's the next question? |
    | [00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2040) |  What about everyone else in the room? |
    | [00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2047) |  Well now, we could, of course, through various means, high intensity focused ultrasound, |
    | [00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2057) |  for example, we could lesion your brain and then give you the app. |
    | [00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2064) |  That something tells you that this is not going to get FDA approved. |
    | [00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2075) |  Yes, imagine the IRB. |
    | [00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2081) |  We want to take a healthy person and cause a horrific dysfunction that will cause their |
    | [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2089) |  family to have to pay millions and millions of dollars to warehouse them for the rest |
    | [00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2093) |  of their lives. |
    | [00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2094) |  And we would like human subjects approval to do this. |
    | [00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2101) |  Well, maybe in the Third Reich, but certainly not in the civilized world. |
    | [00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2111) |  But let me throw out a very weird sounding word, a very weird sounding phrase that is |
    | [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2119) |  not science fiction, but it actually is science, is done, is known. |
    | [00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2126) |  You can look it up if you want. |
    | [00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2128) |  It's going to sound a little weird, a little oxymoronic. |
    | [00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2137) |  The phrase is virtual lesion. |
    | [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2141) |  Now you say, what the hell is a virtual lesion? |
    | [00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2149) |  A lesion means destruction, damage to tissue. |
    | [00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2157) |  So what's a virtual lesion? |
    | [00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2161) |  Specifically what's a virtual lesion in someone's brain? |
    | [00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2167) |  There are forms of neuromodulation which will temporarily downregulate or even suspend the |
    | [00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2177) |  activity of a certain region in the brain in a way that no harm is done and the normal |
    | [00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2186) |  activity returns in a short period of time. |
    | [00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2191) |  That's a virtual lesion. |
    | [00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2196) |  They're not very controllable at this point in terms of precision, location, and so forth. |
    | [00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2202) |  But it is done. |
    | [00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2204) |  It's done for basic science research and you can get an IRB for that. |
    | [00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2209) |  You can get an Institutional Review Board approval. |
    | [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2212) |  That means a human subject's approval is done all the time. |
    | [00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2216) |  I volunteer. |
    | [00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2218) |  Now I've already decided which cranium is going to be the first one to go under the |
    | [00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2227) |  virtual scalpel. |
    | [00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2230) |  Guess which one? |
    | [00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2232) |  It's a long, long tradition in medicine of doctors researching on themselves. |
    | [00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2239) |  Sometimes the results have been fatal. |
    | [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2241) |  I didn't want you to hear that. |
    | [00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2242) |  Maybe it won't have any effect on you. |
    | [00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2243) |  How will you know? |
    | [00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2244) |  Well, actually, my thing is I probably know better because I can calibrate the dose and |
    | [00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2253) |  the location. |
    | [00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2255) |  Would you lose the ability to calibrate? |
    | [00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2259) |  Not if they're talking me through because you could activate me. |
    | [00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2264) |  Oh, you guys are all freaking out. |
    | [00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2266) |  Remember, the universities where we're planning on doing this will not give approval. |
    | [00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2274) |  Unless it is absolutely safe. |
    | [00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2278) |  I can promise you there's no university in the civilized world that is going to let anyone |
    | [00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2285) |  do anything on anyone where there's a potential for damage that is known. |
    | [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2296) |  No one will allow me to do this unless a very, very tight ass group of people have looked |
    | [00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2308) |  at it and said, this is safe. |
    | [00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2311) |  This is not like you can't just go off and do stuff. |
    | [00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2316) |  You have to get institutional approval. |
    | [00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2319) |  They have structures and they are very, very conservative as to what they let you do. |
    | [00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2326) |  Don't worry, I'm not going to come back like Max Headroom or something. |
    | [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2339) |  The next question is, can we temporarily induce it with virtual lesions? |
    | [00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2347) |  Probably not, unfortunately, because the virtual lesions are hard to control. |
    | [00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2355) |  Remember, we're talking about surgical strikes here. |
    | [00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2358) |  We're talking about cubic millimeter precision. |
    | [00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2363) |  So probably not too bad, but hey, let's give it one in ten. |
    | [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2369) |  Let's be generous. |
    | [00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2371) |  Well, if number one turned out, that's a one in ten shot. |
    | [00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2378) |  And number two turned out, that's a one in ten shot. |
    | [00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2380) |  So now we're talking about a one in a hundred shot. |
    | [00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2386) |  But that would mean that we could take people, put them in this state and accelerate their |
    | [00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2395) |  practice. |
    | [00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2397) |  That would be good for the meditators of the world. |
    | [00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2400) |  But like I say, my ambition is much, much bigger. |
    | [00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2408) |  It's like everyone or it's todo o nada. |
    | [00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2413) |  It's like you do the whole thing, we fix the planet or I'm going home. |
    | [00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2423) |  The next thing you'd have to get very lucky is that the medical establishment realizes |
    | [00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2433) |  that this is an alternate, a better way to do a whole bunch of things that they're currently |
    | [00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2440) |  trying to do. |
    | [00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2442) |  Like treat addiction or manage pain or induce general anesthesia or cure depression. |
    | [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2458) |  For people to be depressed, you have to have negative ideation. |
    | [00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2467) |  There's no such thing as being depressed without intense, incessant negative rumination. |
    | [00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2482) |  People in an athiomorphic state have no rumination at all. |
    | [00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2487) |  They can't ruminate, even if they wanted to. |
    | [00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2491) |  I've got to ask myself, if we had safe, virtual athiomorphia and you took a depressed person |
    | [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2501) |  and suspended their depression completely for an hour or a week and were guiding them |
    | [00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2518) |  in mindfulness practice the whole time, when that intervention is over, would it have any |
    | [00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2525) |  effect? |
    | [00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2526) |  Who knows? |
    | [00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2527) |  But it's not a ridiculous question. |
    | [00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2536) |  Maybe you get lucky. |
    | [00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2537) |  Maybe you've got a cure for depression. |
    | [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2541) |  I'll put a monetary value on that. |
    | [00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2549) |  So we'd have to get lucky, number one, and we probably won't. |
    | [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2554) |  The first lucky is the condition is actually one of enhanced neuroplasticity for acquiring |
    | [00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2563) |  the other factors you need to be liberated. |
    | [00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2568) |  Probably not, but maybe. |
    | [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2572) |  Then we'd have to induce it safely, reliably, controllably, easily, non-invasively. |
    | [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2579) |  Is there a way to do that now? |
    | [00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2585) |  Probably not, but maybe. |
    | [00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2588) |  Then it would have to turn out that doing that turns out to solve a lot of standard |
    | [00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2593) |  medical things. |
    | [00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2596) |  We know for sure that people in an athiomormic condition report pain, even intense pain, |
    | [00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2605) |  without suffering. |
    | [00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2609) |  In other words, they feel it, but they don't experience it as a problem. |
    | [00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2614) |  I mean, I've meditated for a long time, but I cannot breathe water as easily as I breathe |
    | [00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2620) |  air. |
    | [00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2621) |  And this guy did in a minute, just because he had a tumor in just the right place. |
    | [00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2633) |  So is this another way to have analgesia, anesthesia? |
    | [00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2643) |  I don't know, but it's not a ridiculous question. |
    | [00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2651) |  So first we have to get lucky the condition is treatable. |
    | [00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2655) |  When we have to get lucky, we can induce it simply, reliably, safely, non-invasively, |
    | [00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2668) |  controllably. |
    | [00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2670) |  These are all big things. |
    | [00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2672) |  And neuromodulation at this point might be able to do that. |
    | [00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2685) |  So that's get lucky number two. |
    | [00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2687) |  Then get lucky number three, it turns out that when you do this, it's not just a nice |
    | [00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2692) |  thing for people that want to meditate, it speeds up your practice. |
    | [00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2696) |  It has one, but I'm guessing if it has one, it probably has a half dozen, significant |
    | [00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2708) |  applications in standard medicine, both physical medicine and psychiatry, addiction recovery. |
    | [00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2717) |  That's get lucky number three. |
    | [00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2723) |  Now how do you compute the probability of the overall success if it's contingent on, |
    | [00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2734) |  let's say, one in ten chance of A, one in ten chance of B, one in ten chance of C? |
    | [00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2743) |  What's the total probability of success? |
    | [00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2745) |  One in a thousand. |
    | [00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2747) |  One in a thousand. |
    | [00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2748) |  It's a tenth. |
    | [00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2749) |  Are you sure about three being one in ten? |
    | [00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2750) |  Are you sure about your third case being one in ten, or do you guess it's one in ten? |
    | [00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2760) |  My guess is somewhere between one in ten and one in a hundred for each of these. |
    | [00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2768) |  So what does that give us? |
    | [00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2769) |  If it's one in a hundred, that gives us a total probability of one one hundredth times |
    | [00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2780) |  one one hundredth times one one hundredth. |
    | [00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2782) |  What's that? |
    | [00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2783) |  That makes it one hundred. |
    | [00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2785) |  If it's ten, it's one tenth times one tenth times ten. |
    | [00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2790) |  It's one in a thousand. |
    | [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2792) |  So somewhere between a million to one shot and a thousand to one shot I think is reasonable. |
    | [00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2802) |  But the payoff is still going to be in the tens of trillions. |
    | [00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2807) |  So the expected value is just huge. |
    | [00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2810) |  So that's pretty exciting. |
    | [00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2811) |  Question? |
    | [00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2812) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2813) |  Can you explain why number one is necessary? |
    | [00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2823) |  Well if it's not trainable, then it's not a situation that can be used to accelerate |
    | [00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2836) |  spiritual growth. |
    | [00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2840) |  Number one means... |
    | [00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2843) |  If those subjects have possibly a normal brain that has a temporary lesion, a virtual lesion, |
    | [00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2850) |  I am going to... |
    | [00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2851) | ...exclude number two. |
    | [00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2853) |  Yeah, I'm going to guess that because the only thing different about the person with |
    | [00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2861) |  the permanent lesions and the temporary lesions is one is permanent. |
    | [00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2867) |  There's no other difference in the most idealized case of atheanormia. |
    | [00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2874) |  There's a lot of difference that we know of, but there's a few subjects with the condition. |
    | [00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2883) |  It seems to me that it might still be reasonable, even if number one fails, to find a, hopefully |
    | [00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2888) |  not Shenzhen first subject, to step up and have a virtual lesion. |
    | [00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2895) |  I'm guessing since the physical and psychiatric exams on the most idealized atheanormic patient |
    | [00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2904) |  show them as being completely normal, it's most likely that there's nothing else going |
    | [00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2909) |  on there. |
    | [00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2910) |  So that's a nice idea. |
    | [00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2911) |  You didn't have your first sell to the institution that you were also a part of. |
    | [00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2912) |  You didn't have number one success. |
    | [00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2913) |  No, no, actually... |
    | [00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2914) |  Oh, now you're on to something. |
    | [00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2915) |  Okay. |
    | [00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2916) |  Now you're on to what we're actually going to probably do. |
    | [00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2929) |  I don't think I'm going to be able to get access to the atheanormia patients. |
    | [00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2935) |  That's a big deal because it's too rare and I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. |
    | [00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2942) |  So I'm going to make a hypothesis that it's trainable and we're going to go right to the |
    | [00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2948) |  virtual lesion. |
    | [00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2950) |  So you're absolutely correct in that you're totally on the mark with respect to my strategies. |
    | [00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2964) |  We want your brain. |
    | [00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2967) |  So this isn't what I intended to talk about at all. |
    | [00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2972) |  Here we are. |
    | [00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2973) |  Did we get it on camera? |
    | [00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2975) |  It's all on camera. |
    | [00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2976) |  Okay. |
    | [00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2977) |  We've got the record of it. |
    | [00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2978) |  You heard it here first. |
    | [00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2981) |  It's still between one in a thousand and one in a million. |
    | [00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2986) |  But if we get very, very lucky, this is going in the archives, you could all say, I was |
    | [00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2995) |  there when they made that YouTube. |
    | [00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2999) |  The one that has a thousand more views than any YouTube in the history of YouTube because... |
    | [00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3011) |  So that's my thing. |
    | [00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3012) |  Okay, go big or go home. |
    | [00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3015) |  Have you ever got a dark night in a brain scene? |
    | [00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3022) |  No. |
    | [00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3023) |  I don't think someone else has. |
    | [00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3027) |  But what we did capture at Harvard was a physical cessation in one of the participants, a real |
    | [00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3041) |  neuroda where she was gone, gone, gone for a minute or two. |
    | [00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3049) |  We captured that in an MRI scanner. |
    | [00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3053) |  Even though it's been years ago, we still have not gotten around to analyzing that part |
    | [00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3057) |  of the data. |
    | [00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3058) |  It takes forever to analyze this data. |
    | [00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3062) |  But we did capture that, but no, we've never gotten a dark night. |
    | [00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3064) |  Well, I'm sorry. |
    | [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3065) |  I just got carried away. |
    | [00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3067) |  I was just going to explain why I might not be answering your phone call. |
    | [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3075) |  Now I filled in the details so you can maybe have some vicarious whatever... |
    | [00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3084) |  Say what? |
    | [00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3085) |  You'll continue to retreat? |
    | [00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3086) |  Oh yeah, yeah. |
    | [00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3089) |  You won't see that much difference, just maybe a little latency in my response. |
    | [00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3094) |  And now we're getting at equanimity. |
    | [00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3098) |  Because he's off on his mad scientist trip doing what he always wanted to do, which is |
    | [00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3108) |  control people's brains. |
    | [00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3111) |  Okay, well, sorry about that. |
    | [00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3116) |  I got carried away. |
    | [00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3118) |  Is there anything we can do to help? |
    | [00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3123) |  Volunteer your brain? |
    | [00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3124) |  No, deepen your practice. |
    | [00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3129) |  That's what helps. |
    | [00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3131) |  It forms the base in the world to deepen your own practice. |
    | [00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3135) |  Because the more people that go deep, it creates a culture where someday some team of researchers |
    | [00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3148) |  will pull off something like this, if we can last long enough. |
    | [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3153) |  Now, can we last long enough? |
    | [00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3156) |  That's a whole other thing. |
    | [00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3157) |  I'm not going to predict if we're going to make it or not. |
    | [00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3161) |  But if we can somehow just hang on, keep civilization going for another century or so, I would say |
    | [00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3170) |  there's a high probability that some group of people will come up with something like |
    | [00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3178) |  this. |
    | [00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3179) |  And then the world will change rapidly, rapidly for the better. |
    | [00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3186) |  It's the old messianic vision, but not based on mythology, based on logic and evidence. |
    | [00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3195) |  So anyway, so much for that. |

=== "Text"
     Another thing that's happening is I'm on to the single most exciting science research prospect of my career. If my idea is right, well, you'll see it. You will definitely see it. So you want to hear the expansion and contraction on my idea? Yes. Okay, let's start with expansion. No. Which shall we start with? Let's start with expansion. So you know, it's a big thing for me, what I call the philosophy of the American philosopher Harry, I don't know if you've ever followed Harry. Dirty Harry pretty much summed it up for me. He used sexist language, but that was just his character. You have to forgive him for that. One very important philosophical point that comes across from Dirty Harry is a man's got to know his limitations. So what does that have to do with anything? Well there is a general tendency for people that have deep and authentic mystical experience to make broader claims about that than are justified, I think. Don't get me wrong, it's still the best thing ever, ever, ever for our species. But typically people that have these kinds of experiences claim that they have a special knowledge of the ultimate nature of nature and they have the final answer for everything. I think that that's an irresponsible claim. Irresponsible claims may seem innocuous enough, but they can poison our relationship to the scientific world. Because in science the one thing you are not allowed to do is make irresponsible claims. You have to have evidence and you have to have logic and it has to be tested and tested in many locations around the world for decades and decades before it's allowed to be called a theory. So it's a big deal. Because I am very colored by the philosophy of Dirty Harry, which is the philosophy of science, I don't like to make irresponsible claims. Why am I going to say that? Because I'm about to say something that's going to sound like the most egomaniacal, hideous, delusional claim that you have ever heard me make. But that's going to be the expansive side. Then I'm going to show you the contraction that it's really not what you might think. So I'm on to an idea that objectively, absolutely, incontrovertibly is worth billions of dollars. I've got a billion, multi-billion dollar idea. That is not an exaggerated claim. I'll stand by it. But now you have to hear the contractive side. Whenever anybody says something, the first thing you ought to have to do is, what's your definition of X? You've talked about that over and over and over again. By what criterion am I evaluating the monetary value of this idea, is the natural question to ask. I'm evaluating it by the criterion of the way all science projects are evaluated, what statisticians call expected value or expectation value. That is the value of success multiplied by the probability of success. Follow what I'm saying? That's the expected value. It's basic statistics. So what I gave you was not the value of the idea if it's successful. I gave you the expected value. The value of the idea if it's successful is vastly more than a billion dollars. So what does that mean? Yes. The probability of success is not really big. I give it a thousand to one. Now you might think, well, that's a real letdown. They call it blue sky research or moonshot. It's actually an important aspect of science. Some philosophers of science would say that blue sky research is the single most important kind of research to do in science. Projects that have a reasonable probability of success with a huge payoff. But one in a thousand is actually a reasonable probability. Every idea I've ever come up with before has been one in a million, one in a billion. Not very likely. This is better. It's one in a thousand. But still it's one in a thousand, so do the math. However the payoff would be trillions and trillions in monetary. It would change the course of human history. You could put a price on it, just figure out what the price of the world is, and then do some non-trivial percentage of that or some percentage of that. So anyway, I got an idea and I've got scientists who think it's reasonable and I've got people that are willing to pay for the research. That's really, really cool. But it's also something I have to devote some time to. So there's that. I've already told you what the idea is actually. It's actually on the YouTube. The last person that interviewed me, I laid it all out if you're interested. I think it was the last interview with the gas— Buddha at the Gas Pump, remember? It was that one. I was talking about atheim hormia and the basal ganglia and neuromodulation. That was the last time I heard this Buddha at the Gas Pump. I'm pretty sure I talked about it at the end. One of the— It was your happy skull. It was the culminated with. So it involves my favorite disorder. I have a favorite disorder. It's a rare neurological disorder. It's horrible, don't get me wrong. When it happens to people it's horrible, horrible, horrible. But it may have a huge silver lining for research. And even for those people, actually, if my hypothesis is correct, you can look it up on Wikipedia. It's called atheim hormia, A-T-H-Y-M-H-O-R-M-I-A. You can read a popular article about it in Scientific American Mind 2005. The article has the rather intriguing title of The Drowning of Mr. M—or no, no, I'm sorry, Drowning Mr. M. Would you spell it again? A-T-H-Y— Well, now once again, words and their actual meaning. I'm going to tell you the Greek origins, but that's not what the condition means, okay? It's just what people called it. So what does thymos mean in Greek? T-H-Y-M-O-S. I'll give you a hint. Dysthymia, euphymia, alexithymia. It's what I call feel. Or it's emotion. Okay. Thymos is emotion. And what's hormamine mean? I'll give you a hint. Hormone. They stimulate you. So it means stimulation or motivation. A is an alpha privative, which means without. So if you just look at the words, it seems to refer to a condition where there is no emotion or motivation. A-thym-hor-mia. Ia is a condition. Horma is motivation or, yeah, motivation. Thymos is emotion. So A is without. So the word seems to mean, but does not in its essence actually mean, a condition of no emotion and no motivation. Okay? A-t-h-y-m-h-o-r-m-i-a. Also sometimes called athymhormic syndrome. It's a syndrome, which actually makes it interesting because it can be caused by a wide variety of lesions in different locations and of different origins. And they can even happen at different times in a person's life. But if they happen in just the right place on both sides of just the right circuit in the basal ganglia, you develop a caricature, not of stream entry, not of once-returner, not of non-returner. You develop a caricature. I hope you all hear what caricature means. Not the real thing. A bizarre something like Arhatsha. Full in-line, full liberation. Complete breaking of the identification of the mind-body process. Total freedom from desire. And the ability to experience pain of any sort, apparently, without any suffering. And the ability to maintain a total mental tranquility indefinitely as a pathological state with a well-defined physical origin. So of course, a neuropsych medical professional sees a horrific disorder. I see a caricature of full liberation with a known physical cause, purely biophysical cause. And a biophysical cause that any first-year medical student would immediately see on an x-ray. Okay? So it's nothing esoteric in that regard, but the effect on the human being is bizarre. The other name for this condition is much more revealing. It's mostly been studied by a handful of doctors in France. The French name is PAP, P-A-P. Perte d'auto-activation psychique. Perte is loss. De auto-activation. Of inner auto-activation. They cannot boot personhood from the inside. Cannot. Now an enlightened person can manifest it or demanifest it as the conditions warrant, and the it is inner activation. People with this disorder are stuck on no-self, unless you activate them from the outside, in which case, in the most ideal perfect case of athymormia, where the lesions are like Goldilocks, not too big, not too small. If they're just the right size and just the right place. In the classic case, when you activate that person from the outside by speaking to them, they are completely normal. But unless you keep activating them, within a minute or two they fall back to a sort of bizarre noble silence. This to me is intriguing. It is not subtle. Knowing Mr. M is about someone who first noticed this condition while he was swimming in his backyard. The way he noticed it is that he no longer felt any need to swim or move his body. Now it's true, his head was in the water and therefore he was breathing water. He knew that he could turn his head any time he wanted, but breathing water, breathing air, not so different. He's aware that he's sinking to the bottom of the pool and that he's dying, but being alive, being dead, not so different. His daughter comes out, sees what's going on, screams and reactivates his normal self-preservation. He flails to the surface and doesn't die. Hence the intriguing title of the essay in Scientific American, Drowning Mr. M. It's in your book. Maybe I mentioned it briefly. Well, I've been looking a lot deeper into it, a lot deeper. It's not an easy subject to look into scientifically. Functional neuroanatomy at that level is not well understood. But in any event, it's a caricature, but it has some overlap. It's nothing mysterious or abstract. It's grossly physical. To me, the fact that it's stunningly dramatic and that it has some overlap—I don't know exactly what the relationship is. I mean, it is a disorder, but it overlaps in not just one or two ways. It overlaps in about a half dozen ways with what we're spending our lives trying to achieve here. So that combination of we know physically exactly what's happening and it has an overlap and it can happen within a week or a few minutes, and it has an overlap, many intersections with what takes a lifetime to achieve with practice is not the whole picture. As soon as I talk about that, people, they think I'm stupid or something. They think I'm equating this with what we want, or they think I think this is the whole picture of what we want. I'm not naive, but I am saying that some things really jump out in this as a possible research avenue. Not so much to have a physical intervention. My paradigm is not so much, oh, we're going to figure out a way to accelerate meditation. I'm much more grandiose than that. My paradigm is we're going to simply make liberation part of standard medicine everywhere in the world. How could that possibly be? Well, what's wrong, what's the difference between athymhormia and being an R-hot? I told you what the similarities are. That R-hot can activate itself. That's certainly one difference. I didn't hear that. An R-hot can activate itself if need be. I can show you the similarities, I can show you the differences, and then I can make some conjecture about how we may be able to get the baby and throw away the bathwater, so to speak. If that metaphor makes sense. The baby being the liberation, the jewel and the lotus. What is different? Well, clearly one thing that's different is, see, this is why the condition is so perplexing to doctors, the few doctors that know about it or have researched it. It's very rare, by the way, very rare, because like I say, the lesions have to be in exactly the right spot and exactly the right size. If they're not big enough or not in the right locations, then you won't get this dramatic effect. If they're too big or in the wrong locations, you get a whole bunch of other effects that basically leave that person totally disabled and you can't boot a self by talking to them. They have what's called a kinetic mutism. The thing about atheimhormia is, on the surface it looks like a kinetic mutism. A kinetic mutism means you no longer move and you no longer talk, but you're not in a coma, you're not paralyzed, you're not even somnolent, you're not depressed, but you just no longer talk or move ever. So you might as well be in a persistent fidget. That's the extreme case of a kinetic mutism. That's when you get the lesions, similar lesions, but they're too big and then they just wipe you out. This is expansion and contraction. It's just right so that it leaves the possibility that just by speaking they're back to normal without cognitive or behavioral deficit for about a minute. So you have to keep activating them. Of course, if someone were to simply create an app that talked to them all day, presumably they'd be back to normal. Let's see, who knows how to design those kinds of apps? I think I do. One difference is you can't manifest self unless you are dependent on another person manifesting, drawing it out of you. But in the most ideal case, they're actually just normal for a few minutes. I actually have a student who was a neuropsych evaluator who had this condition in a patient. He's one of my facilitators back east. He teaches neuroscience now actually. But he wrote up a case study and he confirmed for me just on his anecdote that absolutely that's what it was like. The guy never complained. He'd been a math prof at one of the New York universities, the patient. If you asked him to deliver a lecture on advanced math he could do it just fine if you kept him going. But if you went away he would just sit there and look at you and wouldn't eat and wouldn't move all day, day after day. Not subtle, okay? The size of these lesions, rice grain, but bilateral. For a few rice grains over the head of the caudate nucleus will do this if it's just in the right place. Whoa, that's pretty dramatic. Okay, one difference, it's totally dysfunctional obviously so we don't want that. So what makes up an integrated enlightenment? Well concentration, clarity, equanimity, plus wisdom. You have a paradigm about how, you know, about emptiness, suffering, self. You've got a view, a darshan, a dhāwa as the Tibetans say. There's wisdom function. And then there's the whole dimension of practice that might be called integration of the void, the degree to which emptiness, your own emptiness, the emptiness of the world is a healthy, empowering, enlivening, fulfilling, and liberating for you versus the degree to which it's not that yet. Some people have no difficulty integrating the void. Some people have to work at it. Some people have to work a lot harder at it. Every now and again you get the dark night where it's actually sort of catastrophic but still fixable. But that's very labor-intensive and may take a long, long time to fix that. So you have this whole spectrum of a dimension that might be called the degree to which the emptiness or the nothingness of self and world has been integrated. It's functional. It does good things. So concentration power, sensory clarity, equanimity, insight, wisdom, and integration of the void might be one way to talk about dimensions of the practice. So here's my hypothesis. People with this condition have been biophysically, have biophysically induced irreversible perfect equanimity or something like that. Well, that actually could be a good thing. The one characteristic in all cases reported is they don't complain about anything. Now are they actually happy? Okay so doctors know how to do something that they call a mental status exam. If you go on YouTube and learn how to do it, it's interesting. I did just for the fun of it. Because they're a professional and it took actually many, many decades to figure out how to teach doctors how to do this, a quick mental status exam. It's very systematic. It's very clever. Like I say, if you're interested, just mental status exam on YouTube and you can get a little tutorial on how to do it. Why do I mention it? Well, I'm a professional and I know how to do something called spiritual status examination. It's just as well thought out and it's just as systematic. No one has ever done a spiritual status examination on an athymormia patient. I'm going to see if I can pull some strings and make that happen. Until then I can make a hypothesis. My hypothesis is they have a physically induced profound equanimity and they probably do not have the taste of concentration or sensory clarity, because that has to be cultivated. And they probably do not have the insight and they probably have not integrated their own nothingness. So they're probably lacking those three elements, four elements, is my guess. So the question is, and I'm not pretending I know the answer to this question, but if the answer happened to be in the affirmative, that could be very, very good. But I don't have a clue. But I certainly know what the question is. Since these are all dimensions of a single gestalt in healthy practice, will the fact that one of those dimensions seems to be on max all the time, would that make it easier for them to quickly attain the other dimensions with interactive guidance? Because remember you can turn them on by interacting. So if they were given a little bit of interactive coaching, could we re-engineer this from a bizarre caricature to something like the real thing? Is there a potential for neuroplasticity in this condition? I have no idea. But I think it's an important question. These lesions are static? They're permanent, yeah, if that's what you mean. And they happen... Well, they're permanent and they don't change size. That's correct. Well, it's sort of... Let's see. They may change size if they're dependent on tumors. It can be caused by a lot of things. That's what's so amazing. It can be caused by ischemic stroke, what are called lacunar infarctions. But it can be caused by tumors in those locations. Those might change size. It can also be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. Apparently the basal ganglia are very vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning. There's even one case where it was caused by a wasp sting, an anaphylactic shock. Happened for whatever reason to hit right in the right place in the basal ganglia. So they can be caused by various things, but essentially, yeah. So let's say we got lucky. Let's say that there's a one in ten chance that there's some potential for training here that's significant. That's just a guess. It might be one in a hundred. So if that were the case, that would be interesting and good for patients, for the few hundred people around the world that has this condition. We put it into an app for them and it would be nice. But then we have to, of course, ask bigger questions. Of course, go big or go home. So let's say we got lucky. Let's say it turns out that because they're in perfect equanimity, they can acquire all this other stuff in a few weeks. Now they'd still need an app to keep them like human, okay? But the combination of that app, the app would deliver two things. It would keep them activated and it would train them in what they lack. The paradigm, the integration, the concentration, the clarity skills. Let's say we get lucky and this works. Well that's great for a few hundred people that have a rare disorder. And I don't give that even a high probability. That's low probability that this is so. Let's say we got lucky and it turns out it is so. What's the next question? What about everyone else in the room? Well now, we could, of course, through various means, high intensity focused ultrasound, for example, we could lesion your brain and then give you the app. That something tells you that this is not going to get FDA approved. Yes, imagine the IRB. We want to take a healthy person and cause a horrific dysfunction that will cause their family to have to pay millions and millions of dollars to warehouse them for the rest of their lives. And we would like human subjects approval to do this. Well, maybe in the Third Reich, but certainly not in the civilized world. But let me throw out a very weird sounding word, a very weird sounding phrase that is not science fiction, but it actually is science, is done, is known. You can look it up if you want. It's going to sound a little weird, a little oxymoronic. The phrase is virtual lesion. Now you say, what the hell is a virtual lesion? A lesion means destruction, damage to tissue. So what's a virtual lesion? Specifically what's a virtual lesion in someone's brain? There are forms of neuromodulation which will temporarily downregulate or even suspend the activity of a certain region in the brain in a way that no harm is done and the normal activity returns in a short period of time. That's a virtual lesion. They're not very controllable at this point in terms of precision, location, and so forth. But it is done. It's done for basic science research and you can get an IRB for that. You can get an Institutional Review Board approval. That means a human subject's approval is done all the time. I volunteer. Now I've already decided which cranium is going to be the first one to go under the virtual scalpel. Guess which one? It's a long, long tradition in medicine of doctors researching on themselves. Sometimes the results have been fatal. I didn't want you to hear that. Maybe it won't have any effect on you. How will you know? Well, actually, my thing is I probably know better because I can calibrate the dose and the location. Would you lose the ability to calibrate? Not if they're talking me through because you could activate me. Oh, you guys are all freaking out. Remember, the universities where we're planning on doing this will not give approval. Unless it is absolutely safe. I can promise you there's no university in the civilized world that is going to let anyone do anything on anyone where there's a potential for damage that is known. No one will allow me to do this unless a very, very tight ass group of people have looked at it and said, this is safe. This is not like you can't just go off and do stuff. You have to get institutional approval. They have structures and they are very, very conservative as to what they let you do. Don't worry, I'm not going to come back like Max Headroom or something. The next question is, can we temporarily induce it with virtual lesions? Probably not, unfortunately, because the virtual lesions are hard to control. Remember, we're talking about surgical strikes here. We're talking about cubic millimeter precision. So probably not too bad, but hey, let's give it one in ten. Let's be generous. Well, if number one turned out, that's a one in ten shot. And number two turned out, that's a one in ten shot. So now we're talking about a one in a hundred shot. But that would mean that we could take people, put them in this state and accelerate their practice. That would be good for the meditators of the world. But like I say, my ambition is much, much bigger. It's like everyone or it's todo o nada. It's like you do the whole thing, we fix the planet or I'm going home. The next thing you'd have to get very lucky is that the medical establishment realizes that this is an alternate, a better way to do a whole bunch of things that they're currently trying to do. Like treat addiction or manage pain or induce general anesthesia or cure depression. For people to be depressed, you have to have negative ideation. There's no such thing as being depressed without intense, incessant negative rumination. People in an athiomorphic state have no rumination at all. They can't ruminate, even if they wanted to. I've got to ask myself, if we had safe, virtual athiomorphia and you took a depressed person and suspended their depression completely for an hour or a week and were guiding them in mindfulness practice the whole time, when that intervention is over, would it have any effect? Who knows? But it's not a ridiculous question. Maybe you get lucky. Maybe you've got a cure for depression. I'll put a monetary value on that. So we'd have to get lucky, number one, and we probably won't. The first lucky is the condition is actually one of enhanced neuroplasticity for acquiring the other factors you need to be liberated. Probably not, but maybe. Then we'd have to induce it safely, reliably, controllably, easily, non-invasively. Is there a way to do that now? Probably not, but maybe. Then it would have to turn out that doing that turns out to solve a lot of standard medical things. We know for sure that people in an athiomormic condition report pain, even intense pain, without suffering. In other words, they feel it, but they don't experience it as a problem. I mean, I've meditated for a long time, but I cannot breathe water as easily as I breathe air. And this guy did in a minute, just because he had a tumor in just the right place. So is this another way to have analgesia, anesthesia? I don't know, but it's not a ridiculous question. So first we have to get lucky the condition is treatable. When we have to get lucky, we can induce it simply, reliably, safely, non-invasively, controllably. These are all big things. And neuromodulation at this point might be able to do that. So that's get lucky number two. Then get lucky number three, it turns out that when you do this, it's not just a nice thing for people that want to meditate, it speeds up your practice. It has one, but I'm guessing if it has one, it probably has a half dozen, significant applications in standard medicine, both physical medicine and psychiatry, addiction recovery. That's get lucky number three. Now how do you compute the probability of the overall success if it's contingent on, let's say, one in ten chance of A, one in ten chance of B, one in ten chance of C? What's the total probability of success? One in a thousand. One in a thousand. It's a tenth. Are you sure about three being one in ten? Are you sure about your third case being one in ten, or do you guess it's one in ten? My guess is somewhere between one in ten and one in a hundred for each of these. So what does that give us? If it's one in a hundred, that gives us a total probability of one one hundredth times one one hundredth times one one hundredth. What's that? That makes it one hundred. If it's ten, it's one tenth times one tenth times ten. It's one in a thousand. So somewhere between a million to one shot and a thousand to one shot I think is reasonable. But the payoff is still going to be in the tens of trillions. So the expected value is just huge. So that's pretty exciting. Question? Yeah. Can you explain why number one is necessary? Well if it's not trainable, then it's not a situation that can be used to accelerate spiritual growth. Number one means... If those subjects have possibly a normal brain that has a temporary lesion, a virtual lesion, I am going to......exclude number two. Yeah, I'm going to guess that because the only thing different about the person with the permanent lesions and the temporary lesions is one is permanent. There's no other difference in the most idealized case of atheanormia. There's a lot of difference that we know of, but there's a few subjects with the condition. It seems to me that it might still be reasonable, even if number one fails, to find a, hopefully not Shenzhen first subject, to step up and have a virtual lesion. I'm guessing since the physical and psychiatric exams on the most idealized atheanormic patient show them as being completely normal, it's most likely that there's nothing else going on there. So that's a nice idea. You didn't have your first sell to the institution that you were also a part of. You didn't have number one success. No, no, actually... Oh, now you're on to something. Okay. Now you're on to what we're actually going to probably do. I don't think I'm going to be able to get access to the atheanormia patients. That's a big deal because it's too rare and I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. So I'm going to make a hypothesis that it's trainable and we're going to go right to the virtual lesion. So you're absolutely correct in that you're totally on the mark with respect to my strategies. We want your brain. So this isn't what I intended to talk about at all. Here we are. Did we get it on camera? It's all on camera. Okay. We've got the record of it. You heard it here first. It's still between one in a thousand and one in a million. But if we get very, very lucky, this is going in the archives, you could all say, I was there when they made that YouTube. The one that has a thousand more views than any YouTube in the history of YouTube because... So that's my thing. Okay, go big or go home. Have you ever got a dark night in a brain scene? No. I don't think someone else has. But what we did capture at Harvard was a physical cessation in one of the participants, a real neuroda where she was gone, gone, gone for a minute or two. We captured that in an MRI scanner. Even though it's been years ago, we still have not gotten around to analyzing that part of the data. It takes forever to analyze this data. But we did capture that, but no, we've never gotten a dark night. Well, I'm sorry. I just got carried away. I was just going to explain why I might not be answering your phone call. Now I filled in the details so you can maybe have some vicarious whatever... Say what? You'll continue to retreat? Oh yeah, yeah. You won't see that much difference, just maybe a little latency in my response. And now we're getting at equanimity. Because he's off on his mad scientist trip doing what he always wanted to do, which is control people's brains. Okay, well, sorry about that. I got carried away. Is there anything we can do to help? Volunteer your brain? No, deepen your practice. That's what helps. It forms the base in the world to deepen your own practice. Because the more people that go deep, it creates a culture where someday some team of researchers will pull off something like this, if we can last long enough. Now, can we last long enough? That's a whole other thing. I'm not going to predict if we're going to make it or not. But if we can somehow just hang on, keep civilization going for another century or so, I would say there's a high probability that some group of people will come up with something like this. And then the world will change rapidly, rapidly for the better. It's the old messianic vision, but not based on mythology, based on logic and evidence. So anyway, so much for that.
