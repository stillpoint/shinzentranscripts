    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=0) |  You do Native American ceremonies. I'd be interested in how you got into that and also |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=16) |  how that fits into the Buddhist, the ritual ceremony, how these two practices are compatible |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=25) |  for you. Sure. The way it started was, gee, I'm thinking maybe at least 25, maybe 30 years |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=38) |  ago, I was running retreats in the Tucson area at a ranch that was owned by a man named |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=46) |  Doug Boyd. Doug Boyd's father is very famous. His name is Elmer Green, and he's one of the |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=53) |  pioneers in brainwave biofeedback, actually. Doug had this ranch that he let us use to |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=63) |  run our mindfulness retreats. The first time we did a retreat out there, he came to me |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=72) |  at the beginning of the retreat and he said, I grew up in Asia, and I've always wanted |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=81) |  to bring good representatives of Asian spirituality together with good representatives of the |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=90) |  Native spirituality of this area, the American Indians from this area, the Arizona area. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=100) |  He tells me he's got a friend named Rupert Encinas, who he describes as a pipe holder, |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=109) |  a sweat lodge leader, and a sun dancer. I had no idea what any of those things implied, |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=118) |  but the way he said it, it sounded like it was important and a big deal. Then he says, |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=125) |  and if you want, at the end of the retreat, he will run a sweat lodge ceremony for your |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=132) |  group. I asked him to describe the sweat lodge ceremony, and he did, and it sounded like, |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=140) |  oh, that could be interesting. That's what happened. When the retreat was over, we told |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=146) |  people, anybody that's interested, you can stay on. One of the local Native American |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=152) |  spiritual leaders named Rupert Encinas is going to take us through a traditional ceremony |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=161) |  called the sweat lodge. A bunch of people did elect to stay, so we did this. I remember |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=172) |  vividly what that experience was. It impacted at all levels. I was just amazed. I was amazed |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=181) |  at how subtle and multi-leveled this thing was. On the surface, it was sort of like just |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=191) |  a physical thing. Hey, we're in a sauna here. We're kind of like sweating for maybe even |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=195) |  health purposes. It sort of had a surface level of maybe a physical cleansing paradigm. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=203) |  Then at a deeper level, it's a religious ceremony. You're praying and so forth. It's also a group |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=212) |  psychotherapy where people are burying their souls. Men are crying. The boundaries and |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=221) |  the inhibitions break down. You're sort of all together in this small hot area. It's |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=227) |  dark. Women are wearing just cotton dresses. Men are in bathing trunks. Very intimate, |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=234) |  very close. There are these intense physical sensations from the heat and whatever. It's |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=239) |  opening people up. It's a group psychotherapy. Whatever anybody says, everybody supports |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=245) |  them. They say, that's good. Wazhtelo, that's good. Hechiduktelo, it's like, yeah, so be |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=258) |  it. It's like this huge supportive environment where people are just letting all this psychological |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=264) |  material out. It's like a group process, a group therapy, group psychotherapy. At another |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=271) |  level, it's a shamanic journey because the intensity of the heat and whatever, you're |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=276) |  starting to go into the power realms and see spirits and the rocks and so forth. At another |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=282) |  level, it matches the Buddhist paradigm of purification equals intensity multiplied by |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=290) |  equanimity. You're in this ceremonial context. Within that context, everything has become |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=299) |  very simple. It's very formulaic. There's nothing to do but just open up, be focused |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=307) |  and be equanimous with the heat and whatever emotions may be coming up. The basic Buddhist |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=313) |  paradigm is intensity plus equanimity equals flavor of purification. Sure enough, Native |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=322) |  people call this a purification ceremony. I could see how it worked at that level. Then, |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=332) |  at a symbolic level, it was the whole idea of expansion and contraction, interplay of |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=341) |  Father Sky and Mother Earth. The pipe has the long stem but it has the earth bowl. You |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=348) |  could see every single thing that they did had that fundamental sense of a simultaneity |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=354) |  of affirmation, negation, expansion, contraction. In other words, it incorporated all of these |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=362) |  levels simultaneously into one ceremony. I remember when it was intense and I'm crawling |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=374) |  out and half passed out. The first thought that went through my mind is, and this was |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=382) |  a facetious thought, it had a facetious tone. The thought was, oh, this is what they mean |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=390) |  by primitive religion. The primitive was in quotes because, of course, it was the antithesis |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=400) |  of primitive. It was so multilayered and so subtle and so integrated. I guess when the |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=410) |  Europeans came here, they saw that the material culture was primitive. A stone axe is not |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=418) |  as good as a steel axe. They just assumed that the people were primitive in all ways |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=426) |  and that their religion was primitive. It was amazing that they were able to do all |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=434) |  these things at once woven into this integrated experience. I got out of there and I just |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=442) |  knew this is for me. That's how I got involved. If I were to say the relationship between |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=451) |  the Native American path and the Buddhist path, I would say that it's a complementarity. |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=459) |  They both move you in the direction of concentration and equanimity. The Buddhist one is sort of |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=471) |  like it's very systematic. That's good. It's sort of a very personal experience. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=479) |  It's sort of not all that flamboyant or fun. You're just sitting there dealing with stuff. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=487) |  Whereas the Native ceremonies are shared. There's a social context. It's fun. You're |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=493) |  singing and you're talking and you're, oh, me talk for y'all singing. You can just |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=498) |  let it all hang out. You get to learn another language. You're singing and you're drumming |
    | [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=504) |  and it's sort of flashy and interesting. I would say for me, the Buddhist practice is |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=512) |  the substance that will always be the cake. I like to have some frosting and that's |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=518) |  the Native American ceremonies. |

     You do Native American ceremonies. I'd be interested in how you got into that and also how that fits into the Buddhist, the ritual ceremony, how these two practices are compatible for you. Sure. The way it started was, gee, I'm thinking maybe at least 25, maybe 30 years ago, I was running retreats in the Tucson area at a ranch that was owned by a man named Doug Boyd.
