    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=0) |  Speaking of motivation, why do this practice, if someone asks you? |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=15) |  If you had to summarize and sort of like simplify, if you had to just say one thing, why do this |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=25) |  practice? I would say so as to be of optimal service to others, if I had to just say one thing. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=37) |  There is this series of pictures from China, but it's also found in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=52) |  called the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. The first YouTube that we ever put up was a talk that |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=61) |  I gave on the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures here, God only knows how long ago, maybe Steph knows. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=69) |  I can look it up. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=71) |  My teachers used them. It's a metaphor that sort of lost probably North Americans, but |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=84) |  anyone from Asia that grew up, particularly the southern parts of Asia, would know what |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=92) |  the metaphor was. Young boys go off into the forest and they look for a young water buffalo. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=104) |  It said ox, but it's actually a water buffalo. They have these very big horns. They find |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=111) |  a juvenile water buffalo and they catch it and they make a relationship with it and tame |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=123) |  it. It's a lifelong relationship. Then as the boy grows up, often they're peasants, |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=133) |  so they're going to be a farmer and the ox grows up and the ox is used for tilling the |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=141) |  fields and also to ride on into town or for pulling carts and things like that. It's a |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=153) |  metaphor for the process of enlightenment. It starts out that you're completely clueless. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=167) |  You're just this kid wandering around without a clue, which is where everyone starts pretty |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=179) |  much. Then you get a clue. The clue is you see the footprints of the ox. You haven't |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=191) |  seen the ox, but there's an indirect indication that this critter exists. That would be maybe |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=201) |  you read a book or you heard a dharma talk or maybe something in your life sort of told |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=208) |  you that there's more to life than what most people think there is in terms of what's possible. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=218) |  So you see the footprints. Then it builds on that. You follow the footprints until you |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=227) |  see the tail. All of you have reached the point where you've seen the tail. If you had |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=236) |  a good meditation, and we've all had good meditations, right? That's sort of seeing |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=244) |  the tail. It's not really the same as seeing the ox, though. That's a little different. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=253) |  Then you see just sort of the rear end of the ox, but you are seeing the ox. Those are |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=264) |  those glimpses that many of you have had of, oh, it's not a stream entry, but it's sort |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=274) |  of like in that direction, but it evaporates. Now you've actually seen the ox, at least |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=284) |  part of it. Then there is seeing the whole ox, and it's like there for you. Now that |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=295) |  could happen suddenly. Often that happens rather gradually over a period of many years. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=303) |  So that's really wonderful. So the ox represents the nature of nature, the nature of consciousness. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=313) |  There's a word in East Asian languages, in Mandarin Chinese, it's shin. In Japanese, |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=320) |  it's almost identical, shin, without a tone. Korean is shim. Vietnamese is tam, which sounds |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=329) |  more like the Cantonese sam, as in dim sum, actually, which means to warm your heart or |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=336) |  touch your heart, literally. So it means heart, but it also means consciousness, sensory experience, |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=351) |  motor experience, broadly, translates cheetah in Sanskrit. So this is the shin-yo. This |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=360) |  is the ox that represents the nature of consciousness, aka sensory and motor experience. So now you've |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=373) |  seen the ox, you've seen the nature of consciousness, but you're not done by any means. In fact, |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=386) |  you've just begun the challenge. As wonderful as it is to have actually seen the nature |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=393) |  of consciousness, which is sometimes called the Buddha nature, or the activity of the |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=406) |  Dharmakaya, the body of the absolute, but it could also be called the activity of impermanence, |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=417) |  aka expansion and contraction. That's the paradigm that I like to use. So once you've |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=425) |  seen it, good, but now you've got to get on it. You've got to rope it, and then you've |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=432) |  got to learn to ride it. And that's very challenging because that ox can buck very intensely. In |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=443) |  other words, stuff happens in your life, in the world, and the ability to stay on that |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=454) |  ox, no matter how intensely it bucks, is a long, long training. But at some point, you |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=468) |  can stay on. And then you ride it home. It just carries you home. Now, that takes you |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=485) |  to the eighth of the pictures. So there's an oral tradition, not a written tradition, |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=498) |  but an oral tradition in Soto Zen. And the only reason I know about it is that a Soto |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=506) |  Zen master told me. So on the internet, you can see one of my YouTubes where I actually |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=523) |  do something that most people in the Buddhist world don't do. I actually describe the moment |
    | [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=531) |  that I saw the whole ox. But there's a tradition in Zen that you're supposed to go to a senior |
    | [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=543) |  master and sort of describe the experience you've had and then see what they have to |
    | [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=556) |  say about it. So I was in the US at that time, so I wasn't in contact with my teachers in |
    | [00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=563) |  Japan. And the only person that I actually personally knew that was like a Zen master |
    | [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=577) |  of great stature and great seniority relative to me at the time was Mayuzumi Roshi. Some |
    | [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=585) |  of you may have heard of him. His lineage is very prominent in US Buddhism, Zen at this |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=593) |  point. So he was the only Roshi that I knew. But I didn't know him very well. I talked |
    | [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=603) |  occasionally because I was living in the Buddhist ghetto, what we used to call the Buddhist |
    | [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=609) |  ghetto, is in Koreatown. It's like where New Hampshire and Vermont and Olympic, that area |
    | [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=618) |  there. A lot of Buddhist centers. There was a Korean center, Talma Sa, where Sun Tzu-Nim |
    | [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=626) |  was, Sun Tzu-Nim, Master Sung San. There was Zen Center of LA where Mayuzumi Roshi was. |
    | [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=633) |  There was the International Buddhist Meditation Center where I was living. So Zen Center of |
    | [00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=642) |  LA was sort of down the street and over the years, you know, we've done things together. |
    | [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=647) |  But I didn't really know Mayuzumi Roshi very well. But he was the only person that I could |
    | [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=653) |  think to go to. I had a bit of trepidation because I didn't really know him that well |
    | [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=666) |  and I'm going to like talk about this thing. You know, a lot of times some of those Zen |
    | [00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=674) |  masters are sort of ferocious. I mean, I knew what I experienced. I wasn't really nervous |
    | [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=685) |  about that, but I thought there's a pretty good probability, you know, the general style |
    | [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=691) |  in Zen is no matter what it is, you're wrong. That is a general style. That may or may not |
    | [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=702) |  be the best pedagogical approach. You'll notice that is not the approach I use, sort |
    | [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=710) |  of the opposite of that. But I had come to expect, you know, whatever it is, you're wrong. |
    | [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=719) |  So I was fully expecting him to say, you're full of shit, kid, get out of here. But I |
    | [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=728) |  don't think it would have bothered me a lot, but it would have been a little embarrassing. |
    | [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=734) |  But he did not say that at all. He said the very opposite of that. So yeah, that's it. |
    | [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=742) |  But you're just starting. And that was a long, that was decades ago. And he was right, just |
    | [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=749) |  starting. So because you see the asuna, you got to get on it and then all this stuff is |
    | [00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=755) |  going to happen and you got to stay on it. So I asked him, is it okay to tell people? |
    | [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=770) |  And he said, well, if you think that it will help inspire people, yeah, you can actually |
    | [00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=779) |  tell people. And he told me about the oral transmission in the Soto Zen school about |
    | [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=797) |  the oxfording pictures, as we were talking about that as a metaphor. So he said that |
    | [00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=805) |  in this oral tradition, which I don't know if it's written down anywhere, but I know |
    | [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=810) |  I heard it directly from him. The last three pictures are not actually stages. The path |
    | [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=821) |  ends at eight, wait, seven, eight, nine, ten, yeah, at seven. So what is eight, nine, and |
    | [00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=835) |  ten? So eight is just a blank page with absolutely nothing on it. Nine is a picture of trees |
    | [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=843) |  and mountains, just like ordinary stuff, the natural world. And ten is a picture of this |
    | [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=854) |  sort of Santa Claus-like guy named Hotei in Japanese, walking into the marketplace with |
    | [00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=871) |  a bag full of goodies and just passing them out to people. And the caption in Chinese |
    | [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=879) |  says entering the marketplace with hand outstretched, four characters. And he said that those last |
    | [00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=894) |  three represent the tai so yu, that's Japanese, ti shan, yong in Mandarin Chinese. They represent |
    | [00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=906) |  the substance, the appearance, and the ultimate use of enlightenment. So the substance is |
    | [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=918) |  the blank page, the appearance is everything, and the ultimate use, the ultimate motivation, |
    | [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=927) |  why we do this in the end, is to be a sort of approachable ordinary person who has this |
    | [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=940) |  secret bag of goodies that you can pass out to anyone who realizes what you have. And |
    | [00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=953) |  you're in the marketplace. Well, let me just say this, the word for marketplace in Persian, |
    | [00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=968) |  you know the word. It's bazaar, which is also where our word bazaar comes from. So in many |
    | [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=976) |  parts of the world, of the pre-modern world, the marketplace is pretty wild. It's like |
    | [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=986) |  all of life is just sort of hanging out there. So you're walking into the bazaar, the bizarreness |
    | [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=996) |  of the world, completely looking like you belong there, and anyone can approach you |
    | [00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1007) |  and you have these goodies to give out. So that is the yu, or the yu in Japanese, which |
    | [00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1013) |  means the purpose, the goal, the ultimate activity. Why you did all the other things, |
    | [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1022) |  why you did all that work with the ox, is so that you could be of significant service |
    | [00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1031) |  to the world. And my first teacher emphasized this a lot. He was a tea master, and when |
    | [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1041) |  I would go to talk about practice, I'd go to his house. Now when you think of a house, |
    | [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1049) |  you're thinking of an American house, okay? You've got to think of a Japanese house, which |
    | [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1053) |  is like about one-tenth the size of an American house. So it was just a couple little rooms, |
    | [00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1064) |  so I was, we didn't be in this room, and he'd make tea for me. And he'd always point out |
    | [00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1070) |  that he had this picture of the Buddha on the wall, a painting, monochrome. And it wasn't |
    | [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1077) |  the usual sort of pictures of the Buddha. The Buddha is walking, and he's walking down |
    | [00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1083) |  the mountain. He's leaving the monastery, so to speak, the ashram, and he's coming down |
    | [00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1093) |  into the city. And he would always say, that's your image, that's the icon that I want you |
    | [00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1104) |  to remember why I'm teaching you all of these things. It's called in Japanese, shussan no |
    | [00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1110) |  shaka, Chushan, leaving the mountain. So if I had to sum it all up, it's to live, to serve |
    | [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1132) |  from love. So where does that come from? How does that come about for a practitioner? Because |
    | [00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1145) |  I can assure you that that wasn't the kind of person I was early in life. I was early |
    | [00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1158) |  in life, the very antithesis of that person. I didn't like being around people at all. |
    | [00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1167) |  I just wanted to be left alone. And I was always uncomfortable around people in general. |
    | [00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1176) |  And I was particularly uncomfortable around people who were uncomfortable themselves, |
    | [00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1183) |  who would be going through something bad in their life or whatever. I just could not handle |
    | [00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1192) |  being around that kind of thing. So what happened? Well, four things happened. I took on this |
    | [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1210) |  practice and it was really hard and I failed over and over and over and over again. Couldn't |
    | [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1218) |  concentrate, couldn't handle the retreats. First two retreats I ever did, I bailed out |
    | [00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1227) |  in the middle. So I got to get the hell out of here. Probably shouldn't tell you that. |
    | [00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1234) |  I'm a good role model. But it's true. I mean, halfway through, I just knew for sure that |
    | [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1245) |  the best thing that I could do to nurture my spiritual essence is get the hell out of |
    | [00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1249) |  here now. And then I'd leave and it's like all the pressure was off and it's like, why |
    | [00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1256) |  did I do that? You know, it happened once and you'd think you'd learn, but then it |
    | [00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1263) |  happened again. The next retreat, halfway through, it's like, I'm out of here. So I |
    | [00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1275) |  would say my early experiences were experiences of being miserable and of not being able to |
    | [00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1285) |  implement a technique. Basically, experiences of failing with the practice. At the time, |
    | [00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1295) |  my interpretation was, of course, I can't do this and I'm no good at this. I'm a failure. |
    | [00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1304) |  I'm a screw up. At the time, that was the impression. It was only years later, years |
    | [00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1315) |  later, looking back, that I realized that those initial experiences of misery and frustration |
    | [00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1328) |  were hugely important for the big picture of my growth. Hugely important. I did not |
    | [00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1339) |  know it at the time, but the seeds of compassion were being planted. Because the first noble |
    | [00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1357) |  truth of Buddhism, the truth of suffering, was so much in my face that it left this impression |
    | [00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1376) |  regarding the importance of not suffering. So that I would say that one of the important |
    | [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1395) |  factors for me personally in changing, becoming a very different kind of person, was failing |
    | [00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1405) |  with this practice and finding this practice difficult and just being miserable. It was |
    | [00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1413) |  Japan, it was zero tolerance policy. We tell you the first day, it's okay to move after |
    | [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1423) |  the bell. Well, not in Zen, not in Japan. You move a muscle and they yell at you or |
    | [00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1432) |  hit you. It would be like in the morning, I can still remember, even though this is |
    | [00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1439) |  almost 50 years ago, I can still remember sitting there and it's like cold and my nose |
    | [00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1450) |  is running, but you can't move and you definitely cannot sniffle. It's like this |
    | [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1462) |  festoons of snot just dripping down, like moistening my clothes and I'm sitting there |
    | [00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1472) |  with this mudra and I'm just miserable. But in retrospect, I realize I was growing |
    | [00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1485) |  and changing in really important ways, just didn't realize it at the time. So I would |
    | [00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1495) |  say that one of the main factors that leads one to the ultimate goal of this practice |
    | [00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1506) |  is the difficulty that we experience early on with this practice. Okay, what other factors? |
    | [00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1520) |  Well I mentioned my teacher. I was indoctrinated in the philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. I |
    | [00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1532) |  was told as a concept, in the end this is why you do it. I think that that indoctrination |
    | [00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1543) |  was a good thing. I'm glad I was told. And guess what? Now you've been told. So I hope |
    | [00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1559) |  you will accept that point of view. So another reason was, well, people told me and I believe |
    | [00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1569) |  them. That's the Bodhisattva spirit. It's Mahayana. So that's a factor, just playing |
    | [00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1578) |  up indoctrination in a certain philosophy about practice. What else? Role models. I |
    | [00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1593) |  saw the same pattern over and over and over again. Different countries, teachers of different |
    | [00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1602) |  race. But it was always the same pattern, which is years of intense practice. And then |
    | [00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1614) |  they're just in the office all day, available to the world. The first time I saw that pattern |
    | [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1623) |  was with someone that some of you know. She's passed away, but her name was Nicola Geiger. |
    | [00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1631) |  How many of you remember Nicola? Well, that's quite a few. Yeah, that was quite a while |
    | [00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1635) |  ago. So how can I put it? If you saw the movie Schindler's List, well, that's what her |
    | [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1651) |  world at the age of 20 was. But not because she was Jewish, actually. She was the opposite. |
    | [00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1659) |  She was from a German aristocratic family. When she was very little, she joined the Deutsche |
    | [00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1672) |  Mädchenbund, the Hitler Youth for the girls, the women, the girls. Because she's just a |
    | [00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1681) |  little girl. She doesn't know any better. It's like all earth and Volksgeist and seemed |
    | [00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1690) |  very appealing. But then when she grew up, she realized the evil of the Nazis. She was |
    | [00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1698) |  part of this group that there was actually, there was the French resistance. That's called |
    | [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1712) |  the self arising. Okay. I need to see you fully manifest. Okay. That's pretty good. |
    | [00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1729) |  I didn't mean to humiliate itself. I mean, I'm so happy that everyone is paying attention. |
    | [00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1736) |  See, now she passed her koan. Say what? I turned off the recording, so I want to put |
    | [00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1747) |  the recording back on. Okay. That was good. You passed the koan. Okay. Okay. We'll just |
    | [00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1759) |  wait. I want to see if you can really pass the koan. Everybody watch Betsy, you fuck. |
    | [00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1777) |  Very intrusive device. There we go. I'm so proud of you. So from the sublime to the ridiculous |
    | [00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1800) |  and now back to the sublime. So yeah, there was the, you know, about the French resistance |
    | [00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1810) |  and whatever, but there were actually people in Germany that were fighting the Nazis secretly |
    | [00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1817) |  when they were in full power during World War II and she was part of that group. They |
    | [00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1825) |  made a movie about them called The White Rose and if you see what happens in that movie, |
    | [00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1831) |  well that's what happened to her and her friends. So just horrible, horrible, horrible. But |
    | [00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1841) |  fortunately she had been taught how to meditate by her father from the time she could crawl. |
    | [00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1853) |  They were associated with the writer Hermann Hesse and you may know the League of Journeyers |
    | [00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1861) |  to the East. There's this classic book called The Journey to the East. This is oral history. |
    | [00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1868) |  I haven't confirmed it, but apparently that actually existed and Nikola's father was part |
    | [00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1875) |  of it and they were Christian, but they were Buddhist influenced during the Weimar Republic |
    | [00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1882) |  between the wars in Germany. Anyway, so she had been taught how to meditate, which is |
    | [00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1890) |  the only reason that she was able to not be completely destroyed by the things that happened. |
    | [00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1905) |  So when I met her, the way I met her is I'd been a Zen monk in Kyoto and you go on begging |
    | [00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1914) |  rounds, I mentioned about that. So there are these rules, very strict rules. You can't |
    | [00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1925) |  go places where you know you're going to get good Dana. You have to go evenly to all places. |
    | [00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1934) |  So you can't like, you know, try to farm the places where it's known that you get good |
    | [00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1941) |  Dana, but still all the Zen monks in Kyoto knew where the good Dana was, even though |
    | [00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1948) |  you weren't allowed because the roots are set. So you have to follow a set route. But |
    | [00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1954) |  if on that particular day, your route takes you by one of the good Dana locations, well, |
    | [00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1961) |  that's good. Why is that good? Well, you don't keep that money. Okay. That goes into a common |
    | [00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1966) |  pot. But the good thing about scoring with good Dana is that you're only allowed to collect |
    | [00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1975) |  to a certain amount. And if someone gives you a big amount, you're done with your Dana |
    | [00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1984) |  rounds. So what you do is you go find a bridge someplace where no one can see you. You go |
    | [00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=1993) |  out in groups of three on these begging rounds. So the three people will like find some place |
    | [00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2002) |  out of sight. And you know what you do? You sleep. Because you're always sleep deprived, |
    | [00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2010) |  right? So good Dana means you're going to get like an hour of sleep if you get score |
    | [00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2015) |  good. But you're not, like I say, you're not allowed to go seek that. But there was this |
    | [00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2021) |  one house where when you would go by it, clearly a foreigner lived there because it said Nikora |
    | [00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2030) |  in Kana on the front door. But a maid would come out and like give you like a big Dana |
    | [00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2041) |  thing. Okay. And so all the monks knew Nikora. So I always thought it was a Russian man because |
    | [00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2049) |  of the name, you know, Nikolai, it's a common. So anyway, I get this letter that signed Nikola. |
    | [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2061) |  And it says, this is when I'm back at Mount Koya, and it says, I'm the director of Friends |
    | [00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2067) |  World College East Asian campus, which is a Quaker International University. And I heard |
    | [00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2080) |  that you're an American and that you're at Mount Koya. Our students don't speak Japanese. |
    | [00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2089) |  So would you be willing to show them around Mount Koya and give them a little lecture |
    | [00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2096) |  on Buddhism in English? Because it's international. So I thought, oh, this must be that Nikola. |
    | [00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2106) |  So I said, yeah, come on up. And I was, like I say, expecting a Russian man. Instead, it |
    | [00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2113) |  was this German housefrow with this really strong accent. And so it was like, okay. And |
    | [00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2127) |  I showed the students around. And she says, if you're ever in the city of Kyoto, come |
    | [00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2135) |  visit me. Here's my address. So a few months go by. Sure enough, I have some business in |
    | [00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2141) |  Kyoto, which as you probably know, is the old capital of Japan. And it's just a few |
    | [00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2146) |  hour drive from Mount Koya. So I go to her house and she says, oh, come up. For some |
    | [00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2158) |  reason, she decided to call me Stefan. Something told her that's my name. So, Stefan, come |
    | [00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2179) |  on up. And so she says, you know why I wanted you to come visit me? And I said, no. And |
    | [00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2195) |  then she proceeded to tell me exactly where I was at with my meditation practice and what |
    | [00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2201) |  I needed to be doing. And it turns out that she was friends with all the great Zen masters |
    | [00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2212) |  in the city of Kyoto. And it was like she had this incredible background. Of course, |
    | [00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2219) |  I couldn't see it. She just looked like an ordinary person. But she could see who I was. |
    | [00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2226) |  And the main thing that she said is, I mean, without talking to me at all, just watching |
    | [00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2233) |  me, it's like she said, yes, I can see that you're able to sort of be in a meditative |
    | [00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2241) |  state, which is pretty good. But you have to learn how to serve people and you have |
    | [00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2247) |  to learn how to be comfortable around people. It's like, well, this is surprising that |
    | [00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2258) |  she could sort of know that. So I observed her and I had a role model. I could see what |
    | [00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2271) |  it was. This is the result of a lifetime of practice. This is the result of having stayed |
    | [00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2282) |  on the ox while you're watching your friends being guillotined. This is the result of having |
    | [00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2289) |  stayed on the ox while Russian troops are raping you. This is the result of staying |
    | [00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2296) |  on the ox when you're being interrogated by the SS and you're 20 years old. What's |
    | [00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2306) |  the result of having done that? Is, oh, just here and available to help people through |
    | [00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2317) |  their stuff. And I saw the entire spectrum of Japanese society walking across her, crossing |
    | [00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2332) |  her threshold over a period of a number of years. Everything from the highest to the |
    | [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2339) |  lowest. From the great masters of Zen to Yakuza, which if you don't know it, well, I'm |
    | [00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2349) |  sure you do know what that is. It's bad news Japanese criminals, right? But she could |
    | [00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2357) |  relate to them. Left-wing terrorists, international terrorists, I couldn't believe it. I mean, |
    | [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2369) |  like criminal terrorists would come and she had something to give them. And everything |
    | [00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2385) |  in between. Just, okay, this is a person that can relate to everyone. That's comfortable |
    | [00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2393) |  around sinners and saints equally. That's a role model. And then later on, I lived in |
    | [00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2404) |  a Chinese monastery, the Chinese master, same thing. Exactly the same thing. And over and |
    | [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2412) |  over again, I saw this pattern. This is where it ends up. You're basically in the marketplace. |
    | [00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2421) |  Not in the sense of selling your wares, but in the sense of just available. After I had |
    | [00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2428) |  completed my hundred days of isolation, my best friend was a Tendai monk. So there's |
    | [00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2440) |  Shingon and there's Tendai. Those are the two schools that were dominant in Japan during |
    | [00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2446) |  the Heian period. Heian is when Kyoto was the capital. Before Zen, before Pure Land |
    | [00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2454) |  and so forth, the two schools were Tendai and Shingon. And each was on a different mountain. |
    | [00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2462) |  Shingon is on Mount Koya and Tendai is on Mount Hiei. Mount Hiei is right next to the |
    | [00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2469) |  city of Kyoto. So my best friend, Kendai-san, was a Tendai monk from Osaka and he was my |
    | [00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2483) |  age. So he said, now that you've completed the hundred days of training, and I thought |
    | [00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2492) |  I was hot stuff after a hundred days. No Westerner had ever done that particular practice. |
    | [00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2498) |  So he said, now that you've done that, I think you can meet my teacher. So come to |
    | [00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2508) |  Mount Hiei, let's go meet my teacher. So his teacher was one of the quote marathon |
    | [00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2516) |  monks of Mount Hiei. You can actually find this on the internet. I think they even have |
    | [00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2523) |  YouTubes of it. There's a documentary. A documentary. Is it on the internet? It's |
    | [00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2529) |  on YouTube. It's on YouTube. I think it's called the Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei. |
    | [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2534) |  But the Japanese don't call them marathon monks. That's a Western term. The Japanese |
    | [00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2541) |  call them Dai-gyo-ma-ajari. Ajari is acharya. It means, it's from the Sanskrit, it means |
    | [00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2548) |  a teacher. It's the same root as acharn in Thailand. So acharya is a teacher, master. |
    | [00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2557) |  Dai-gyo-ma means someone who has completed the great practice. And it is a great practice. |
    | [00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2565) |  Like I say, I thought I was hot stuff after a hundred days in isolation. This is 12 years |
    | [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2572) |  in isolation. And during that 12 years you do a few things that you would not think any |
    | [00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2579) |  human being could do. Like sit for nine days without food or water or sleep. A couple times |
    | [00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2590) |  actually. So I actually am sitting down having a meal with someone who's done that and just |
    | [00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2603) |  sort of shooting the breeze. And talking about practice of course, because that was very |
    | [00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2611) |  salient for me at the time. And he's telling me about the traditions of this 12 year practice |
    | [00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2619) |  on Mount Hiei. So you wouldn't think a person could do it, but people do. And in addition |
    | [00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2636) |  to like the nine day sits, they do these hundred day walks up and down Mount Hiei. So they |
    | [00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2650) |  walk down the mountain into the city of Kyoto, chant mantras and prayers at every shrine |
    | [00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2658) |  and temple, major one in the city, then come back up the mountain. It's done in winter. |
    | [00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2667) |  That walk takes about 20 hours. And they do a hundred of those walks in a row. So that |
    | [00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2681) |  leaves four hours for everything else. Rest, eating, bathing. You wouldn't think a person, |
    | [00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2693) |  that's where the term marathon comes from. You wouldn't think you could survive that, |
    | [00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2698) |  but people do. But you know, my thing is I want to figure out how to work smart so that |
    | [00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2711) |  it's not a, for you folks, it's not a brute force algorithm. Okay. But you work smart |
    | [00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2719) |  so you can get similar effects without having to go through the brutality and intensity |
    | [00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2727) |  of the old school practice. And it is my dream to figure out how to do that because the average |
    | [00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2735) |  person is not going to ever take on something like this. So in any event, when each day |
    | [00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2752) |  of this 12 years, they carry with them a tanto. Tanto is like a short samurai sword. And a rope. |
    | [00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2771) |  Now, it's a symbolism of one of the main deities called Fudo. Fudo is F-U-D-O. You can look |
    | [00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2785) |  up on the internet if you're interested. Achalanata is his name in Sanskrit. And he's sort of |
    | [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2792) |  ferocious looking and he has a rope in one hand and a sword in the other hand. So the |
    | [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2797) |  rope stands for samadhi because you sort of bind attention in a concentrated way. And |
    | [00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2804) |  then the sword or the knife stands for what you think it stands for. That's the wisdom. |
    | [00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2812) |  So it's like the shamatha and vipashyana, right? The rope is samadhi, it's concentrated, |
    | [00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2818) |  and then the wisdom is the sword that cuts through. So they carry the attributes of this |
    | [00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2825) |  bodhisattva, achala, in Sanskrit or fudo, F-U-D-O, in Japanese. But it also has another |
    | [00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2839) |  meaning besides symbolic of the practice. Maybe you can guess. |
    | [00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2849) |  If they fail, they have to commit suicide. |
    | [00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2851) |  Yes. If they cannot complete even one day of the 12-year commitment, they take their |
    | [00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2861) |  own life, either by hanging or, you know, the knife. So, okay, that's, you know, maybe |
    | [00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2875) |  feeling a little weird right now, but in all honesty, that did not make me feel weird at |
    | [00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2883) |  all. I got it. I got it. Once again, I'm not saying I expect anyone to practice that way |
    | [00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2895) |  at all, but I got it when he explained. Because I was still a kid, and so you still ask, I |
    | [00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2907) |  was just 25 years old, so you still ask embarrassing questions. I even love people like that. So |
    | [00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2917) |  I asked him, would you have done it? Would you have actually killed yourself if you couldn't |
    | [00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2923) |  make one day of it? And he said, yeah. And he said, I'll tell you why. Because the only |
    | [00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2939) |  way that we've been able to do this for the last thousand years, and that's how long they've |
    | [00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2945) |  been doing it, on that mountain, the only reason we've been able to keep this up for |
    | [00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2951) |  thousand years, is everyone that does this has made that commitment. And so that, that |
    | [00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2963) |  resolve is what allows us to do this. And my sense of gratitude towards this practice |
    | [00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2976) |  is so great that I'm willing to take my own life in order to maintain this tradition, |
    | [00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2985) |  to make it possible for future generations to do this. So yeah, it's extreme, and yeah, |
    | [00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=2993) |  you don't have to, you know, have the Japanese, you know, suicide pilot, do or die mentality |
    | [00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3006) |  to get enlightened. But I got it. It did not weird me out at all. It just made sense. That's |
    | [00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3015) |  how grateful you are. That's how important it is. So what did he do all day? I got to |
    | [00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3027) |  observe him. Same thing, just like all the other people. He's just there. And people |
    | [00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3033) |  from the village come and people from the city of Kyoto come, and they've got this problem |
    | [00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3039) |  and they've got that problem, and they know what he's been through. In the old days in |
    | [00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3047) |  Japan, they didn't have psychotherapists. People had problems. Where did they go? They |
    | [00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3052) |  went to people like him. And he's got something to give. So one has these role models. One |
    | [00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3065) |  is indoctrinated into a certain philosophy of practice. One is miserable at the beginning |
    | [00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3075) |  a lot. So these are factors that lead to it being quite natural to see the, if you had |
    | [00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3092) |  to just say one thing that this practice is about, it's becoming the person that is approachable, |
    | [00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3100) |  is just there, and has something deep and important to give to a wide spectrum of human |
    | [00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3111) |  beings, in fact the whole spectrum of human beings. Then there's one other factor, and |
    | [00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3118) |  it's also very important. So it's sort of the flip side of failure. The flip side of |
    | [00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3127) |  failure is success. So at some point you see the ox. It might happen suddenly, but it's |
    | [00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3137) |  probably going to just sort of sneak up on you as time goes on. You see the source, and |
    | [00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3146) |  when you see the source, your source, you see everyone's source. And when you finally |
    | [00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3160) |  are able to stay on the ox 24-7, just as before you took on the practice, you could not escape |
    | [00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3175) |  from fundamental alienation. Without this practice, you can't escape from fundamental |
    | [00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3183) |  alienation. Everyone has it, unless something dramatic happens. Fundamental alienation is |
    | [00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3192) |  that rock-solid sense that there is a, that your identity ends with your skin, that there |
    | [00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3199) |  is a tangible barrier between inside and outside. Us versus them, I versus it. It's constantly |
    | [00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3209) |  present in all perceptions. And there's just no escape from it, and everybody assumes it's |
    | [00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3216) |  the nature of reality. But after you've ridden on that ox for a while, you cannot escape |
    | [00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3224) |  the opposite of that. You can't escape it. It's in your face 24-7. Everything you see |
    | [00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3235) |  or hear or touch is being loved into existence right in front of you by this activity of |
    | [00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3248) |  the source, this formless womb. And that's the first thing you perceive. Each time you |
    | [00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3257) |  turn your head or reach out, touch the world, the first thing you perceive before anything |
    | [00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3265) |  else, amor primero, is this cosmic love. And it's just natural to want to be of service |
    | [00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3287) |  to this larger identity. It's just natural. And it's very, very empowering and comforting |
    | [00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3312) |  because just like anyone else, you judge. You like this one, you don't like that one. |
    | [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3323) |  You find this person who's empowered to be wonderful or this person who's empowered |
    | [00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3332) |  to be scary and horrible, just like anybody else. But that comes a moment later. |
    | [00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3344) |  That's a moment later. And therefore, it's just in a very different context. So therein lies |
    | [00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3366) |  the secret to being of use to this world. Love deeply. That's what I mean by love deeply. |
    | [00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no_XaCE969Y&t=3382) |  Act effectively. |

=== "Text"
     Speaking of motivation, why do this practice, if someone asks you? If you had to summarize and sort of like simplify, if you had to just say one thing, why do this practice? I would say so as to be of optimal service to others, if I had to just say one thing. There is this series of pictures from China, but it's also found in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, called the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. The first YouTube that we ever put up was a talk that I gave on the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures here, God only knows how long ago, maybe Steph knows. I can look it up. My teachers used them. It's a metaphor that sort of lost probably North Americans, but anyone from Asia that grew up, particularly the southern parts of Asia, would know what the metaphor was. Young boys go off into the forest and they look for a young water buffalo. It said ox, but it's actually a water buffalo. They have these very big horns. They find a juvenile water buffalo and they catch it and they make a relationship with it and tame it. It's a lifelong relationship. Then as the boy grows up, often they're peasants, so they're going to be a farmer and the ox grows up and the ox is used for tilling the fields and also to ride on into town or for pulling carts and things like that. It's a metaphor for the process of enlightenment. It starts out that you're completely clueless. You're just this kid wandering around without a clue, which is where everyone starts pretty much. Then you get a clue. The clue is you see the footprints of the ox. You haven't seen the ox, but there's an indirect indication that this critter exists. That would be maybe you read a book or you heard a dharma talk or maybe something in your life sort of told you that there's more to life than what most people think there is in terms of what's possible. So you see the footprints. Then it builds on that. You follow the footprints until you see the tail. All of you have reached the point where you've seen the tail. If you had a good meditation, and we've all had good meditations, right? That's sort of seeing the tail. It's not really the same as seeing the ox, though. That's a little different. Then you see just sort of the rear end of the ox, but you are seeing the ox. Those are those glimpses that many of you have had of, oh, it's not a stream entry, but it's sort of like in that direction, but it evaporates. Now you've actually seen the ox, at least part of it. Then there is seeing the whole ox, and it's like there for you. Now that could happen suddenly. Often that happens rather gradually over a period of many years. So that's really wonderful. So the ox represents the nature of nature, the nature of consciousness. There's a word in East Asian languages, in Mandarin Chinese, it's shin. In Japanese, it's almost identical, shin, without a tone. Korean is shim. Vietnamese is tam, which sounds more like the Cantonese sam, as in dim sum, actually, which means to warm your heart or touch your heart, literally. So it means heart, but it also means consciousness, sensory experience, motor experience, broadly, translates cheetah in Sanskrit. So this is the shin-yo. This is the ox that represents the nature of consciousness, aka sensory and motor experience. So now you've seen the ox, you've seen the nature of consciousness, but you're not done by any means. In fact, you've just begun the challenge. As wonderful as it is to have actually seen the nature of consciousness, which is sometimes called the Buddha nature, or the activity of the Dharmakaya, the body of the absolute, but it could also be called the activity of impermanence, aka expansion and contraction. That's the paradigm that I like to use. So once you've seen it, good, but now you've got to get on it. You've got to rope it, and then you've got to learn to ride it. And that's very challenging because that ox can buck very intensely. In other words, stuff happens in your life, in the world, and the ability to stay on that ox, no matter how intensely it bucks, is a long, long training. But at some point, you can stay on. And then you ride it home. It just carries you home. Now, that takes you to the eighth of the pictures. So there's an oral tradition, not a written tradition, but an oral tradition in Soto Zen. And the only reason I know about it is that a Soto Zen master told me. So on the internet, you can see one of my YouTubes where I actually do something that most people in the Buddhist world don't do. I actually describe the moment that I saw the whole ox. But there's a tradition in Zen that you're supposed to go to a senior master and sort of describe the experience you've had and then see what they have to say about it. So I was in the US at that time, so I wasn't in contact with my teachers in Japan. And the only person that I actually personally knew that was like a Zen master of great stature and great seniority relative to me at the time was Mayuzumi Roshi. Some of you may have heard of him. His lineage is very prominent in US Buddhism, Zen at this point. So he was the only Roshi that I knew. But I didn't know him very well. I talked occasionally because I was living in the Buddhist ghetto, what we used to call the Buddhist ghetto, is in Koreatown. It's like where New Hampshire and Vermont and Olympic, that area there. A lot of Buddhist centers. There was a Korean center, Talma Sa, where Sun Tzu-Nim was, Sun Tzu-Nim, Master Sung San. There was Zen Center of LA where Mayuzumi Roshi was. There was the International Buddhist Meditation Center where I was living. So Zen Center of LA was sort of down the street and over the years, you know, we've done things together. But I didn't really know Mayuzumi Roshi very well. But he was the only person that I could think to go to. I had a bit of trepidation because I didn't really know him that well and I'm going to like talk about this thing. You know, a lot of times some of those Zen masters are sort of ferocious. I mean, I knew what I experienced. I wasn't really nervous about that, but I thought there's a pretty good probability, you know, the general style in Zen is no matter what it is, you're wrong. That is a general style. That may or may not be the best pedagogical approach. You'll notice that is not the approach I use, sort of the opposite of that. But I had come to expect, you know, whatever it is, you're wrong. So I was fully expecting him to say, you're full of shit, kid, get out of here. But I don't think it would have bothered me a lot, but it would have been a little embarrassing. But he did not say that at all. He said the very opposite of that. So yeah, that's it. But you're just starting. And that was a long, that was decades ago. And he was right, just starting. So because you see the asuna, you got to get on it and then all this stuff is going to happen and you got to stay on it. So I asked him, is it okay to tell people? And he said, well, if you think that it will help inspire people, yeah, you can actually tell people. And he told me about the oral transmission in the Soto Zen school about the oxfording pictures, as we were talking about that as a metaphor. So he said that in this oral tradition, which I don't know if it's written down anywhere, but I know I heard it directly from him. The last three pictures are not actually stages. The path ends at eight, wait, seven, eight, nine, ten, yeah, at seven. So what is eight, nine, and ten? So eight is just a blank page with absolutely nothing on it. Nine is a picture of trees and mountains, just like ordinary stuff, the natural world. And ten is a picture of this sort of Santa Claus-like guy named Hotei in Japanese, walking into the marketplace with a bag full of goodies and just passing them out to people. And the caption in Chinese says entering the marketplace with hand outstretched, four characters. And he said that those last three represent the tai so yu, that's Japanese, ti shan, yong in Mandarin Chinese. They represent the substance, the appearance, and the ultimate use of enlightenment. So the substance is the blank page, the appearance is everything, and the ultimate use, the ultimate motivation, why we do this in the end, is to be a sort of approachable ordinary person who has this secret bag of goodies that you can pass out to anyone who realizes what you have. And you're in the marketplace. Well, let me just say this, the word for marketplace in Persian, you know the word. It's bazaar, which is also where our word bazaar comes from. So in many parts of the world, of the pre-modern world, the marketplace is pretty wild. It's like all of life is just sort of hanging out there. So you're walking into the bazaar, the bizarreness of the world, completely looking like you belong there, and anyone can approach you and you have these goodies to give out. So that is the yu, or the yu in Japanese, which means the purpose, the goal, the ultimate activity. Why you did all the other things, why you did all that work with the ox, is so that you could be of significant service to the world. And my first teacher emphasized this a lot. He was a tea master, and when I would go to talk about practice, I'd go to his house. Now when you think of a house, you're thinking of an American house, okay? You've got to think of a Japanese house, which is like about one-tenth the size of an American house. So it was just a couple little rooms, so I was, we didn't be in this room, and he'd make tea for me. And he'd always point out that he had this picture of the Buddha on the wall, a painting, monochrome. And it wasn't the usual sort of pictures of the Buddha. The Buddha is walking, and he's walking down the mountain. He's leaving the monastery, so to speak, the ashram, and he's coming down into the city. And he would always say, that's your image, that's the icon that I want you to remember why I'm teaching you all of these things. It's called in Japanese, shussan no shaka, Chushan, leaving the mountain. So if I had to sum it all up, it's to live, to serve from love. So where does that come from? How does that come about for a practitioner? Because I can assure you that that wasn't the kind of person I was early in life. I was early in life, the very antithesis of that person. I didn't like being around people at all. I just wanted to be left alone. And I was always uncomfortable around people in general. And I was particularly uncomfortable around people who were uncomfortable themselves, who would be going through something bad in their life or whatever. I just could not handle being around that kind of thing. So what happened? Well, four things happened. I took on this practice and it was really hard and I failed over and over and over and over again. Couldn't concentrate, couldn't handle the retreats. First two retreats I ever did, I bailed out in the middle. So I got to get the hell out of here. Probably shouldn't tell you that. I'm a good role model. But it's true. I mean, halfway through, I just knew for sure that the best thing that I could do to nurture my spiritual essence is get the hell out of here now. And then I'd leave and it's like all the pressure was off and it's like, why did I do that? You know, it happened once and you'd think you'd learn, but then it happened again. The next retreat, halfway through, it's like, I'm out of here. So I would say my early experiences were experiences of being miserable and of not being able to implement a technique. Basically, experiences of failing with the practice. At the time, my interpretation was, of course, I can't do this and I'm no good at this. I'm a failure. I'm a screw up. At the time, that was the impression. It was only years later, years later, looking back, that I realized that those initial experiences of misery and frustration were hugely important for the big picture of my growth. Hugely important. I did not know it at the time, but the seeds of compassion were being planted. Because the first noble truth of Buddhism, the truth of suffering, was so much in my face that it left this impression regarding the importance of not suffering. So that I would say that one of the important factors for me personally in changing, becoming a very different kind of person, was failing with this practice and finding this practice difficult and just being miserable. It was Japan, it was zero tolerance policy. We tell you the first day, it's okay to move after the bell. Well, not in Zen, not in Japan. You move a muscle and they yell at you or hit you. It would be like in the morning, I can still remember, even though this is almost 50 years ago, I can still remember sitting there and it's like cold and my nose is running, but you can't move and you definitely cannot sniffle. It's like this festoons of snot just dripping down, like moistening my clothes and I'm sitting there with this mudra and I'm just miserable. But in retrospect, I realize I was growing and changing in really important ways, just didn't realize it at the time. So I would say that one of the main factors that leads one to the ultimate goal of this practice is the difficulty that we experience early on with this practice. Okay, what other factors? Well I mentioned my teacher. I was indoctrinated in the philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. I was told as a concept, in the end this is why you do it. I think that that indoctrination was a good thing. I'm glad I was told. And guess what? Now you've been told. So I hope you will accept that point of view. So another reason was, well, people told me and I believe them. That's the Bodhisattva spirit. It's Mahayana. So that's a factor, just playing up indoctrination in a certain philosophy about practice. What else? Role models. I saw the same pattern over and over and over again. Different countries, teachers of different race. But it was always the same pattern, which is years of intense practice. And then they're just in the office all day, available to the world. The first time I saw that pattern was with someone that some of you know. She's passed away, but her name was Nicola Geiger. How many of you remember Nicola? Well, that's quite a few. Yeah, that was quite a while ago. So how can I put it? If you saw the movie Schindler's List, well, that's what her world at the age of 20 was. But not because she was Jewish, actually. She was the opposite. She was from a German aristocratic family. When she was very little, she joined the Deutsche Mädchenbund, the Hitler Youth for the girls, the women, the girls. Because she's just a little girl. She doesn't know any better. It's like all earth and Volksgeist and seemed very appealing. But then when she grew up, she realized the evil of the Nazis. She was part of this group that there was actually, there was the French resistance. That's called the self arising. Okay. I need to see you fully manifest. Okay. That's pretty good. I didn't mean to humiliate itself. I mean, I'm so happy that everyone is paying attention. See, now she passed her koan. Say what? I turned off the recording, so I want to put the recording back on. Okay. That was good. You passed the koan. Okay. Okay. We'll just wait. I want to see if you can really pass the koan. Everybody watch Betsy, you fuck. Very intrusive device. There we go. I'm so proud of you. So from the sublime to the ridiculous and now back to the sublime. So yeah, there was the, you know, about the French resistance and whatever, but there were actually people in Germany that were fighting the Nazis secretly when they were in full power during World War II and she was part of that group. They made a movie about them called The White Rose and if you see what happens in that movie, well that's what happened to her and her friends. So just horrible, horrible, horrible. But fortunately she had been taught how to meditate by her father from the time she could crawl. They were associated with the writer Hermann Hesse and you may know the League of Journeyers to the East. There's this classic book called The Journey to the East. This is oral history. I haven't confirmed it, but apparently that actually existed and Nikola's father was part of it and they were Christian, but they were Buddhist influenced during the Weimar Republic between the wars in Germany. Anyway, so she had been taught how to meditate, which is the only reason that she was able to not be completely destroyed by the things that happened. So when I met her, the way I met her is I'd been a Zen monk in Kyoto and you go on begging rounds, I mentioned about that. So there are these rules, very strict rules. You can't go places where you know you're going to get good Dana. You have to go evenly to all places. So you can't like, you know, try to farm the places where it's known that you get good Dana, but still all the Zen monks in Kyoto knew where the good Dana was, even though you weren't allowed because the roots are set. So you have to follow a set route. But if on that particular day, your route takes you by one of the good Dana locations, well, that's good. Why is that good? Well, you don't keep that money. Okay. That goes into a common pot. But the good thing about scoring with good Dana is that you're only allowed to collect to a certain amount. And if someone gives you a big amount, you're done with your Dana rounds. So what you do is you go find a bridge someplace where no one can see you. You go out in groups of three on these begging rounds. So the three people will like find some place out of sight. And you know what you do? You sleep. Because you're always sleep deprived, right? So good Dana means you're going to get like an hour of sleep if you get score good. But you're not, like I say, you're not allowed to go seek that. But there was this one house where when you would go by it, clearly a foreigner lived there because it said Nikora in Kana on the front door. But a maid would come out and like give you like a big Dana thing. Okay. And so all the monks knew Nikora. So I always thought it was a Russian man because of the name, you know, Nikolai, it's a common. So anyway, I get this letter that signed Nikola. And it says, this is when I'm back at Mount Koya, and it says, I'm the director of Friends World College East Asian campus, which is a Quaker International University. And I heard that you're an American and that you're at Mount Koya. Our students don't speak Japanese. So would you be willing to show them around Mount Koya and give them a little lecture on Buddhism in English? Because it's international. So I thought, oh, this must be that Nikola. So I said, yeah, come on up. And I was, like I say, expecting a Russian man. Instead, it was this German housefrow with this really strong accent. And so it was like, okay. And I showed the students around. And she says, if you're ever in the city of Kyoto, come visit me. Here's my address. So a few months go by. Sure enough, I have some business in Kyoto, which as you probably know, is the old capital of Japan. And it's just a few hour drive from Mount Koya. So I go to her house and she says, oh, come up. For some reason, she decided to call me Stefan. Something told her that's my name. So, Stefan, come on up. And so she says, you know why I wanted you to come visit me? And I said, no. And then she proceeded to tell me exactly where I was at with my meditation practice and what I needed to be doing. And it turns out that she was friends with all the great Zen masters in the city of Kyoto. And it was like she had this incredible background. Of course, I couldn't see it. She just looked like an ordinary person. But she could see who I was. And the main thing that she said is, I mean, without talking to me at all, just watching me, it's like she said, yes, I can see that you're able to sort of be in a meditative state, which is pretty good. But you have to learn how to serve people and you have to learn how to be comfortable around people. It's like, well, this is surprising that she could sort of know that. So I observed her and I had a role model. I could see what it was. This is the result of a lifetime of practice. This is the result of having stayed on the ox while you're watching your friends being guillotined. This is the result of having stayed on the ox while Russian troops are raping you. This is the result of staying on the ox when you're being interrogated by the SS and you're 20 years old. What's the result of having done that? Is, oh, just here and available to help people through their stuff. And I saw the entire spectrum of Japanese society walking across her, crossing her threshold over a period of a number of years. Everything from the highest to the lowest. From the great masters of Zen to Yakuza, which if you don't know it, well, I'm sure you do know what that is. It's bad news Japanese criminals, right? But she could relate to them. Left-wing terrorists, international terrorists, I couldn't believe it. I mean, like criminal terrorists would come and she had something to give them. And everything in between. Just, okay, this is a person that can relate to everyone. That's comfortable around sinners and saints equally. That's a role model. And then later on, I lived in a Chinese monastery, the Chinese master, same thing. Exactly the same thing. And over and over again, I saw this pattern. This is where it ends up. You're basically in the marketplace. Not in the sense of selling your wares, but in the sense of just available. After I had completed my hundred days of isolation, my best friend was a Tendai monk. So there's Shingon and there's Tendai. Those are the two schools that were dominant in Japan during the Heian period. Heian is when Kyoto was the capital. Before Zen, before Pure Land and so forth, the two schools were Tendai and Shingon. And each was on a different mountain. Shingon is on Mount Koya and Tendai is on Mount Hiei. Mount Hiei is right next to the city of Kyoto. So my best friend, Kendai-san, was a Tendai monk from Osaka and he was my age. So he said, now that you've completed the hundred days of training, and I thought I was hot stuff after a hundred days. No Westerner had ever done that particular practice. So he said, now that you've done that, I think you can meet my teacher. So come to Mount Hiei, let's go meet my teacher. So his teacher was one of the quote marathon monks of Mount Hiei. You can actually find this on the internet. I think they even have YouTubes of it. There's a documentary. A documentary. Is it on the internet? It's on YouTube. It's on YouTube. I think it's called the Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei. But the Japanese don't call them marathon monks. That's a Western term. The Japanese call them Dai-gyo-ma-ajari. Ajari is acharya. It means, it's from the Sanskrit, it means a teacher. It's the same root as acharn in Thailand. So acharya is a teacher, master. Dai-gyo-ma means someone who has completed the great practice. And it is a great practice. Like I say, I thought I was hot stuff after a hundred days in isolation. This is 12 years in isolation. And during that 12 years you do a few things that you would not think any human being could do. Like sit for nine days without food or water or sleep. A couple times actually. So I actually am sitting down having a meal with someone who's done that and just sort of shooting the breeze. And talking about practice of course, because that was very salient for me at the time. And he's telling me about the traditions of this 12 year practice on Mount Hiei. So you wouldn't think a person could do it, but people do. And in addition to like the nine day sits, they do these hundred day walks up and down Mount Hiei. So they walk down the mountain into the city of Kyoto, chant mantras and prayers at every shrine and temple, major one in the city, then come back up the mountain. It's done in winter. That walk takes about 20 hours. And they do a hundred of those walks in a row. So that leaves four hours for everything else. Rest, eating, bathing. You wouldn't think a person, that's where the term marathon comes from. You wouldn't think you could survive that, but people do. But you know, my thing is I want to figure out how to work smart so that it's not a, for you folks, it's not a brute force algorithm. Okay. But you work smart so you can get similar effects without having to go through the brutality and intensity of the old school practice. And it is my dream to figure out how to do that because the average person is not going to ever take on something like this. So in any event, when each day of this 12 years, they carry with them a tanto. Tanto is like a short samurai sword. And a rope. Now, it's a symbolism of one of the main deities called Fudo. Fudo is F-U-D-O. You can look up on the internet if you're interested. Achalanata is his name in Sanskrit. And he's sort of ferocious looking and he has a rope in one hand and a sword in the other hand. So the rope stands for samadhi because you sort of bind attention in a concentrated way. And then the sword or the knife stands for what you think it stands for. That's the wisdom. So it's like the shamatha and vipashyana, right? The rope is samadhi, it's concentrated, and then the wisdom is the sword that cuts through. So they carry the attributes of this bodhisattva, achala, in Sanskrit or fudo, F-U-D-O, in Japanese. But it also has another meaning besides symbolic of the practice. Maybe you can guess. If they fail, they have to commit suicide. Yes. If they cannot complete even one day of the 12-year commitment, they take their own life, either by hanging or, you know, the knife. So, okay, that's, you know, maybe feeling a little weird right now, but in all honesty, that did not make me feel weird at all. I got it. I got it. Once again, I'm not saying I expect anyone to practice that way at all, but I got it when he explained. Because I was still a kid, and so you still ask, I was just 25 years old, so you still ask embarrassing questions. I even love people like that. So I asked him, would you have done it? Would you have actually killed yourself if you couldn't make one day of it? And he said, yeah. And he said, I'll tell you why. Because the only way that we've been able to do this for the last thousand years, and that's how long they've been doing it, on that mountain, the only reason we've been able to keep this up for thousand years, is everyone that does this has made that commitment. And so that, that resolve is what allows us to do this. And my sense of gratitude towards this practice is so great that I'm willing to take my own life in order to maintain this tradition, to make it possible for future generations to do this. So yeah, it's extreme, and yeah, you don't have to, you know, have the Japanese, you know, suicide pilot, do or die mentality to get enlightened. But I got it. It did not weird me out at all. It just made sense. That's how grateful you are. That's how important it is. So what did he do all day? I got to observe him. Same thing, just like all the other people. He's just there. And people from the village come and people from the city of Kyoto come, and they've got this problem and they've got that problem, and they know what he's been through. In the old days in Japan, they didn't have psychotherapists. People had problems. Where did they go? They went to people like him. And he's got something to give. So one has these role models. One is indoctrinated into a certain philosophy of practice. One is miserable at the beginning a lot. So these are factors that lead to it being quite natural to see the, if you had to just say one thing that this practice is about, it's becoming the person that is approachable, is just there, and has something deep and important to give to a wide spectrum of human beings, in fact the whole spectrum of human beings. Then there's one other factor, and it's also very important. So it's sort of the flip side of failure. The flip side of failure is success. So at some point you see the ox. It might happen suddenly, but it's probably going to just sort of sneak up on you as time goes on. You see the source, and when you see the source, your source, you see everyone's source. And when you finally are able to stay on the ox 24-7, just as before you took on the practice, you could not escape from fundamental alienation. Without this practice, you can't escape from fundamental alienation. Everyone has it, unless something dramatic happens. Fundamental alienation is that rock-solid sense that there is a, that your identity ends with your skin, that there is a tangible barrier between inside and outside. Us versus them, I versus it. It's constantly present in all perceptions. And there's just no escape from it, and everybody assumes it's the nature of reality. But after you've ridden on that ox for a while, you cannot escape the opposite of that. You can't escape it. It's in your face 24-7. Everything you see or hear or touch is being loved into existence right in front of you by this activity of the source, this formless womb. And that's the first thing you perceive. Each time you turn your head or reach out, touch the world, the first thing you perceive before anything else, amor primero, is this cosmic love. And it's just natural to want to be of service to this larger identity. It's just natural. And it's very, very empowering and comforting because just like anyone else, you judge. You like this one, you don't like that one. You find this person who's empowered to be wonderful or this person who's empowered to be scary and horrible, just like anybody else. But that comes a moment later. That's a moment later. And therefore, it's just in a very different context. So therein lies the secret to being of use to this world. Love deeply. That's what I mean by love deeply. Act effectively.
