    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=0) |  So as far as I know, you have developed a form of teaching that I've never known of |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=14) |  before, interactive guided meditation, where instead of telling someone what to do to meditate |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=23) |  or describing it to a group while they meditate, you one-on-one interactively work with someone |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=32) |  and talk to them while they're meditating, with them talking back to you. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=36) |  Can you tell me how you came up with this? |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=42) |  First let me say, of course, that's not the only way that I teach. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=46) |  I do those other things too, groups and so forth. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=51) |  But what I really love is the one-on-one work, which can be done face-to-face in person, |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=60) |  but also works very well over the telephone, which is enormously convenient because people |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=66) |  that study with me, I give them my telephone number and they can call me when they're in |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=73) |  crisis or when they just need to tune up and so forth. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=77) |  So we can work over the phone also that way. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=81) |  So I can do it face-to-face or I can do it over the telephone with someone. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=88) |  How it developed was that I had my own center in Los Angeles many years ago and we had residents |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=97) |  and they would sit, we would sit as a group early in the morning and then they would go |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=104) |  off and do their jobs and then we'd come back and we'd sit together in the evenings. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=109) |  So what I would do is during the morning sits is I would give them interviews and that's |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=114) |  very standard. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=115) |  You go into a teacher and you sort of talk about your practice. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=119) |  But typically the interviews that are done last for 10 minutes, something like that. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=127) |  You get a chance to ask some questions, we sort of touch base and so forth. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=132) |  So when I started I was doing those kinds of standard interviews and I don't know quite |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=137) |  how it occurred to me but it just sort of gradually dawned on me, well wait a minute, |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=145) |  you know, what's the metaphor for a meditation teacher? |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=149) |  Well there's a lot of possible metaphors. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=152) |  The Buddha described himself as a physician. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=155) |  You know there's a disease called suffering and I have an intervention that is a sufficient |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=162) |  cure for that. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=164) |  So I thought, well what's the metaphor for me? |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=168) |  I'm a coach. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=172) |  So what does a coach do? |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=173) |  Well if you go to the YMCA you ask a staff member to show you how to use the equipment |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=182) |  and then they stand by you and they make sure you're using the equipment properly and they |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=187) |  have good form and they give you some encouragements and they answer your questions and they sort |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=192) |  of check in with you. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=194) |  So I thought, well gee, that's a natural way to go about this. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=200) |  So I started to say, okay, do this and then I would just sit with them and do my own meditation |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=207) |  and then so ten minutes later, okay, when you did that, what happened? |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=213) |  And they would say, well this happened or that happened. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=216) |  And then I would say, okay, it means this or I think you should modify it just a little |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=223) |  bit, it might help and so forth. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=226) |  And we'd like sit for a few more minutes and we'd do that. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=230) |  And I started to notice it was really working. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=235) |  Because when you first learn how to meditate, if you're working in the mindfulness tradition, |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=244) |  you're really wearing two hats. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=247) |  On one hand, you're the meditator. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=250) |  On the other hand, you're trying to observe yourself and that's very tricky. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=254) |  It's very hard to do that until you internalize the skill. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=258) |  So if somebody interactively guides you, you can let go of the hat of being the meditator. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=266) |  You just follow their guidance and you can stay with your experience. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=273) |  So as time went on, I started to develop a more and more elaborate decision tree until |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=282) |  it became this incredibly powerful algorithm that just loops and branches until the person |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=290) |  has a breakthrough experience and works with a high degree of reliability. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=299) |  So it's a combination of you not having to wear the two hats plus the sort of presence |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=307) |  of an experienced teacher as a sort of contact high kind of impact. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=317) |  Plus the sharing of a lot of expert knowledge because I know the windows of opportunity |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=324) |  that nature presents literally minute to minute. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=329) |  Nature is constantly presenting people with windows to transcendence. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=334) |  People don't know how to recognize it. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=337) |  When I'm working interactively with somebody, I spot when a window is open and I point them |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=343) |  in that direction. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=345) |  It just works like a charm. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=347) |  And that's where it's really like a designer meditation because when someone does a guided |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=353) |  meditation, you're still handing over the wheel. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=356) |  Someone else is still driving on that. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=359) |  But what this does is it know two guidances. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=363) |  I think I've been guided privately in meditation over the years with you. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=366) |  I don't know how many times, dozens and dozens, and it's never been the same way twice. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=373) |  So I think of it kind of as a designer meditation in that moment using those opportunities. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=380) |  Yes, that's the general idea. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=383) |  The trick is not so much knowing how to answer your questions. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=390) |  The trick is for me to know what are the important questions. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=394) |  That's what's taken all the years. |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=396) |  To find out what are the important things to look for as a person meditates. |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=402) |  So I know what the right questions are, the most significant ones. |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=407) |  The questions for you to ask? |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=408) |  The questions that I ask you as you're meditating. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=412) |  That's been the challenge. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=414) |  And then to find optimal answers for each one of those questions. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=418) |  So if I ask you ten questions that are absolutely fundamental, and let's say each one has two |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=428) |  possible answers, that means after ten questions I have found the one out of a thousand guidances |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=435) |  that is optimal for you. |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=438) |  If I ask you twenty questions, which could easily happen in an hour period of practice, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=444) |  I have found the one out of one million guidances that is optimal for you. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=451) |  So it's like having a tape library with a million tapes and a wizard that decides for |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=457) |  you what is optimal for you by asking you the right questions. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=462) |  So yeah, you bet it works. |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=463) |  We're off to see the wizard. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=464) |  You bet it works. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=465) |  That's why it works. |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=466) |  Well, that plus the other things we talked about. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=469) |  Very effective. |

     So as far as I know, you have developed a form of teaching that I've never known of before, interactive guided meditation, where instead of telling someone what to do to meditate or describing it to a group while they meditate, you one-on-one interactively work with someone and talk to them while they're meditating, with them talking back to you.
