    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=0) |  Well, now this is really interesting because this, to me, this is the modern upaya. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=17) |  We're reaching out to people. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=18) |  Now what I decided to do was, okay, if we're flying under the banner of an attentional |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=27) |  skill set, well, we want them to apply these skills in a way that they're going to dramatically |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=41) |  grow. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=42) |  So I outlined this in the What is Mindfulness, what this whole strategy is. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=51) |  So the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=57) |  off the bat. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=60) |  So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of concentration kind of |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=65) |  thing, but they're explicitly developing concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity, and they're |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=71) |  learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=79) |  can arise without us trying to get them to believe a certain thing. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=86) |  So we're going to provide you with an attentional skill set, we're going to provide you with |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=91) |  a way of analyzing your sensory experience, which is, it's not any doctrine or belief |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=97) |  system, it's obviously is the case that we see and we hear and we feel. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=104) |  And then people can hopefully start to have really significant experiences. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=113) |  So that to me is a modern and incredible opportunity for upaya. |
