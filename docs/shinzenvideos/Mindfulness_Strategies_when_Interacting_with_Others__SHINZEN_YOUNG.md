    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=0) |  Now, on retreats, we normally are keeping silence. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=16) |  But I got a note about in daily life when we're talking to people, how can we formulate |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=29) |  strategies for meditating or for doing a practice when talking to people? |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=37) |  Well, sometimes when you're talking to someone, it's a substantive conversation. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=45) |  So you really need like 100% of your CPU to be carrying on that. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=52) |  So in those cases, you just have to accept the fact that you can't actually implement |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=58) |  a, or you, no, I don't want to put it that way, you may not be able to implement an intentional |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=67) |  strategy because you have to just be paying attention to what's going on. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=72) |  However, there is a gradation in our conversations with people with regards to how substantive |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=83) |  the conversations are. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=86) |  A lot of conversations that we have with people are not, do not require our total CPU, if |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=94) |  you follow my metaphor, to be engaged with that person. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=99) |  So we get an interesting figure ground reversal here. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=105) |  Normally good conversations are ones that are substantive. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=109) |  And just listening to somebody blabber or shoot the breeze with vacuous social |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=126) |  clichés or what have you, those are considered like not great conversations. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=132) |  But here's where the figure ground reversal comes in. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=136) |  Those now become the great conversations. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=139) |  You understand why? |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=142) |  Because you've got some wiggle room, you've got some extra energy that you can use to |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=152) |  implement a formal strategy. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=157) |  So you can just listen to people talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=166) |  talk, okay? |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=167) |  And it's great, the more they talk and the less you talk, the easier it is to continue |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=174) |  implementing your technique. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=177) |  So it gives you a completely different way of thinking about interactions. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=182) |  So then you train yourself. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=185) |  You are responding to them, you're not spacing out, but you're training a variety of possible |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=196) |  focus strategies. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=197) |  So what are some of the things that you could train under these circumstances? |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=203) |  Well one thing is you can use part of the focus out thing. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=212) |  You can anchor yourself in the sights and sounds of that person. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=218) |  You're really listening and you're really looking. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=223) |  That's one strategy. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=225) |  Another strategy is meta in the body. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=231) |  You sort of, you know, we look at people, we smile, it's sort of a social convention, |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=238) |  but you can use Samadhi to inflate that social smile into a real like whole body experience |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=248) |  of unconditional love just pouring out of your pores. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=256) |  It can be trained and it's very, very powerful once you learn how to do this. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=262) |  So one of my most common strategies for meditating in conversations is, okay, the sights and |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=273) |  sounds of the person or the loving kindness kind of thing. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=279) |  Other strategies are possible. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=281) |  The important thing is you sort of pick your battles. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=286) |  You say, okay, guess what? |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=288) |  In this conversation, I got enough wiggle room that I can respond appropriately and |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=295) |  be implementing this technique. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=300) |  So people often worry though, well, if I'm implementing a formal technique while having |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=306) |  a conversation with someone, number one, people have two worries. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=314) |  First it's like, well, I'll get so involved in the technique that I won't be able to |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=319) |  be appropriate. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=320) |  That's the worry number one. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=323) |  Worry number two is I'm going to look weird or they're going to see that I'm like secretly |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=328) |  doing this, whatever. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=331) |  Okay, so let's address the first concern. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=337) |  Like the proverbial, you know, pat your head and rub your belly. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=342) |  Or is it, yeah, I guess it's that way. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=347) |  That's really hard. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=350) |  Okay, whatever. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=356) |  So you might be a little awkward initially, but people usually don't notice. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=367) |  And then you gain some facility to it. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=370) |  You can keep the technique going and, you know, respond and you don't feel awkward at |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=376) |  all. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=377) |  So yeah, you might need to be willing to feel a little bit awkward initially because you're |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=383) |  not using the ordinary strategy that we use when we're having conversations with people. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=390) |  The ordinary strategy that we use when we have conversations with people is we're constantly |
    | [00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=396) |  going into our see-in, hear-in, feel-in system to plan what we're going to say next. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=405) |  Constantly being pulled back into the subjective world. |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=408) |  Now you're starting to, I mean, of course that could be a technique. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=412) |  You could be observing your see-in, hear-in, feel-in reactions to that person. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=417) |  However, in that case, you're observing them. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=419) |  You're not actually buying into them or using them to plan what you're going to say next. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=426) |  So, that's where the little awkwardness may come in for a little while because it's like |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=433) |  whatever strategy you're doing, even if it's observing your reactions, certainly if it's |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=438) |  a focus out or a radiate love from your body thing, you're not constantly now going back |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=446) |  to see-in, hear-in, feel-in to figure out what you're going to say next. |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=452) |  And if you pay close attention, you'll see that's what we constantly do. |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=457) |  So you might feel a little bit awkward, yes, initially. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=465) |  But then you learn that you actually don't need to constantly go to that place in order |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=471) |  to be appropriate. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=476) |  So that takes care of concern number one. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=479) |  Concern number two, well, they'll know that you're like doing a technique. |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=483) |  Well, guess what? |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=485) |  Your technique is not to disengage from them. |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=490) |  You are anchoring in their sights and sounds or you are radiating in all directions, including |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=497) |  their direction, unconditional positive regard. |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=501) |  So in fact, you're more engaged with them. |
    | [00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=504) |  In fact, what disengages people is that constant pulling towards your own mind and emotions |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=512) |  that's reactive or planning and so forth. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=515) |  So if that doesn't happen, then actually people feel that you're like really giving them attention. |
    | [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=525) |  You're giving them time and space and people find that very attractive. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=533) |  The less something you have inside yourself as you're interacting with a person, that |
    | [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=545) |  sort of emptiness is like a magnet. |
    | [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=551) |  That person, unless they're an experienced practitioner, has a constant pressure of seeing, |
    | [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=557) |  hearing, and feeling. |
    | [00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=559) |  You're now learning how to communicate with that person without having within yourself |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=564) |  that constant pressure of seeing, hearing, and feeling. |
    | [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=568) |  That creates, in a good sense, a vacuum inside you. |
    | [00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=573) |  So it's like an osmotic gradient or a pressure gradient. |
    | [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=577) |  The ego pressure that they have can dissipate in the space of your ego absence. |
    | [00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=585) |  And that creates a force that attracts people towards you, a kind of magnetic force. |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=593) |  They don't know why, but they're pulled by that pressure gradient, if my metaphor makes |
    | [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=601) |  any sense at all. |
    | [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=602) |  So be willing to take a chance and start flapping your lips without planning what you're saying. |
    | [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=612) |  And as you get better and better and better at that, you will eventually learn how to |
    | [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=617) |  ride the ox backwards. |
    | [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=619) |  That's a Zen metaphor. |
    | [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=621) |  The flow of expansion and contraction itself will begin to move your lips and tongue for |
    | [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=629) |  you. |
    | [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=630) |  And you'll discover that magically powerful and appropriate things are moving across your |
    | [00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=641) |  teeth without you actually quite even knowing until it's too late. |
    | [00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=649) |  But then it's like the magic happened. |
    | [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=652) |  It takes a long time to train the ability to do that. |
    | [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=657) |  And you have to be willing to somewhat throw caution to the wind and just, as I say, start |
    | [00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=663) |  manifesting. |
    | [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=664) |  A lot of times people work against themselves in meditation practice because they go into |
    | [00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=671) |  like some really deep state and then the bell rings and it's like, oh, I got to reconstitute |
    | [00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=678) |  myself in order to be able to deal with the world. |
    | [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=682) |  Well, that's like wasting what you just did. |
    | [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=688) |  Okay. |
    | [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=689) |  It's like, no, the whole idea is you're in this really deep state, you're sort of spacious |
    | [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=697) |  and disoriented. |
    | [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=700) |  The bell rings, time to deal with the world. |
    | [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=705) |  Just continue to be spacious and disoriented and start moving. |
    | [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=710) |  And yeah, there might be a little awkwardness initially, but you'll discover that all that |
    | [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=718) |  is needed is the activity of the personality. |
    | [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=722) |  The somethingness of the ego is not really necessary to navigate the world and to interact |
    | [00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=734) |  with one's fellow beings. |
    | [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=736) |  So the whole idea is it's like the bell rings and no, don't like, okay, I got to get myself |
    | [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=741) |  in the world solid again. |
    | [00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=744) |  No, no, no. |
    | [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=747) |  You just start being space, moving through space and let the manifestation occur. |

=== "Text"
     Now, on retreats, we normally are keeping silence. But I got a note about in daily life when we're talking to people, how can we formulate strategies for meditating or for doing a practice when talking to people? Well, sometimes when you're talking to someone, it's a substantive conversation. So you really need like 100% of your CPU to be carrying on that. So in those cases, you just have to accept the fact that you can't actually implement a, or you, no, I don't want to put it that way, you may not be able to implement an intentional strategy because you have to just be paying attention to what's going on. However, there is a gradation in our conversations with people with regards to how substantive the conversations are. A lot of conversations that we have with people are not, do not require our total CPU, if you follow my metaphor, to be engaged with that person. So we get an interesting figure ground reversal here. Normally good conversations are ones that are substantive. And just listening to somebody blabber or shoot the breeze with vacuous social clichés or what have you, those are considered like not great conversations. But here's where the figure ground reversal comes in. Those now become the great conversations. You understand why? Because you've got some wiggle room, you've got some extra energy that you can use to implement a formal strategy. So you can just listen to people talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk, okay? And it's great, the more they talk and the less you talk, the easier it is to continue implementing your technique. So it gives you a completely different way of thinking about interactions. So then you train yourself. You are responding to them, you're not spacing out, but you're training a variety of possible focus strategies. So what are some of the things that you could train under these circumstances? Well one thing is you can use part of the focus out thing. You can anchor yourself in the sights and sounds of that person. You're really listening and you're really looking. That's one strategy. Another strategy is meta in the body. You sort of, you know, we look at people, we smile, it's sort of a social convention, but you can use Samadhi to inflate that social smile into a real like whole body experience of unconditional love just pouring out of your pores. It can be trained and it's very, very powerful once you learn how to do this. So one of my most common strategies for meditating in conversations is, okay, the sights and sounds of the person or the loving kindness kind of thing. Other strategies are possible. The important thing is you sort of pick your battles. You say, okay, guess what? In this conversation, I got enough wiggle room that I can respond appropriately and be implementing this technique. So people often worry though, well, if I'm implementing a formal technique while having a conversation with someone, number one, people have two worries. First it's like, well, I'll get so involved in the technique that I won't be able to be appropriate. That's the worry number one. Worry number two is I'm going to look weird or they're going to see that I'm like secretly doing this, whatever. Okay, so let's address the first concern. Like the proverbial, you know, pat your head and rub your belly. Or is it, yeah, I guess it's that way. That's really hard. Okay, whatever. So you might be a little awkward initially, but people usually don't notice. And then you gain some facility to it. You can keep the technique going and, you know, respond and you don't feel awkward at all. So yeah, you might need to be willing to feel a little bit awkward initially because you're not using the ordinary strategy that we use when we're having conversations with people. The ordinary strategy that we use when we have conversations with people is we're constantly going into our see-in, hear-in, feel-in system to plan what we're going to say next. Constantly being pulled back into the subjective world. Now you're starting to, I mean, of course that could be a technique. You could be observing your see-in, hear-in, feel-in reactions to that person. However, in that case, you're observing them. You're not actually buying into them or using them to plan what you're going to say next. So, that's where the little awkwardness may come in for a little while because it's like whatever strategy you're doing, even if it's observing your reactions, certainly if it's a focus out or a radiate love from your body thing, you're not constantly now going back to see-in, hear-in, feel-in to figure out what you're going to say next. And if you pay close attention, you'll see that's what we constantly do. So you might feel a little bit awkward, yes, initially. But then you learn that you actually don't need to constantly go to that place in order to be appropriate. So that takes care of concern number one. Concern number two, well, they'll know that you're like doing a technique. Well, guess what? Your technique is not to disengage from them. You are anchoring in their sights and sounds or you are radiating in all directions, including their direction, unconditional positive regard. So in fact, you're more engaged with them. In fact, what disengages people is that constant pulling towards your own mind and emotions that's reactive or planning and so forth. So if that doesn't happen, then actually people feel that you're like really giving them attention. You're giving them time and space and people find that very attractive. The less something you have inside yourself as you're interacting with a person, that sort of emptiness is like a magnet. That person, unless they're an experienced practitioner, has a constant pressure of seeing, hearing, and feeling. You're now learning how to communicate with that person without having within yourself that constant pressure of seeing, hearing, and feeling. That creates, in a good sense, a vacuum inside you. So it's like an osmotic gradient or a pressure gradient. The ego pressure that they have can dissipate in the space of your ego absence. And that creates a force that attracts people towards you, a kind of magnetic force. They don't know why, but they're pulled by that pressure gradient, if my metaphor makes any sense at all. So be willing to take a chance and start flapping your lips without planning what you're saying. And as you get better and better and better at that, you will eventually learn how to ride the ox backwards. That's a Zen metaphor. The flow of expansion and contraction itself will begin to move your lips and tongue for you. And you'll discover that magically powerful and appropriate things are moving across your teeth without you actually quite even knowing until it's too late. But then it's like the magic happened. It takes a long time to train the ability to do that. And you have to be willing to somewhat throw caution to the wind and just, as I say, start manifesting. A lot of times people work against themselves in meditation practice because they go into like some really deep state and then the bell rings and it's like, oh, I got to reconstitute myself in order to be able to deal with the world. Well, that's like wasting what you just did. Okay. It's like, no, the whole idea is you're in this really deep state, you're sort of spacious and disoriented. The bell rings, time to deal with the world. Just continue to be spacious and disoriented and start moving. And yeah, there might be a little awkwardness initially, but you'll discover that all that is needed is the activity of the personality. The somethingness of the ego is not really necessary to navigate the world and to interact with one's fellow beings. So the whole idea is it's like the bell rings and no, don't like, okay, I got to get myself in the world solid again. No, no, no. You just start being space, moving through space and let the manifestation occur.
