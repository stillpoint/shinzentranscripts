    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=0) |  The ancient Taoists had experienced the same thing and had an interesting phraseology for it. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=15) |  It relates to jing qi shan, which are terms that you may be familiar with if you've studied Asian medicine |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=29) |  or martial arts and so forth. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=31) |  So jing means essence, literally. So essence of what? |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=36) |  Well, in terms of sensory experience, often in the process of completing an experience, |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=48) |  a certain flavor has to sort of get distilled and dominate your awareness. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=59) |  And that distillation of that experience could be described in Chinese as jing, or essence. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=67) |  Now in the Taoist practice, this particular distillation that they often worked with was sexual sensation. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=77) |  But this can be generalized to any kind of experience, and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the body, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=86) |  although it's sort of easiest to understand there, but the same thing can happen in visual and in auditory. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=95) |  You sort of... everything gets distilled. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=99) |  So let's say, for example, you are working on having fear no longer be an issue for you. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=114) |  How can that be? Because there's so many circumstances of fear in this world, |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=122) |  so many legitimate reasons to be afraid. It just goes on and on and on. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=129) |  How can it be that a human being could become a human being for whom fear is no longer an issue? |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=139) |  Broader still. If you can do that, well, why not add in grief and sadness? |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=148) |  Or anger? Or on a more mundane note, that frenetic impatience that we have all day, |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=162) |  that comes out when you're in a traffic jam? |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=169) |  Which is very ordinary, but actually a source of significant suffering in the world. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=178) |  And now at the other extreme, what you would hardly think any human being could ever come to grips with, |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=190) |  shame and embarrassment. How about that one? |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=194) |  So anger, fear, sadness, embarrassment, impatience, disgust. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=201) |  Those are the big six on the negative side of flavors of human emotion. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=210) |  I know for sure that a human being can reach the point where those are no longer an issue for them. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=227) |  So how is that possible? How is it possible to do with all of those? |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=231) |  How is it possible to do with even one of those? |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=234) |  Well, first you have to be willing to allow it to distill into an essence. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=247) |  What that means is that particular favor, whichever one it is, anger, fear, sadness, |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=257) |  each one has its own very distinct quality in the body. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=263) |  So the essence of fear occurs when there is nothing but the fear sensation. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=276) |  It is in every cubic centimeter of your body, and it is continuous, unbroken in time, for a period of time. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=290) |  Now, we're very, very afraid of what the consequences of that would be. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=301) |  But the fear of the consequences of that is actually what keeps us imprisoned for our whole life. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=309) |  Because the consequences of allowing it to become essence, in the way I've just described, |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=316) |  the consequences are nothing negative at all. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=322) |  The long-term consequences are freedom. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=328) |  But because we're afraid to let it go to that point, very few people become free. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=337) |  So if the shit really hits the fan to the point where you cannot avoid |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=347) |  one or a combination of these negative emotions becoming essence, |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=353) |  well, in a sense that could be a very good thing. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=358) |  So I repeat, there is nothing but that flavor, essentially hardly aware of anything else in the body. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=368) |  It's everywhere, and it's continuous through time. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=374) |  So now you are inundated with the essence of shame, or grief, or fear. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=385) |  Or the impatience associated with being in a traffic jam and you're late to an appointment. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=394) |  That one is just about as hard to work with as all the others. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=398) |  It took me, oh my God, from the time I realized what the task was, |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=405) |  which is what I'm now describing to you, from the time I realized what the task was, |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=412) |  to the time where I could actually do it with that impatience thing in traffic and not suffer. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=421) |  Well, I don't want to... Maybe I shouldn't say this. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=427) |  Twenty years. But the twenty years passed anyway. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=432) |  I know what you're saying, well, I don't have twenty years. |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=437) |  But that's another Dharma talk. I'm going to give a talk about aging. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=442) |  But the quick answer is, aging is a natural state of no-self. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=450) |  So you've got something going for you. |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=454) |  But if you're young and have twenty years, well, it might not take you twenty years, |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=459) |  but it took me twenty years to get to the point where it really felt good, like liberating, |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=468) |  to have that level of essence with impatience. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=476) |  Like I say, if you're already old, you've already got some things going for you, |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=482) |  we'll talk about that later. So there's hope in both cases. |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=490) |  So it becomes essence. |
    | [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=495) |  And then it starts to get sort of liquidy. |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=510) |  化精为气 |
    | [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=513) |  The essence converts into a kind of energy that is first sort of liquidy |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=524) |  and then sort of shimmering and gaseous. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=534) |  And then 化气为善 |
    | [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=543) |  That becomes this effortless, simultaneous, formless, rich doing of space, spaciousness, |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=564) |  effortlessly spreading, effortlessly collapsing. |
    | [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=569) |  And it's at that point that you have a complete experience of that particular essence. |
    | [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=580) |  It has now become 善, pure spirit. |
    | [00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=586) |  Now, as I say, they did this traditionally with sexual sensations. |
    | [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=595) |  So it's the same process. |
    | [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=599) |  The sexual sensation inundates the entire body, there's nothing but that. |
    | [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=607) |  And it's very hard to have equanimity with that. |
    | [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=610) |  It's hard to have equanimity with uncomfortable things, |
    | [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=613) |  but it's also hard to have equanimity with intense pleasures. |
    | [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=617) |  And then it starts to flow everywhere. |
    | [00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=623) |  And then it's sort of like more gaseous. |
    | [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=628) |  And then it's just pure space. |
    | [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=631) |  And that's what the Tibetans called 德同意而美 |
    | [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=634) |  The non-duality of bliss and void. |
    | [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=643) |  So if you can go through that phase progression with just a half dozen negatives, |
    | [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=655) |  it's a small list. |
    | [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=657) |  Unfortunately, each one of those essences, each one of those flavors, |
    | [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=664) |  has been honed by Darwin to control animals. |
    | [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=672) |  And by Darwin I don't mean the man Darwin, |
    | [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=675) |  I mean natural selection over millions and millions of years. |
    | [00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=680) |  So it is very hard to allocate all your resources |
    | [00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=693) |  to having a complete experience of these things, |
    | [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=696) |  because everything in the sensation says, |
    | [00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=703) |  I got to do something about this, I got to do something about this, |
    | [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=705) |  I got to do something about this, |
    | [00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=707) |  because those sensations have been honed by evolution |
    | [00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=711) |  to make animals do something quickly about something. |
    | [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=719) |  Either approach it and eat it, or run away from it, etc. etc. |
    | [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=727) |  Or make love to it, etc. etc. etc. |
    | [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=733) |  So it's very hard to just allocate the totality of your resources towards completing. |
    | [00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=741) |  But all you have to do is do that a few times, |
    | [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=746) |  or well, more than a few times, a few hundred times. |
    | [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=751) |  And then it becomes habitual. |
    | [00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=754) |  Then for the rest of your life, |
    | [00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=756) |  you will have experiences in your emotional world |
    | [00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=763) |  that are maximally poignant and minimally problematic. |

     The ancient Taoists had experienced the same thing and had an interesting phraseology for it.
