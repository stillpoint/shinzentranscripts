    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=0) |  But, but, but, there's another possibility. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=12) |  And this one is yet another subtlety, but it is so cool once you get it. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=20) |  Okay, and I'm not sure this is what you're talking about, but it's something that I have |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=25) |  to talk about. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=28) |  Okay, so sometimes I'll be working with a first timer, and they're doing focus in, and |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=37) |  they elect to do it with inclusive noting. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=40) |  It's just, I give them the option, and it's like, hey, you know, it's going to be sort |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=44) |  of complicated. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=45) |  No, it's natural. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=46) |  I want to do it that way. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=49) |  Right? |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=50) |  So we're doing see in, hear in, feel in, see hear in, see feel in, hear feel in, all in, |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=62) |  gone, or all rest, gone. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=69) |  And the person reports this. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=77) |  It's not all rest. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=82) |  It's not, but I can't tell you whether, what it is. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=91) |  Okay, I can't say it's see in, hear in, feel in, or what combination, but it's not all |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=98) |  rest. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=99) |  It's not that there's no image, no talk, no emotion in the body. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=104) |  It's not all rest, but I can't tell you what's going on. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=111) |  Sounds like a problem, but actually it's not a problem. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=117) |  It's the beginning of something really cool. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=124) |  What's happening, so what you say is, okay, you're not aware of explicit image, talk, |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=135) |  or emotional body, but those spaces are also not in a restful state. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=145) |  What's going on? |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=146) |  Well, what do you think is going on? |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=151) |  Sub-processing. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=155) |  Subconscious processing. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=157) |  So the whole Western psychological tradition is based on Freud's quote, discovery of the |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=165) |  subconscious. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=166) |  Well, guess what? |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=168) |  People in India knew about the subconscious two, three thousand years before there was |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=174) |  a Freud in Europe. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=179) |  And they knew how to observe the subconscious in real time. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=185) |  Now you can't observe the subconscious visual, auditory, and somatic the way you observe |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=191) |  the conscious, because by definition it's subconscious. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=198) |  However you can be aware when a burst of activity arises in subconscious thought and emotion, |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=208) |  and you can be aware when that burst of activity passes. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=214) |  How are you aware of that? |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=216) |  Well sometimes you're aware because of a shimmering on the screen that tells you that the Rolodex |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=226) |  is being flipped through deep down, where there's this sort of undercurrent of talk. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=232) |  It's massively parallel, like listening to a room full of people. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=236) |  You can't make out any strand of a conversation, but you know stuff's going on down there. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=243) |  Same for this sort of like idling in your emotional centers. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=249) |  Nothing's engaged. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=250) |  You can't say it's anger, fear, sadness, but the emotional centers are sort of on idle. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=258) |  You can actually see it in a baby. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=260) |  You can see the amoeba that is the idling of the limbic circuits in a baby. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=270) |  The baby's not crying. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=272) |  The baby's not smiling, okay, but the baby's sort of... |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=279) |  That's their body responding to the sub-threshold activations of the limbic system, okay, that's |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=290) |  just expanding and contracting. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=292) |  Well, it's still there in adults. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=294) |  So one way that you can know, that you can monitor in real time these systems is by noting |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=301) |  sort of subtle activity, subtle flow within them. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=305) |  However, this is the part that's really cool and really subtle. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=313) |  You may not even be aware of that undercurrent of something, but you're aware that image |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=321) |  space is tugging you. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=326) |  Talk space is tugging you. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=330) |  Emotional feeling space is tugging you, but there's no awareness of any activity, but |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=336) |  there's an awareness of a tug of space. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=339) |  That's why it's so important to have a sense of the locations of the spaces. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=347) |  So when you're doing focus in and it's not all rest, you will notice that the non-rest |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=356) |  is that you're being tugged towards one, two, or all three of those spaces. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=362) |  That is the cue that there is a very... |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=366) |  At that instant, the subconscious mind has started to activate in one, two, or all three |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=374) |  of those spaces. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=376) |  And you note that as seeing, hearing, feeling, even though... |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=380) |  Okay, so it's not all rest. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=383) |  There's no explicit activity that you're aware of, not even a vibratory flow, but there is |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=389) |  this tug. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=390) |  That's why this triangle, okay? |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=394) |  There's a tug here, there's a tug here, there's a tug down here, or all three at once, or |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=402) |  what have you. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=403) |  That tug, when your emphasis is on detecting interactivity, that counts as the subtlest |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=411) |  level of interactivity. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=413) |  And you just say yes. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=415) |  Even though you don't know what you're saying yes to, you say yes to the tug. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=419) |  And guess what? |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=422) |  At some point, that's all that the subjective system needs. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=427) |  It just needs you to say yes to its amoeboid subliminal flux. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=434) |  And you go back to that state of the baby. |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=437) |  And that's the extent to which the ego needs to be a thing for you, which ain't much of |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=444) |  a thing. |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=447) |  This was hugely subtle. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=450) |  Don't worry. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=451) |  I'll say it again and again and again. |
