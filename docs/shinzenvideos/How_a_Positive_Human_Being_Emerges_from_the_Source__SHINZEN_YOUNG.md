    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=0) |  I was wondering where cultivating positive or identifying positive exists within both |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=17) |  gone. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=18) |  Well, the question is, where is positive within both gone? |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=24) |  It's not. That's sort of the whole point. No positive, no negative. This is as close |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=32) |  as you get to the non-human as you can get. However, the great parents, so intrinsically, |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=44) |  there is no love, there is no hate there, intrinsically. But still, that's hitting a |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=52) |  human being. We're still a human being. And when we get hit by the impersonal, that tends |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=60) |  to trigger a sense of deep human love. But it's not intrinsic to the impersonal. It's |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=71) |  intrinsic to the fact that you're still a human being. And touching that, which is, |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=84) |  as is said, strikes down God and the devil simultaneously. So you would think, well, |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=92) |  that's a little bit more like the devil than God. Because it's like, where's ethics, |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=102) |  where's love? But that's the central mystery. When the human touches the non-human, the |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=110) |  human is nurtured and improved by way of reaction. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=115) |  So touching the non-human source is, when you come back, the ripples of love are there? |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=126) |  That's pretty much it. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=131) |  So then the authentic person is in the source, but not in the ripples of love? |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=140) |  Well, the authentic person is the puppeteer. And the puppet that that invisible hand is |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=157) |  inserted into very much will be manifesting love and compassion in the world. So it's |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=169) |  the power source. You can think of it on an analogy of broadcasting. So there's the wattage |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=185) |  of the station. That's power, that's joules per second. That's the rate at which energy |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=196) |  is going out. However, the wattage is not the only parameter of a radio or TV station. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=208) |  There's a modulation that goes on, on that wattage that carries a message. It could be |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=214) |  music, it could be, okay, and it can modulate either amplitude or frequency. But the point |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=219) |  is, there's a message that's riding on that energy wave. It's modulated or encoded. But |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=229) |  it's not the energy wave itself. The energy wave is just pure energy. So that's inside |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=236) |  the puppet, is that energy wave. But the surface of the puppet should be unapproachable, abstract, |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=249) |  admirable, helpful human being. That's what I call classical enlightenment, or class C |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=260) |  enlightenment, as opposed to crazy wisdom or other things that people do, where the |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=267) |  surface is not necessarily unapproachable, admirable, helpful, and ordinary human being. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=278) |  So that's how I look at it. So if somebody is in touch with the source and also in touch |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=285) |  with being beneficial to other human beings, they're going source here, source here, |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=293) |  source here, source here, something like that? Well, you can use different metaphors. You |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=301) |  could use an alternating metaphor, but I sort of like the spatial metaphor of there's space |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=310) |  inside you that's sort of animating you, anima. There's different possible metaphors. So, |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=323) |  yeah, that's one way to think about it. |
