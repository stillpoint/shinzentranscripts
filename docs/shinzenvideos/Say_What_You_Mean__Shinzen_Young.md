    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=0) |  So, one of the things that I really encourage people to do is train themselves to quote |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=12) |  say what you mean. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=15) |  You know where I got this phrase from? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=18) |  Say what you mean? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=22) |  It's from literature actually, sort of classic in English literature. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=31) |  It's by a book, it's, the author of the book is named Charles Dodson. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=42) |  Doesn't ring a bell? |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=44) |  Well that was his real name. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=46) |  His nom de plume was Lewis Carroll. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=56) |  So Lewis Carroll is known as the writer of children's books and Charles Dodson is known |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=63) |  as the Victorian period mathematician. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=68) |  There's even a theorem named after him. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=71) |  Not a theorem but a mathematical process. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=74) |  And in fact, uh oh, now I'm going to get on a geek out. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=77) |  Okay, so I've got to rein myself in. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=80) |  This is the problem, okay. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=83) |  I just sort of, whatever comes up pours out. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=89) |  So the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, it contains a pun that almost no one realizes. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=101) |  A mathematical pun. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=104) |  Tea was also a letter that was used as a variable, okay, in his day by people who were |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=120) |  insisting on the use of imaginary numbers and complex variables and things like that. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=127) |  Dodson was actually a very old fashioned kind of mathematician. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=131) |  He was more in the old fashioned Euclidean mathematics. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=136) |  And he actually didn't like the new math, the new math of the Victorian period, which |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=143) |  probably seems like very old math. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=145) |  But actually he was like wrong. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=151) |  Complex variables turned out to be like this hugely, hugely useful thing, which I'll give |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=157) |  a whole Dharma talk on one of these days. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=161) |  In any event, yeah, so the tea is a mathematical pun, the tea party. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=168) |  Anyway at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party, there's a dialogue with Alice and the Marsh Hare and |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=178) |  the Dormouse and the Mad Hatter, in which each of those people tell Alice in no uncertain |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=190) |  terms to mean what you say is completely different from saying what you mean. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=198) |  The Mad Hatter says, said something like, you need to say what you mean. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=203) |  Alice says, well I always mean what I say. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=205) |  And then they get on this big riff about, hey, these aren't the same at all at all at |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=209) |  all. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=210) |  To say what you mean means that you have an idea, and when it comes out in words, it's |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=218) |  accurate. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=220) |  And it turns out that that's not such an easy thing to do. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=227) |  It takes a lot of training, a lot of care. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=234) |  We're not stupid, we know what we're saying, and in our mind it's evidence-based and logical, |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=242) |  but if you really listen to yourself saying it, okay, sometimes you're not really saying |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=250) |  what you mean. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=251) |  What's in your mind is not what the words actually are. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=255) |  So I've spent a long, long time trying to train myself to be careful about that, and |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=263) |  I'm a little bit, how shall I say, finicky, prissy, fussy about you folks learning how |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=276) |  to do the same thing, because I think it's extremely useful. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=281) |  But it's also really hard, and the reason that I know it's hard is even though I work |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=291) |  at it and I'm pretty good at it, I'm amazed how many times I myself end up not really |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=299) |  quite accurately saying what I mean, which is, it happens, it's okay. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=310) |  Every once in a while, in retrospect, I look back and I realize to my horror that I said |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=321) |  the opposite of what I meant, and that's like bad, which I did last night. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=333) |  I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, maybe you can guess. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=339) |  What I was trying to convey is that this path is available to the entire spectrum of culture |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=358) |  and philosophy and politics, and that conservative people, which I refer to as, quote, Republicans |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=367) |  and so forth, should be as comfortable within this setting as any other people. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=378) |  I glory at the notion that that is the case, can be the case, but it came out sounding |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=384) |  like I was sort of making fun of conservative and Republican people. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=389) |  That is actually the way it came out, which was exactly the opposite of what I had in |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=394) |  my head. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=395) |  So, bad, bad, bad, which someone pointed out to me, and I said, okay, when you're right, |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=403) |  you're right. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=404) |  So, anyway, that's, I think, a really important point. |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=412) |  The types of people that in our culture would be called conservatives were the types of |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=422) |  people that in the context of Asia were my teachers, and they saved my soul. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqwdLfL6u48&t=431) |  So, anyway, just wanted to mention that. |
