    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=0) |  What is unique and important? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=7) |  When I look at the different kinds of things that I like to teach, |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=13) |  I'll sometimes ask myself, what is unique and important? |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=20) |  Are there some things I've come up with that no one came up with |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=24) |  and that may be important historically? |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=31) |  I think there are. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=35) |  One is the notion that |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=42) |  three attentional skills, concentration, clarity, equanimity, as I've defined them, |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=48) |  give you everything that you need with no extra baggage |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=55) |  to completely analyze any form of contemplative-based psychospiritual growth |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=63) |  and also to compare all historical traditions |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=74) |  of contemplative-based psychospiritual growth. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=79) |  You can analyze every single path in terms of the extent to which |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=85) |  and the way in which, if at all, it talks about each one of these skills. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=93) |  That is like a three-dimensional analysis that can be used |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=97) |  both for the practical of an individual's meditation practice |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=105) |  but also as a framework for a systematic theory of world mysticism. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=115) |  I think that's probably important and it's unique, I think. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=125) |  Another thing is what I just mentioned, |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=132) |  realizing that mental image, mental talk, and body emotion work together as a system. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=141) |  What I essentially have done is take the early Buddhist idea, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=147) |  something that goes back either to the Buddha or to just a few centuries after the Buddha, |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=152) |  something very associated with Theravada, |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=156) |  which is the notion that if you untangle the strands of self, you get free. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=163) |  Well, I'm going to claim that inner Sikhir feel represents |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=171) |  the most tangible and simplest way to implement that divide and conquer |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=178) |  or untangle and be free. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=179) |  Furthermore, that it probably maps onto functional neuroanatomy |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=185) |  and therefore could be the basis, once again, |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=189) |  for a biophysical theory of enlightenment sometime in the future. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=195) |  So that's important. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=198) |  There's one other thing, which is if you want to look for a biological basis for enlightenment, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=214) |  I'm going to make a guess. This is just a guess. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=219) |  I might whistle another tune in a year or two, |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=224) |  but I'm going to, for the record, say, |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=229) |  look at the basal ganglia. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=234) |  Okay, so that could be the single most important thing I ever said in my life. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=243) |  Or not. We'll see. |

     What is unique and important? When I look at the different kinds of things that I like to teach, I'll sometimes ask myself, what is unique and important? Are there some things I've come up with that no one came up with and that may be important historically? I think there are.
