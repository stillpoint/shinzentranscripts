    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=0) |  The focusing out sounds interesting, so does the positive, but I think the focusing out |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=10) |  sounds very interesting. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=12) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=13) |  So you'll remember I said that we would very carefully define terms. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=18) |  So external sounds we'll call sound. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=25) |  External sights we'll call sight. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=28) |  And then physical sensations in your body we'll call touch. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=33) |  So I'm going to describe a technique and I want you to tell me if it makes sense. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=38) |  If all you're aware of is touch, I'd like you to say out loud touch and focus on that |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=44) |  for a second. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=45) |  We'll call that noting. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=47) |  If all you're aware of is touch, note touch. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=49) |  If all you're aware of is sight, note sight. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=52) |  If all you're aware of is sound, note sound. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=54) |  If more than one is available, just choose one to note. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=58) |  Intently focus on that for a few seconds and then note again either the same thing or something |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=69) |  else. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=70) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=71) |  Are my eyes supposed to be open? |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=72) |  They will be in a minute. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=73) |  Oh, okay. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=74) |  So when you say sight you mean with the eyes open. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=77) |  But I wanted you to prepare with your eyes closed just to get settled. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=81) |  So let me just repeat. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=82) |  When I focus on touch I'm focusing on body sensations like sitting in the chair or clothes |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=90) |  or just any sensation that's not emotional and that's touch. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=95) |  Sight would be what I see with my eyes open and sound is sound. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=100) |  That's correct. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=101) |  Okay. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=102) |  Now what's going to pull you away from touch, sight, sound is your reactions to it which |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=106) |  is feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=108) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=109) |  Yes. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=110) |  Or my thoughts. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=111) |  Yes. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=112) |  Feel, image, talk could take the form of reaction to touch, sight, sound or it could go off |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=118) |  on its own and spin memory, plan, and fantasy. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=123) |  So you'll be constantly pulled towards feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=130) |  When that happens just let go of that and focus on touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=135) |  It's sort of expansive concentration. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=138) |  The contractive world of thought and emotion pulls in and you work against that expanding |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=145) |  out into touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=146) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=147) |  So by expanding out you mean I'm moving what I'm aware of to the outside world? |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=154) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=155) |  And you're letting go of the inside world. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=156) |  That's good. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=157) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=158) |  Right. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=159) |  So you're like anchoring yourself in the power of now. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=165) |  The touches, the sights, and the sounds are always now. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=168) |  So that will weaken the gripping power of fantasy, memory, planning, and judgmentalness. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=177) |  So we're going to start to make it simple. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=182) |  I'm going to have you just do touch and sound for a second and then we'll add sight. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=188) |  So I'd like you to say those labels out loud. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=194) |  Just when my awareness is on it I'm like... |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=196) |  That's correct. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=197) |  Okay. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=198) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=199) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=200) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=201) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=202) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=203) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=204) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=205) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=206) |  Sound. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=207) |  Sound. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=208) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=209) |  Touch. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=210) |  That's perfect. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=211) |  Meaning the tone of voice, the pacing, and the wording. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=212) |  That's exactly how to do it. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=213) |  And I'm aware of both at the same time but I'm just picking the one. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=226) |  You're selectively trying to pour your attention on just one. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=232) |  That's the divide and conquer, one thing at a time kind of thing. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=236) |  Okay good. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=237) |  Now we're going to up the ante. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=238) |  Open your eyes and include sight. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=243) |  Let your eyes just do whatever they want to do. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=246) |  And now you're going to have three possible things. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=249) |  Okay. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=250) |  Well, sight is big. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=254) |  So I'm just adding sight. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=255) |  Just add that but touches and sounds may pull you in also. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=262) |  Sight. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=265) |  Sight. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=268) |  Touch. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=271) |  Sound. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=274) |  Sight. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=277) |  Sight. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=280) |  Sound. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=283) |  That's perfect. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=284) |  Instead of saying the words out loud, do it mentally. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=290) |  So you're just going to think the labels touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=319) |  You're able to do that pretty good. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=339) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=340) |  It takes all... |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=342) |  There's not room to do anything else. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=344) |  It takes all your concentration just to do it. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=348) |  So I think you could see potentially this would pull you out of obsessive thoughts. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=353) |  There's no room for obsessive thoughts. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=355) |  And you can also see that you could do this in motion while you... |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=360) |  You could be moving housework, even when you get good at it, talking to people. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=366) |  And you could still... |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=367) |  I'm doing it now as I'm talking to you. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=369) |  You're going to... |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=370) |  Sight. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=371) |  And then you can think of what to say. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=372) |  No, I don't... |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=374) |  We didn't get into it, but remember I said base level of concentration, clarity? |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=379) |  Eventually it just goes on autopilot. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=381) |  I'm doing it now without having to make even the mental labels, but I'm aware. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=386) |  Is it touch, sight, sound that I'm focusing on? |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=388) |  I'm trying to do it too. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=391) |  So that allows you... |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=392) |  And I think you can see it builds... |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=394) |  You feel like you're more focused, right? |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=397) |  That's the concentration piece. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=398) |  It's interesting. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=399) |  My whole sense of being here, I realize how much my sense of who I am is really... |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=404) |  You know, oh, that voice in my head that's telling me where to go and you're going to |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=408) |  be late, or... |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=409) |  It's all in here and kind of focused here. |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=411) |  And there's something about this that makes my whole sense of what I am bigger. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=417) |  As my awareness moves out there, and like I said, it doesn't leave room for my chatter, |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=425) |  my incessant chatter in my head. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=427) |  It takes a break. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=428) |  I'm not aware of it until afterwards. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=431) |  And obviously it's activated now again as I talk, but... |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=435) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=436) |  That's the general idea. |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=437) |  Great. |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=438) |  There you go. |

=== "Text"
     The focusing out sounds interesting, so does the positive, but I think the focusing out sounds very interesting. Okay, good. So you'll remember I said that we would very carefully define terms. So external sounds we'll call sound. External sights we'll call sight. And then physical sensations in your body we'll call touch. So I'm going to describe a technique and I want you to tell me if it makes sense. If all you're aware of is touch, I'd like you to say out loud touch and focus on that for a second. We'll call that noting. If all you're aware of is touch, note touch. If all you're aware of is sight, note sight. If all you're aware of is sound, note sound. If more than one is available, just choose one to note. Intently focus on that for a few seconds and then note again either the same thing or something else. Does that make sense? Are my eyes supposed to be open? They will be in a minute. Oh, okay. So when you say sight you mean with the eyes open. But I wanted you to prepare with your eyes closed just to get settled. So let me just repeat. When I focus on touch I'm focusing on body sensations like sitting in the chair or clothes or just any sensation that's not emotional and that's touch. Sight would be what I see with my eyes open and sound is sound. That's correct. Okay. Now what's going to pull you away from touch, sight, sound is your reactions to it which is feel, image, talk. Does that make sense? Yes. Or my thoughts. Yes. Feel, image, talk could take the form of reaction to touch, sight, sound or it could go off on its own and spin memory, plan, and fantasy. So you'll be constantly pulled towards feel, image, talk. When that happens just let go of that and focus on touch, sight, sound. It's sort of expansive concentration. The contractive world of thought and emotion pulls in and you work against that expanding out into touch, sight, sound. Does that make sense? So by expanding out you mean I'm moving what I'm aware of to the outside world? Yes. And you're letting go of the inside world. That's good. Yeah. Right. So you're like anchoring yourself in the power of now. The touches, the sights, and the sounds are always now. So that will weaken the gripping power of fantasy, memory, planning, and judgmentalness. So we're going to start to make it simple. I'm going to have you just do touch and sound for a second and then we'll add sight. So I'd like you to say those labels out loud. Just when my awareness is on it I'm like... That's correct. Okay. Touch. Touch. Touch. Touch. Touch. Touch. Touch. Touch. Sound. Sound. Touch. Touch. That's perfect. Meaning the tone of voice, the pacing, and the wording. That's exactly how to do it. And I'm aware of both at the same time but I'm just picking the one. You're selectively trying to pour your attention on just one. That's the divide and conquer, one thing at a time kind of thing. Okay good. Now we're going to up the ante. Open your eyes and include sight. Let your eyes just do whatever they want to do. And now you're going to have three possible things. Okay. Well, sight is big. So I'm just adding sight. Just add that but touches and sounds may pull you in also. Sight. Sight. Touch. Sound. Sight. Sight. Sound. That's perfect. Instead of saying the words out loud, do it mentally. So you're just going to think the labels touch, sight, sound. You're able to do that pretty good. Yeah. It takes all... There's not room to do anything else. It takes all your concentration just to do it. So I think you could see potentially this would pull you out of obsessive thoughts. There's no room for obsessive thoughts. And you can also see that you could do this in motion while you... You could be moving housework, even when you get good at it, talking to people. And you could still... I'm doing it now as I'm talking to you. You're going to... Sight. And then you can think of what to say. No, I don't... We didn't get into it, but remember I said base level of concentration, clarity? Eventually it just goes on autopilot. I'm doing it now without having to make even the mental labels, but I'm aware. Is it touch, sight, sound that I'm focusing on? I'm trying to do it too. So that allows you... And I think you can see it builds... You feel like you're more focused, right? That's the concentration piece. It's interesting. My whole sense of being here, I realize how much my sense of who I am is really... You know, oh, that voice in my head that's telling me where to go and you're going to be late, or... It's all in here and kind of focused here. And there's something about this that makes my whole sense of what I am bigger. As my awareness moves out there, and like I said, it doesn't leave room for my chatter, my incessant chatter in my head. It takes a break. I'm not aware of it until afterwards. And obviously it's activated now again as I talk, but... Yeah. That's the general idea. Great. There you go.
