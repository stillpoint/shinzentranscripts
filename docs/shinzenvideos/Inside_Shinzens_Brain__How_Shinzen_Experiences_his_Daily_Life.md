    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=0) |  I'm interested in what happens inside your brain in any given day. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=12) |  Obviously from doing this practice for as long as you've been doing it, |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=18) |  you're functioning in a different way. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=21) |  And I remember you telling me of how they hooked you up one time |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=25) |  to get your brain studied at the University of Arizona. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=30) |  And the technician came in to you and said, |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=35) |  now don't start meditating yet until we turn on the equipment. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=39) |  And you said, as if I could stop. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=42) |  And you used the analogy of saying it's as if you asked someone with a lot of muscles |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=48) |  to just don't have muscles for a minute. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=50) |  It's so much a part of how you function. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=53) |  I'd like you to give me a taste of what it's like inside your brain |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=61) |  in any given day as best you can. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=65) |  Just in terms of your processing, |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=68) |  I know you've talked about meditating in the visual field. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=73) |  I would just be, if you could just give me a taste of how you process your experience |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=81) |  and what's deliberate, applying a technique and what just happens. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=86) |  If I were to give the big picture of what my days are like, |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=93) |  I would say that typically on any given day, |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=100) |  my experience ranges from a scattered and unconscious, |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=108) |  in a sense as though I had never meditated. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=112) |  I'm choosing my words carefully. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=115) |  In a sense as though I had never meditated. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=118) |  It ranges from that to a direct contact with the spiritual source involving |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=130) |  literally seeing through this world as I'm bopping around within it, |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=137) |  which is also an experience of myself and the world arising from and returning to the source. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=149) |  So my experience ranges between something like a person that has never meditated |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=158) |  and something like absolute oneness with absolute fulfillment. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=168) |  It ranges between those. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=173) |  The main feature, what the impact of the 40 years of practice is, |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=179) |  is I don't have much preference between those two states. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=186) |  Someone once asked a Roshi in my presence what his definition of enlightenment is. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=195) |  He said, |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=197) |  悟りと悟りでないとの区別がなくなることでしょう。 |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=203) |  Which in Japanese means, I guess you could say enlightenment is the passing away |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=209) |  of the distinction between enlightenment and non-enlightenment. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=214) |  That was Mayuzumi Roshi, a very famous Roshi in Los Angeles. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=219) |  He has many students all over the world, great students that are doing great work. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=225) |  So anyway, it ranges from completely deluded to quasi-enlightened without a preference between those. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=236) |  And that's what's just naturally arising, that's not with an applied effort of any... |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=243) |  That's correct. If there's an applied effort, |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=245) |  then obviously it starts to valence towards that state of energy and emptiness. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=254) |  But the main feature in daily life is there's not a preference, |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=258) |  which is in stark contrast to when I began my practice, |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=262) |  and probably in stark contrast to just about where everyone begins, |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=267) |  because when you begin, you want something. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=269) |  You want to think you're getting somewhere. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=271) |  You want certain experiences. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=273) |  So my early years of practice were preoccupied with comparing maps |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=280) |  and finding every possible experience and every description, |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=285) |  and then needing to have all of those experiences, |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=287) |  and wanting to have this or that happen. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=290) |  Which is what I think a lot of people... |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=293) |  You've got to start somewhere, so that's sort of natural. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=296) |  So I would say the biggest change that has taken place is that |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=301) |  I don't have that big a preference between enlightenment and non-enlightenment. |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=307) |  That's sort of the big picture. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=309) |  Then if I'm intending to meditate in action, in life, |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=317) |  like I'm talking to you now, okay. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=319) |  So if I'm going to be intentionally meditating, |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=322) |  now I just started to intentionally meditate as we're talking. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=325) |  I typically meditate in the external visual field, |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=330) |  and I typically am meditating on the process of simultaneous expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=337) |  causing the world in front of me to arise and then disappear. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=341) |  So I'm now applying a formal technique. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=344) |  So I'm arising and disappearing right now. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=346) |  You're arising and disappearing from the source, moment by moment. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=349) |  Therefore, you appear to me to be the source, and therefore very effortlessly lovable. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=356) |  I'll take it. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=362) |  But no more lovable than the flower next to you or the garbage can outside. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=371) |  So that would be, now if I'm doing formal practice where I'm seated and my eyes are closed, |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=381) |  I will do any of the five ways that I teach. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=384) |  I use all my own techniques, just sort of depending on interest, opportunity, and necessity. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=391) |  Although recently I've been tending to default to the technique that I call do-nothing, |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=398) |  the do-nothing technique. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=401) |  That's what I've been using recently for my own formal practice. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=405) |  That's a version of focus on rest in terms of a five-way formulation that I use. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=413) |  When you were talking about everything dissolving into and having no preference, |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=419) |  you could in a sense define it in light, because you said, |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=422) |  I now have no preference for enlightenment or not enlightenment, |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=426) |  but is enlightenment then this process of the having no preference? |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=431) |  That's a stage. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=434) |  In other words, first when you start, enlightenment is a figure and the world is a ground. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=441) |  You and the world are the ground and you have this fantasy of enlightenment that's a figure. |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=446) |  At some point there's a shift, a figure-ground reversal, |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=452) |  and you and your world are the figure, and the actual experience of enlightenment is the ground. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=460) |  You may go through many years and in fact decades of preferring to be in that state, |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=469) |  but then that tends to pass away with time. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=473) |  If you want to know what I'm preoccupied with, I am preoccupied just like anybody. |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=480) |  If somebody wakes up and they're preoccupied with money or their health or sex or drugs or whatever, |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=488) |  I'm preoccupied. |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=490) |  There's something I default to as a sort of obsession. |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=496) |  If you understand that's somewhat in quotes, but it would be my version of being obsessed. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=502) |  What obsession is in my consciousness. |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=505) |  The obsession is, can I figure out better ways to bring masses of people to what I experience? |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=516) |  That's what I default to. |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=518) |  It's like, how smart can I be? How creative can I be in the service of the world? |
    | [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=527) |  Not a bad default. |
