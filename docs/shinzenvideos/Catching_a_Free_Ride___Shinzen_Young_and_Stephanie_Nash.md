    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=0) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=4) |  In terms of simultaneous expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=9) |  something that I realized just in the last day or two, |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=13) |  I kind of noted, how much I was appreciating |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=19) |  something that used to be disturbing, |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=22) |  was as soon as something arises it has begun to pass away. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=27) |  And I was appreciating that, |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=29) |  and I was appreciating the space it creates, |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=35) |  and how holding on to something doesn't even occur |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=42) |  when you're working with that. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=45) |  And then I switched to the teacher mind and thought, |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=49) |  okay, what's a fun game that I can create |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=53) |  to help people just kind of touch in on that? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=57) |  And I remembered noting gone with quick sounds, |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=67) |  like the peacocks or the woman with the high heels |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=69) |  or the clock ticking. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=71) |  And I had mentioned before how it reminded me of |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=76) |  when I was in high school and had a Ford Pinto |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=78) |  and lived 1,500 miles away from home, |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=80) |  and I had to drive long distances and had no money, |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=83) |  and I learned to get behind trucks. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=85) |  There was this little parking lot. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=86) |  And what is it, draft? |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=88) |  And I could go forever without using any gas. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=91) |  There was this magic space behind trucks. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=94) |  They don't like that, by the way. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=96) |  Well, it's not because it's dangerous. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=98) |  You shouldn't be doing it. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=99) |  But it was a long time ago and I did it. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=101) |  And because, you know, it was like, oh wow, this is so cool. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=104) |  And it was like there was this magic space |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=107) |  behind the trucks where you got a free ride. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=111) |  And I started thinking of every little... |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=114) |  Because usually when an arising happens |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=116) |  we turn and look at it and then it's gone |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=118) |  before we jump to the arising and we miss the gone |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=122) |  and then the next one comes. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=123) |  And I got to where I was thinking of arisings |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=126) |  as each having this magic space behind them |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=129) |  where you get a free ride. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=131) |  Oh, cool. That's a great metaphor. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=132) |  You know, and so every time something arose |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=135) |  I'd go, free ride, free ride. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=137) |  And it helped me not solidify on the arising. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=142) |  And I was just thinking of that as we... |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=145) |  Today as we were doing this and as I was... |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=147) |  I did that as our middle thing. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=150) |  And I thought, oh, that might be a fun game |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=153) |  to help people just get a taste of not attaching |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=159) |  to the solidity of the arising. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=163) |  As we say in the industry... |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=166) |  Can I use that? |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=171) |  Eddie, no. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=172) |  No, he didn't come back. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=174) |  That was for him. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=179) |  Oh, that's great. Free ride. Okay. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=183) |  Life may not be a free lunch, but it is a free ride. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=186) |  It is a free ride. |

     Yes.
