    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=0) |  So, what prompted me to bring up that koan was this little fellow here, okay, because |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=25) |  I can't think of a better iconic representation of enlightenment than this. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=34) |  Okay, there we go. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=38) |  Yeah, it's fun, isn't it? |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=41) |  It is fun. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=42) |  Why is it fun? |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=43) |  Why do we like watching this? |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=46) |  There is a reason, and it's called Helmholtz free energy, I'm reasonably sure. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=59) |  I would say that we all ride on a kind of effortless just happeningness that is the |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=78) |  nature of consciousness. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=80) |  So when I say the word emptiness within, say, the Buddhist context, what image comes to |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=91) |  your mind? |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=93) |  Well, maybe an image of vastness. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=100) |  I would say that's not incorrect, but it's exactly half the picture. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=107) |  I think for a lot of people, when they hear Buddhists talk about emptiness, the image |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=113) |  that comes to their mind is some sort of bleakness. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=123) |  It's like you bust your buns for 40 years on the cushion and what do you have to show |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=128) |  for it? |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=129) |  Emptiness. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=130) |  It's like, what? |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=131) |  Maybe that's another rabbi and Roshi joke. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=147) |  The Roshi says we attain emptiness. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=152) |  The rabbi says, that's garnished. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=155) |  Okay, you have to know Yiddish. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=160) |  Garnished means bubkus. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=164) |  It means who wants that? |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=167) |  It's nothing. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=169) |  Okay. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=170) |  However, when I first encountered the word emptiness, I was a student of Buddhism academically. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=181) |  Dongbanye in Tibetan, Shunyata in Sanskrit, Kong in Mandarin Chinese, Ku in Sino-Japanese. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=193) |  I knew it in many Asian languages. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=197) |  It was just this weird idea that I didn't have any image of. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=202) |  It's like, what the heck? |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=206) |  As I say, a lot of people probably think of bleakness, some people think of vastness. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=214) |  But the reason I so like this little tchotchke that Charlie brought is for many, many years |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=226) |  now when I use the word emptiness and when I hear the word emptiness within the Buddhist |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=234) |  context, this is exactly what my image is. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=240) |  Bounciness, springiness. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=247) |  In 1660, Robert Boyle wrote a foundational work on pressure. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=261) |  And a year later, he wrote a foundational work on chemistry, which interestingly he |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=267) |  called the skeptical chemist. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=271) |  It was a scathing critique of Aristotelian and Paracelsian alchemy, essentially, and |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=280) |  is thought of as the beginning of modern chemistry. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=284) |  But the year before he wrote that, he wrote something that was subtitled, and I just love |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=293) |  the title of this, Touching the Spring of the Air. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=301) |  That's how they, back in those days, talked about pressure. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=306) |  It's like the springiness of the air, touching the spring of the air. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=312) |  And that is what the experience of emptiness is for me as a meditative experience. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=324) |  It's directly touching the spring of the void. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=332) |  And so I just mention this as something to know about. |
