    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=0) |  How can meditation help you love deeply? |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=10) |  Meditation can help you love deeply. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=14) |  And in fact, without it, it's probably going to be very difficult to love deeply, |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=21) |  in the sense that I'm using the term. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=24) |  Meditation can also help you act effectively, |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=27) |  and there's a lot more to acting effectively than just what meditation can bring. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=34) |  There's many, many, many specifics. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=38) |  But the one thing that meditation does help, in terms of acting effectively, |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=43) |  is it helps our actions to be motivated and directed by our emotions, |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=55) |  as opposed to being driven and distorted. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=61) |  When I look out at the world and I see stuff that upsets me, |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=70) |  that causes rage, terror, grief, shame, a sense of helplessness, |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=78) |  which is pretty much the 6 o'clock news every night, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=86) |  what I try to remember is, in the end, in the deepest analysis, why is this happening? |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=98) |  There's surface analysis, and that's important, |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=102) |  but for me as an individual, in that moment, |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=108) |  the most important thing is to not forget, because it's really easy to forget, |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=114) |  not forget deeply why this doo-doo is occurring. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=120) |  And deeply why this doo-doo is occurring, |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=124) |  that this doo-doo can be any one of the gazillion things that is the litany of horrors of the 6 o'clock news. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=135) |  Deeply, it's not because human beings get together and try to create bad stuff. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=143) |  That doesn't happen very often. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=146) |  Human beings get together and try to solve stuff, |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=151) |  but the solutions are typically driven and distorted by suffering. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=159) |  And so, they're suboptimal. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=162) |  Now, sometimes that's okay, because one's suboptimal in this way, |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=167) |  and the other's suboptimal in this way, and they sort of cancel out, |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=170) |  and we sort of muddle through. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=173) |  So, sometimes that's okay, but sometimes, |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=177) |  a whole bunch of people will be suboptimal in exactly the same way, |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=182) |  and then it reinforces and turns into something horrible. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=188) |  So, I try to remember, okay, |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=192) |  how many millions of people for how many decades or centuries |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=199) |  experienced rage, grief, shame, terror, |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=205) |  and such, just like I'm experiencing right now, |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=209) |  and they did not remember to experience it fully. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=218) |  So, it caused a drivenness, a distortedness in their solution-seeking, |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=225) |  and the effect of those bad decisions, |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=230) |  a lot of times they just cancel out, it's okay, |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=232) |  but if they don't cancel out, they all line up, |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=236) |  and we get horrible, horrible things. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=241) |  So, I try to remember in that moment, okay, |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=246) |  it may seem like less than a drop in the bucket, |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=249) |  but I want to make sure that I'm doing my part at the deepest level |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=256) |  to improve the human condition at the deepest level. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=267) |  That doesn't preclude taking action at other levels, |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=271) |  but for that moment, when it hits me, |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=275) |  I want to be able to have, I want to, |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=281) |  metaphor, it's a little maybe humorous or it might sound even cavalier, |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=287) |  but I think the secret is the opposite of the James Bond martini. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=295) |  You follow? It's the opposite of the James Bond martini. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=299) |  You want to be stirred, not shaken. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=305) |  So, I try to be stirred and not shaken, |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=309) |  and I use the focus in technique, that's in senior field. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=314) |  So, that helps with acting effectively, |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=320) |  but I'm not for a moment claiming that that's the totality of acting effectively, |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=326) |  but if that component isn't there, |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=330) |  then in some subtle way, and you might say, |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=333) |  well, it's so subtle it doesn't matter, |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=335) |  but I think it matters because it's qualitative, |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=338) |  it may not be quantitative, but in some subtle way, |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=341) |  I'm just part of the problem. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=345) |  I'm part of what made this. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=350) |  So, the love deeply part of doing something about the world, |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=360) |  this practice is very relevant to that. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=363) |  And the act effectively part, it's relevant also, |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=368) |  but it's not the whole picture by any means. |

     How can meditation help you love deeply? Meditation can help you love deeply. And in fact, without it, it's probably going to be very difficult to love deeply, in the sense that I'm using the term. Meditation can also help you act effectively, and there's a lot more to acting effectively than just what meditation can bring. There's many, many, many specifics. But the one thing that meditation does help, in terms of acting effectively, is it helps our actions to be motivated and directed by our emotions, as opposed to being driven and distorted.

There's surface analysis, and that's important, but for me as an individual, in that moment, the most important thing is to not forget, because it's really easy to forget, not forget deeply why this doo-doo is occurring. And deeply why this doo-doo is occurring, that this doo-doo can be any one of the gazillion things that is the litany of horrors of the 6 o'clock news.
