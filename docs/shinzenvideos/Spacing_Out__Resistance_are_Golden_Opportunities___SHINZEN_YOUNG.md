    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=0) |  Yes? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=7) |  So using that, which is how I mostly meditate, |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=12) |  usually between one of the techniques I space out. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=16) |  Often that will happen. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=18) |  And I'm not in a good place to figure out what to do next, |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=22) |  during that space out period, |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=25) |  when I realize I've spaced out. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=27) |  So what I've been doing is picking something, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=30) |  having something already set in mind that if I find a space out... |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=32) |  That's great. That's a clever strategy. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=34) |  But also, you know my standard thing, |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=36) |  as soon as you get the hint that you're spacing out, |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=41) |  if possible, what? |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=43) |  What do you do? |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=44) |  I'll give you the hint. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=48) |  S.L. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=50) |  Spoken labels. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=52) |  It's not so much a matter of I'm spaced out, |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=54) |  oh, I've got to find a new technique. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=57) |  It's I'm spaced out, |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=59) |  I've got to use my options with this technique. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=62) |  So let's continue on this, because I know that, |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=65) |  and that often comes to mind, |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=67) |  and I don't want to. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=70) |  I wish I felt stronger to work with that, |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=74) |  so usually I'll just go back to that beginning technique. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=77) |  Okay. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=78) |  So let me put a positive spin on I don't want to. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=82) |  That's my job, basically, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=86) |  is to show that actually everything is a window of opportunity. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=90) |  The I don't want to. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=95) |  What's positive about the I just don't want to? |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=101) |  Resistant thing. Okay. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=103) |  Well, you're spacing out, right? |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=106) |  It means that the concentration isn't good. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=109) |  It means that the attention is being scattered, |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=112) |  and we want to gradually train ourselves |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=115) |  so that our attention isn't scattered. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=119) |  But what's difficult is that what's scattering attention is not tangible. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=125) |  There's an intangible force that is scattering your attention, |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=130) |  and you're at the mercy of it as long as it's intangible. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=134) |  Now, here's why the I just don't want to use spoken labels |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=140) |  is a window of opportunity, |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=143) |  because if you do speak the labels, |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=148) |  you're going to not feel good in subjective space. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=153) |  The speaking of the labels is going to be uncomfortable. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=157) |  That's why you don't want to do it, |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=159) |  and forcing yourself to do it will make you uncomfortable. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=165) |  Why is that good? |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=167) |  Because the invisible forces that were controlling you |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=171) |  now have come up as tangible sensations in the body that are penetratable. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=179) |  Okay? |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=180) |  And so you go to focus in or focus on feel, feel in, |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=186) |  and you force yourself to do the spoken labels, |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=189) |  and you apply it to how uncomfortable you are speaking the labels. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=195) |  And that then allows you to work through those forces in a tangible way. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=201) |  So I wasn't being facetious or cavalier when I said that actually |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=207) |  it is actually a window of opportunity to work through the driving forces of scatteredness. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=214) |  So if you're willing to do it, |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=216) |  you're going to really develop concentration power effectively. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=220) |  If you're not willing to do it, it's petty-wise and powerful. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=223) |  You feel a little better during the set, |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=226) |  but you're not really deeply training the skills. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=230) |  So that's my little motivational spiel for SL, spoken labels. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=236) |  Yes? |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=237) |  Well, just to piggyback on that, |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=240) |  this morning I spent the first and second SID. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=245) |  I was really tired from that morning. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=247) |  And so I used labels that were mouth. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=252) |  Yeah, you used sotto voce. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=254) |  That is not nearly as difficult for me anyway to do as spoken labels, |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=259) |  and it was completely effective. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=261) |  It was really good. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=262) |  You whispered the words. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=264) |  Not even whispered. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=265) |  You sub-vocalized. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=266) |  You just moved your lips. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=267) |  Just lips. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=268) |  And so there's that, but also I have to tell you, |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=271) |  I looked through the manual, |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=272) |  and you don't have any place where you describe |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=275) |  the three different ways of labeling, |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=277) |  the four different ways of labeling. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=279) |  That's in the next edition. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=281) |  That is the biggest lacuna in there, |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=285) |  which I realized in my horror soon after we brought out this. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=289) |  What's wrong with this picture? |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=291) |  The central technique is not fully described. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=294) |  Now, there is the how to note it label on the paper, |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=303) |  but we forgot to put it into the manual. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=306) |  So, yeah, it's like the thousand pound elephant in the room. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=309) |  So I am poignantly aware of that. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=315) |  Thank you. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=318) |  Yes. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=319) |  This thing you were describing about the self-resistance |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=324) |  and you stop undying, |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=326) |  I'm not sure you understood what you're doing. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=330) |  You're stopping undying in the character. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=333) |  Well, what happens is, yes, I went through it fast, so thanks for asking. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=340) |  So we sometimes are aware of just that there are like forces driving us, |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=347) |  in our behaviors, driving us to think, driving us to talk, driving us to move. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=353) |  And it's like force. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=355) |  It's just a force that's making me do it. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=357) |  And it's intangible in the sense that I can't locate it in time and space |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=363) |  or give any quality to it other than say it's a force. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=367) |  Follow what I'm saying? |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=369) |  Nothing mysterious so far, right? |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=372) |  Okay, so how can we make these invisible, intractable forces tangible and tractable |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=381) |  so that we can actually penetrate them and work them through? |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=385) |  Well, they have to come up to, percolate up to tangibility. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=389) |  The way they percolate up to tangibility is through abstinence. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=393) |  Okay? |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=394) |  If you abstain from X, then what's been driving you to do X is going to come to the surface. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=400) |  It's going to come to the surface as image, talk, emotional body, sometimes physical body too. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=406) |  This is true for any addiction recovery situation, whether it's recovery from a substance |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=412) |  or recovery from compulsive thinking or recovery from life. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=421) |  The ultimate recovery program. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=424) |  Break the addiction to life and death. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=428) |  It's called liberation. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=430) |  But the same is true, okay? |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=432) |  The same principle holds. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=434) |  You have to abstain in order for what's been driving it to come up and be tangible as image, talk, body. |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=444) |  Okay? |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=446) |  So when that happens, now you can apply a technique. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=449) |  So the situation that Pam was describing is, well, I space out. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=455) |  And that's a habit. |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=458) |  I space out. |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=460) |  And I know that I should go to the spoken labels, but I don't want to do it. |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=466) |  So that's another habit. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=468) |  Not wanting to do the spoken labels. |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=470) |  So what I said is, well, let me put a positive spin on that situation. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=475) |  If you force yourself, if you abstain from not speaking the labels, okay? |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=481) |  So in this case, it's a do the behavior thing. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=484) |  If you do that behavior, you're going to feel uncomfortable. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=487) |  Well, we don't want to feel uncomfortable in general, but actually in this case we do. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=492) |  Because whatever comes up in image, talk, and emotional body of I hate this, or, you know, you get bang here, bang here, bang here. |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=500) |  That represents the forces that were driving those behaviors. |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=505) |  But now those forces are not invisible forces. |
    | [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=508) |  They're tangible sensations. |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=511) |  They're tangible visual, auditory, and somatic experiences. |
    | [00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=515) |  Well, what is tangible can be quantumized and can be experienced completely, can be penetrated. |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=522) |  Therefore, what is tangible is trackable, meaning that we can apply a mindfulness technique to it. |
    | [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=538) |  Things are intangible, they're not trackable, okay? |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=542) |  So there's little we can do other than white knuckle. |
    | [00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=546) |  But what is tangible is trackable, meaning you can note it. |
    | [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=555) |  What is trackable is tractable, means you can get a handle on it. |
    | [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=561) |  So that's the mechanism that I was describing with regards to why you, what's going to happen if you force yourself to speak the labels and why that's a good thing kind of thing. |
    | [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=574) |  So that's the same as stopping at a dime? |
    | [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=577) |  It's very related. |
    | [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=578) |  Because when you stop on a dime in daily life, then the juices that have been stirred up by life come up with a vengeance very quickly. |
    | [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=592) |  And if you can be Johnny on the spot with it, you can actually meditate retroactively. |
    | [00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=602) |  You say, well, I thought that's against the rules. You can't do that. |
    | [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=607) |  Let's say that you're bopping around in the world and you're just like a whirling dervish and you're going here, going there. |
    | [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=615) |  No techniques, no awareness. |
    | [00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=617) |  And I'm going to really face what's been stirred up. In that ten minutes, if you really bring your A game, you can retroactively process all those hours of unconscious freneticness. |
    | [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=644) |  And that's the rhythm of the Zen day. Unlike a vipassana training day, the Zen day is run around like crazy, stop on a dime. |
    | [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=656) |  Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. |
    | [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=658) |  At least Rinzai Zen. Soto Zen not so much. But Rinzai Zen, absolutely. |
    | [00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=662) |  Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. All day. |
    | [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=668) |  Now that's either going to make you just frenetic as hell or you're going to learn what I just said. |
    | [00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=675) |  Which is like when you're running around like crazy and then you stop on a dime, you can process all that crazy very, very quickly. |
    | [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=685) |  So yes, it's related. |
    | [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=688) |  It sounds like a version of asceticism. |
    | [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=691) |  Well asceticism is a generic term. So there are many facets to asceticism. That could be one of them, yes. |
    | [00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=705) |  Well when I was running my restaurants, I would every hour go out and sit on the bench in front of the restaurant, the bus stop bench, for five minutes. And I found the great advantage of that, stopping like that, is that then at the end of the day you haven't built up a whole lot of samskaras. |
    | [00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=727) |  You periodically let go of them so that you're much calmer at the end of the day. |
    | [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=733) |  That's my peppering. |
    | [00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=736) |  That's a great specific example. |

=== "Text"
     Yes? So using that, which is how I mostly meditate, usually between one of the techniques I space out. Often that will happen. And I'm not in a good place to figure out what to do next, during that space out period, when I realize I've spaced out. So what I've been doing is picking something, having something already set in mind that if I find a space out... That's great. That's a clever strategy. But also, you know my standard thing, as soon as you get the hint that you're spacing out, if possible, what? What do you do? I'll give you the hint. S.L. Spoken labels. It's not so much a matter of I'm spaced out, oh, I've got to find a new technique. It's I'm spaced out, I've got to use my options with this technique. So let's continue on this, because I know that, and that often comes to mind, and I don't want to. I wish I felt stronger to work with that, so usually I'll just go back to that beginning technique. Okay. So let me put a positive spin on I don't want to. That's my job, basically, is to show that actually everything is a window of opportunity. The I don't want to. What's positive about the I just don't want to? Resistant thing. Okay. Well, you're spacing out, right? It means that the concentration isn't good. It means that the attention is being scattered, and we want to gradually train ourselves so that our attention isn't scattered. But what's difficult is that what's scattering attention is not tangible. There's an intangible force that is scattering your attention, and you're at the mercy of it as long as it's intangible. Now, here's why the I just don't want to use spoken labels is a window of opportunity, because if you do speak the labels, you're going to not feel good in subjective space. The speaking of the labels is going to be uncomfortable. That's why you don't want to do it, and forcing yourself to do it will make you uncomfortable. Why is that good? Because the invisible forces that were controlling you now have come up as tangible sensations in the body that are penetratable. Okay? And so you go to focus in or focus on feel, feel in, and you force yourself to do the spoken labels, and you apply it to how uncomfortable you are speaking the labels. And that then allows you to work through those forces in a tangible way. So I wasn't being facetious or cavalier when I said that actually it is actually a window of opportunity to work through the driving forces of scatteredness. So if you're willing to do it, you're going to really develop concentration power effectively. If you're not willing to do it, it's petty-wise and powerful. You feel a little better during the set, but you're not really deeply training the skills. So that's my little motivational spiel for SL, spoken labels. Yes? Well, just to piggyback on that, this morning I spent the first and second SID. I was really tired from that morning. And so I used labels that were mouth. Yeah, you used sotto voce. That is not nearly as difficult for me anyway to do as spoken labels, and it was completely effective. It was really good. You whispered the words. Not even whispered. You sub-vocalized. You just moved your lips. Just lips. And so there's that, but also I have to tell you, I looked through the manual, and you don't have any place where you describe the three different ways of labeling, the four different ways of labeling. That's in the next edition. That is the biggest lacuna in there, which I realized in my horror soon after we brought out this. What's wrong with this picture? The central technique is not fully described. Now, there is the how to note it label on the paper, but we forgot to put it into the manual. So, yeah, it's like the thousand pound elephant in the room. So I am poignantly aware of that. Thank you. Yes. This thing you were describing about the self-resistance and you stop undying, I'm not sure you understood what you're doing. You're stopping undying in the character. Well, what happens is, yes, I went through it fast, so thanks for asking. So we sometimes are aware of just that there are like forces driving us, in our behaviors, driving us to think, driving us to talk, driving us to move. And it's like force. It's just a force that's making me do it. And it's intangible in the sense that I can't locate it in time and space or give any quality to it other than say it's a force. Follow what I'm saying? Nothing mysterious so far, right? Okay, so how can we make these invisible, intractable forces tangible and tractable so that we can actually penetrate them and work them through? Well, they have to come up to, percolate up to tangibility. The way they percolate up to tangibility is through abstinence. Okay? If you abstain from X, then what's been driving you to do X is going to come to the surface. It's going to come to the surface as image, talk, emotional body, sometimes physical body too. This is true for any addiction recovery situation, whether it's recovery from a substance or recovery from compulsive thinking or recovery from life. The ultimate recovery program. Break the addiction to life and death. It's called liberation. But the same is true, okay? The same principle holds. You have to abstain in order for what's been driving it to come up and be tangible as image, talk, body. Okay? So when that happens, now you can apply a technique. So the situation that Pam was describing is, well, I space out. And that's a habit. I space out. And I know that I should go to the spoken labels, but I don't want to do it. So that's another habit. Not wanting to do the spoken labels. So what I said is, well, let me put a positive spin on that situation. If you force yourself, if you abstain from not speaking the labels, okay? So in this case, it's a do the behavior thing. If you do that behavior, you're going to feel uncomfortable. Well, we don't want to feel uncomfortable in general, but actually in this case we do. Because whatever comes up in image, talk, and emotional body of I hate this, or, you know, you get bang here, bang here, bang here. That represents the forces that were driving those behaviors. But now those forces are not invisible forces. They're tangible sensations. They're tangible visual, auditory, and somatic experiences. Well, what is tangible can be quantumized and can be experienced completely, can be penetrated. Therefore, what is tangible is trackable, meaning that we can apply a mindfulness technique to it. Things are intangible, they're not trackable, okay? So there's little we can do other than white knuckle. But what is tangible is trackable, meaning you can note it. What is trackable is tractable, means you can get a handle on it. So that's the mechanism that I was describing with regards to why you, what's going to happen if you force yourself to speak the labels and why that's a good thing kind of thing. So that's the same as stopping at a dime? It's very related. Because when you stop on a dime in daily life, then the juices that have been stirred up by life come up with a vengeance very quickly. And if you can be Johnny on the spot with it, you can actually meditate retroactively. You say, well, I thought that's against the rules. You can't do that.
