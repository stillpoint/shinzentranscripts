    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=0) |  Most people, at least occasionally in their life, have had the experience of just sort |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=14) |  of starting to flap their lips and magically something self-organized. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=21) |  I call that auto-speak. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=25) |  So I wondered, is there a way to sort of train people so that that's more likely to happen |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=32) |  in their daily life? |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=34) |  So one way to do that is through a process that I call auto-chant. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=40) |  You take something that you're very familiar with. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=43) |  Some people use mantras or scriptures, but it can be anything that you're thoroughly |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=50) |  familiar with, and you chant it out loud, and you just sort of let your speech organs |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=55) |  self-organize. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=57) |  So it's the auditory analog of the auto-walk. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=63) |  Now we want techniques that we can use in a secular context, say in a clinical medical |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=70) |  situation or in a school, so we won't encourage people to use things that are explicitly religious |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=78) |  or from a foreign culture when we go into these mainstream situations. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=86) |  But I mean, if you belong to a certain religion or like a certain culture, you can chant things |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=91) |  like Om Namah Shivaya or Om Mani Padme Hum or Pater Noster, Ave Maria, whatever appeals |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=104) |  to you. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=105) |  But in a secular context, I like to use something simple, so maybe numbers. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=111) |  So here's auto-chant by the numbers. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=115) |  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=122) |  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=127) |  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=131) |  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=134) |  And I'm sort of tuning in to the fact that there's just air blowing across my teeth and |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=141) |  tissues are flapping and they sort of know what to do. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=145) |  And it's fun. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=148) |  I should say that in some religious traditions, they have what's called glossolalia. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=155) |  And by the way, that's not just in charismatic Christian things in North America. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=161) |  There are analogs of that in other cultures. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=164) |  I saw it in Japan at Mount Koya, for example. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=169) |  And something like that happens in subud, which is in an Islamic context in Indonesia. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=178) |  This is what's called speaking in tongues. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=181) |  Now what's significant about the glossolalia or speaking in tongues is it's auto. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=189) |  So actually, they're right. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=190) |  It is sort of the spirit. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=192) |  Now sometimes there's a belief that they're actually speaking grammatical human languages |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=198) |  like Aramaic or what have you. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=203) |  Unfortunately, that is apparently not the case. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=210) |  So the content may not actually be human speech, but the contour is truly the spirit. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=217) |  So there's a validity to that, and it can be honored as that. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=223) |  So that's auto speak. |

     Most people, at least occasionally in their life, have had the experience of just sort of starting to flap their lips and magically something self-organized. I call that auto-speak. So I wondered, is there a way to sort of train people so that that's more likely to happen in their daily life? So one way to do that is through a process that I call auto-chant. You take something that you're very familiar with. Some people use mantras or scriptures, but it can be anything that you're thoroughly familiar with, and you chant it out loud, and you just sort of let your speech organs self-organize. So it's the auditory analog of the auto-walk. Now we want techniques that we can use in a secular context, say in a clinical medical situation or in a school, so we won't encourage people to use things that are explicitly religious or from a foreign culture when we go into these mainstream situations.

But in a secular context, I like to use something simple, so maybe numbers. So here's auto-chant by the numbers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
