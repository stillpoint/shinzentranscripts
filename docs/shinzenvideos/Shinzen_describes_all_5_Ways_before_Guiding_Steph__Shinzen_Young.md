    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=0) |  OK, now, if I say I am stressed, I'm stressed, I've got my mind is spinning, |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=15) |  and I would like to be able to use some of your meditation techniques |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=22) |  to just help me in like 5 or 10 minutes. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=25) |  Is there something that I could do to, like, this program sounds wonderful, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=30) |  like a great support in the long run, and you talked about this daily practice, |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=34) |  but what's something I can do, like, right now that would just help my stress level? |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=41) |  You mean like literally right now? |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=43) |  Yes, literally right now, this instant. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=46) |  OK. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=47) |  Is there something I could do? |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=48) |  Yes, I will guide you in a practice. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=52) |  OK. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=53) |  So, for that, I'd like you to... |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=55) |  What do I do? |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=56) |  Well, you sit up. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=57) |  OK. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=58) |  Does it matter how my hands go? |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=59) |  No, just comfortable, whatever. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=62) |  Lengthen your spine. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=63) |  OK. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=64) |  Let your whole body settle. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=65) |  Close your eyes. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=68) |  And I'm going to briefly describe some options as to how we can work, |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=76) |  and then you can choose which one you want to do, OK? |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=79) |  OK. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=80) |  So, one thing that we can do, I'll go through a brief description of the five ways, |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=87) |  and then I'll let you choose. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=88) |  Are my eyes still closed? |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=89) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=90) |  OK. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=91) |  You can keep your eyes closed and just sort of be settling in |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=94) |  and sort of digest the information I give you, |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=99) |  and then you can choose which of the focusing methods you want to do. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=103) |  OK. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=104) |  So, one of the ways is focus in, and that involves observing your thoughts and emotions |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=116) |  by dividing your subjective experience into feel, image, talk. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=122) |  So that's emotional body sensation, mental picture, and auditory thoughts, self-talk, that kind of thing. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=130) |  So one of the methods we can use is to break your emotional and, in general, your subjective experience, |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=138) |  your thoughts, your feelings, your reactions, and such. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=143) |  We can break them into manageable pieces. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=145) |  It's sort of like divide and conquer. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=149) |  So that's focus in, working with your subjective experience. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=153) |  Alternatively, we can explore the power of now by doing the opposite, |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=159) |  letting go of feel, image, talk, and anchoring yourself in external sights, external sounds, |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=167) |  and physical-type body sensations, touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=171) |  So that's always the present. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=173) |  Feel, image, talk might be memory, plan, fantasy, but touch, sight, sound are always now. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=180) |  You've probably heard of the power of now. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=182) |  So that's one way to experience, in a tangible way, the power of now, is by focusing out on touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=190) |  So that's two possibilities, focus in, feel, image, talk, focus out, touch, sight, sound. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=196) |  Another possibility we talked about earlier is focus on restful states to sort of cool out. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=201) |  Another possibility is to focus on how things constantly change, the dynamic side of experience, |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=208) |  how things flow and vanish. We'll call that focus on change. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=213) |  So you can focus in, focus out, focus on rest, focus on change. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=218) |  Or the final possibility is that you can intentionally cultivate positive states of thought and emotion. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=227) |  So instead of just observing feel, image, talk, you can proactively create positive feel, image, or talk, |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=235) |  and then sort of radiate that positivity, sort of the power of positive thinking kind of thing. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=240) |  We'll call that focus on positives. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=242) |  So those are the five ways, they're fundamentally contrasting strategies. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=248) |  And I'd like you to choose if you'd like to focus in, focus out, focus on rest, focus on change, or focus on positives. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=257) |  And then I'll guide you in that regard. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=260) |  All of those could be good for working with stress. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=263) |  Each in a different way. |
