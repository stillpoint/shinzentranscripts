     So I've been thinking about this retreat I'm leading. It's only a little three to five day retreat in August 17th and 21st and it's about dismantling stress with mindfulness. And so as I'm sitting here doing my techniques I can't help but think of what I want to share with people. Oh, that would be so much fun. So I didn't intend to do it till after I got back but I've had time to read books and listen to other people's meditations and practice. Isn't that pretty? Oh look at that. It's so nice here. I'm looking forward to presenting a retreat right after having two weeks too. I'm glad about that.
