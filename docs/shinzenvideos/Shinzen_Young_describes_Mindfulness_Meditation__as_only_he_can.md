    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=0) |  Meditation and the Other |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=5) |  The way you teach meditation is different than how other people teach. |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=11) |  Right now, you've said things that I've not heard from other teachers |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=14) |  about focusing on all these different places. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=17) |  I've heard people talk about focusing on the breath |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=20) |  and a few things that I said before, |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=22) |  but you've now brought up all these different objects of meditation. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=25) |  Is that how what you teach is different than what others teach? |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=29) |  If I were to describe... |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=31) |  I think first I'd want to emphasize how what I teach |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=34) |  is similar to what the other people teach. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=38) |  But of course, there's lumpers and there's splitters, right? |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=42) |  The world is expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=44) |  Am I asking you to split or lump? |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=46) |  Well, you asked me to split, |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=48) |  but I would prefer to initially lump, and then I'll split. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=54) |  So I would say that... |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=61) |  Well, I teach people to elevate their base level of concentration. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=65) |  So from that perspective, |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=68) |  I would be identical to any other competent meditation teacher. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=74) |  I work within the mindfulness tradition. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=77) |  Mindfulness can be called a kind of meditation, if you want to, |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=82) |  in that one of the things that it does |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=85) |  is dramatically elevate your base level of concentration. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=89) |  But mindfulness has two other components. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=92) |  Mindful awareness has... |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=94) |  I think of mindful awareness as a threefold attentional skill set. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=101) |  So one of the components we've already talked about at some length, |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=105) |  that's your base level of concentration power, |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=108) |  which I define as the ability to focus on what is deemed relevant at any given moment. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=115) |  However, in addition to that, |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=117) |  which any form of meditation, mindful meditation, |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=122) |  or Christian Centering Prayer, or TM, |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=126) |  they would all achieve that. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=128) |  Mindfulness, in addition to that, |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=130) |  has two other components or features |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=133) |  that are strongly emphasized and are distinctive to it. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=138) |  One I call sensory clarity, |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=141) |  which you can think of as the ability to keep track |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=145) |  of the components of your sensory experience. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=148) |  For example, to make that tangible, |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=151) |  when you're having an emotional experience, |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=155) |  what part of that emotion is mental image? |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=159) |  What part of that emotion is internal talk? |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=162) |  And what part of that emotion is emotional feelings in your body? |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=168) |  To keep track of the feel-image-talk components |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=173) |  of emotion specifically and subjective experience in general, |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=179) |  that would be an example of sensory clarity. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=182) |  Or to know when you have an external sound. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=186) |  The sound is one thing, |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=188) |  but your feel-image-talk reactions to the sound are something else. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=193) |  And it's those feel-image-talk reactions |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=196) |  that create the sense of an eye listening to an it called the sound. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=201) |  To be able to keep track of what part is sound, |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=204) |  what part is my reaction, |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=206) |  what part is sight, what part is my reaction. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=209) |  Things like that are what I call sensory clarity. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=212) |  And just as we give people exercises |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=215) |  that specifically develop their concentration power, |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=219) |  we also give people exercises that develop their sensory clarity. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=224) |  So that's sort of distinctive to the mindfulness tradition. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=228) |  Then another thing that's distinctive to the mindfulness tradition |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=231) |  is a conscious development of what we call equanimity, |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=235) |  which is a little bit of a strange word. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=237) |  It's not ordinarily used. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=239) |  And in fact, that's why we use it. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=242) |  To be strange? |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=244) |  Not to create an aura of mystical schmistical, |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=248) |  but to give people a heads up, |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=250) |  hey, this is a technical term, |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=252) |  and it means something very specific, |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=254) |  and it's defined in a certain way. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=257) |  So equanimity sounds like being cooled out and detached, |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=261) |  but actually, as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition, |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=265) |  it's radical non-interference |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=269) |  with the natural flow of sensory experience. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=272) |  So if you have emotions in the body, |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=275) |  you don't push them down, |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=277) |  but you don't latch on to them inappropriately either. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=280) |  It's a sort of non-pushing and pulling, |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=283) |  a hands-off with regards to the flow of your senses, |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=287) |  which does not for a moment imply a hands-off |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=290) |  with regards to the flow of events in the world. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=293) |  You can be very proactive and even pushy |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=297) |  with regards to circumstances and conditions, |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=302) |  but equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=306) |  on the natural operation of your senses, |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=310) |  your senses defined as external sight, external sound, |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=314) |  physical type body sensations, |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=316) |  your mental images, your internal talk, |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=319) |  and your emotional body sensations. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=321) |  You let touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=325) |  expand and contract as they wish without interference. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=329) |  Let me just make sure I get that right. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=331) |  So equanimity is my experience, thoughts and feelings, |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=337) |  and body sensation, |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=339) |  and how I'm experiencing the world in terms of sight and sound. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=342) |  I'm just letting that happen and watching that kind of flow, |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=347) |  I don't know, like waves or something, |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=349) |  but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=354) |  to change things. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=355) |  Yes. In other words, as you become passive in a sense, |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=360) |  with regards to, in the sense that you're passive |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=364) |  in the sense that you don't fight yourself. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=367) |  You train, another way to look at equanimity is |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=370) |  it's training your sensory circuits not to interfere with themselves. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=375) |  So you could compare it to, |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=378) |  if your sensory experience is the engine of a car, |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=382) |  equanimity is oiling the engine |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=385) |  so the parts don't grind against each other. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=388) |  And that's being in the Tao or that's that flow that we're going for? |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=393) |  It can lead to an experience of fluidity, |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=397) |  but sometimes it can lead to an experience of solidity |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=400) |  because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=403) |  There's another TS, this is going to be TS Eliot time, |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=406) |  there's another TS Eliot line, |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=410) |  midwinter spring is its own season, |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=414) |  between melting and freezing the soul's sap quivers. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=419) |  You have to be willing to melt and freeze. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=423) |  The equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=429) |  But what equanimity does is, it's a skill. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=434) |  Yeah, so it's, another way to look at it is |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=437) |  it's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=444) |  but not to hold on to it inappropriately as it passes. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=448) |  How do you develop that skill? I'd like that one. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=451) |  Everyone would, because... |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=454) |  That's a good skill. Equanimity. Let's all have some equanimity. |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=459) |  I concur. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=461) |  And why it's a good skill is, |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=463) |  you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain, |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=466) |  it still hurts, but it doesn't bother you. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=469) |  And when you have equanimity with pleasure, |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=472) |  it not only feels good, it satisfies you. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=476) |  People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure, |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=480) |  but what they really want is to be free from pain being a problem |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=484) |  and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=488) |  And it turns out that the quality of equanimity does that. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=492) |  So when you say, yeah, I'd like... |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=494) |  It's like that joke, I'd like to have what she's having. |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=497) |  What she's having, yeah, I've heard some of that. |

     Meditation and the Other The way you teach meditation is different than how other people teach. Right now, you've said things that I've not heard from other teachers about focusing on all these different places. I've heard people talk about focusing on the breath and a few things that I said before, but you've now brought up all these different objects of meditation. Is that how what you teach is different than what others teach? If I were to describe... I think first I'd want to emphasize how what I teach is similar to what the other people teach. But of course, there's lumpers and there's splitters, right? The world is expansion and contraction. Am I asking you to split or lump? Well, you asked me to split, but I would prefer to initially lump, and then I'll split. So I would say that... Well, I teach people to elevate their base level of concentration. So from that perspective, I would be identical to any other competent meditation teacher. I work within the mindfulness tradition. Mindfulness can be called a kind of meditation, if you want to, in that one of the things that it does is dramatically elevate your base level of concentration. But mindfulness has two other components. Mindful awareness has... I think of mindful awareness as a threefold attentional skill set. So one of the components we've already talked about at some length, that's your base level of concentration power, which I define as the ability to focus on what is deemed relevant at any given moment. However, in addition to that, which any form of meditation, mindful meditation, or Christian Centering Prayer, or TM, they would all achieve that. Mindfulness, in addition to that, has two other components or features that are strongly emphasized and are distinctive to it. One I call sensory clarity, which you can think of as the ability to keep track of the components of your sensory experience. For example, to make that tangible, when you're having an emotional experience, what part of that emotion is mental image? What part of that emotion is internal talk? And what part of that emotion is emotional feelings in your body? To keep track of the feel-image-talk components of emotion specifically and subjective experience in general, that would be an example of sensory clarity. Or to know when you have an external sound. The sound is one thing, but your feel-image-talk reactions to the sound are something else. And it's those feel-image-talk reactions that create the sense of an eye listening to an it called the sound. To be able to keep track of what part is sound, what part is my reaction, what part is sight, what part is my reaction. Things like that are what I call sensory clarity. And just as we give people exercises that specifically develop their concentration power, we also give people exercises that develop their sensory clarity. So that's sort of distinctive to the mindfulness tradition. Then another thing that's distinctive to the mindfulness tradition is a conscious development of what we call equanimity, which is a little bit of a strange word. It's not ordinarily used. And in fact, that's why we use it. To be strange? Not to create an aura of mystical schmistical, but to give people a heads up, hey, this is a technical term, and it means something very specific, and it's defined in a certain way. So equanimity sounds like being cooled out and detached, but actually, as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition, it's radical non-interference with the natural flow of sensory experience. So if you have emotions in the body, you don't push them down, but you don't latch on to them inappropriately either. It's a sort of non-pushing and pulling, a hands-off with regards to the flow of your senses, which does not for a moment imply a hands-off with regards to the flow of events in the world. You can be very proactive and even pushy with regards to circumstances and conditions, but equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling on the natural operation of your senses, your senses defined as external sight, external sound, physical type body sensations, your mental images, your internal talk, and your emotional body sensations. You let touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, expand and contract as they wish without interference. Let me just make sure I get that right. So equanimity is my experience, thoughts and feelings, and body sensation, and how I'm experiencing the world in terms of sight and sound. I'm just letting that happen and watching that kind of flow, I don't know, like waves or something, but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world to change things. Yes. In other words, as you become passive in a sense, with regards to, in the sense that you're passive in the sense that you don't fight yourself. You train, another way to look at equanimity is it's training your sensory circuits not to interfere with themselves. So you could compare it to, if your sensory experience is the engine of a car, equanimity is oiling the engine so the parts don't grind against each other. And that's being in the Tao or that's that flow that we're going for? It can lead to an experience of fluidity, but sometimes it can lead to an experience of solidity because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. There's another TS, this is going to be TS Eliot time, there's another TS Eliot line, midwinter spring is its own season, between melting and freezing the soul's sap quivers. You have to be willing to melt and freeze. The equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take. But what equanimity does is, it's a skill. Yeah, so it's, another way to look at it is it's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises, but not to hold on to it inappropriately as it passes. How do you develop that skill? I'd like that one. Everyone would, because... That's a good skill. Equanimity. Let's all have some equanimity. I concur. And why it's a good skill is, you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain, it still hurts, but it doesn't bother you. And when you have equanimity with pleasure, it not only feels good, it satisfies you. People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure, but what they really want is to be free from pain being a problem and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction. And it turns out that the quality of equanimity does that. So when you say, yeah, I'd like... It's like that joke, I'd like to have what she's having. What she's having, yeah, I've heard some of that. That's right. The equanimity is definitely something. And how do you... Desirable. Highly desirable. In fact, more than desirable, maybe absolutely essential. If you have some physical and or emotional pain that cannot be gotten rid of by changing circumstances or by analgesia or psychotropics or whatever, then you've got a choice of either developing equanimity or being mired in abject suffering. So definitely, equanimity is not only desirable, but maybe pivotal to making life worth living under certain circumstances.
