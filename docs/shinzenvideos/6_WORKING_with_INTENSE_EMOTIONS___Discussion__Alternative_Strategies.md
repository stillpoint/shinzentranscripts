    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=0) |  I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping that line between them |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=18) |  and when I allow them to just kind of do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=25) |  the fear, a very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=32) |  of PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=35) |  So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=42) |  Yes I am. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=43) |  This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive but your facial expression |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=49) |  proves it. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=50) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=51) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=52) |  It's really interesting though because as it does I find myself wanting to comment on |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=56) |  it and I'll go off and talk and then it loses it a little bit. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=63) |  Yeah, it's got to be done purely in the body. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=67) |  Because the comments and then you know. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=71) |  It does trigger some little topics to go, this is all about it. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=75) |  That's right, but your use of practice allows you to stop that and not sort of go down in |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=79) |  that. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=80) |  Well plus there's motivation to kind of stay with this. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=85) |  It's intrinsically rewarding. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=87) |  Now next step, see if you can have the fear and the sadness dancing with and through each |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=94) |  other with your eyes open. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=97) |  And you may find defocusing the eyes initially helpful. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=106) |  So we can maintain it somewhat into a more ordinary experience. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=115) |  It's interesting when I am, as I kind of go in and out here as I do it, and I'm going |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=125) |  to talk while keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm honing in on the one |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=133) |  specific place in the body they both share in a powerful way. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=138) |  And if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's the red |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=143) |  or blue, you know, it kind of helps me maintain it with my eyes open more. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=152) |  Good. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=153) |  Now see if you can keep some contact with that even after we make some eye contact. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=162) |  It may be a little trickier. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=166) |  This is what we just did here is probably one of the missing pieces of the solution |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=178) |  to the situation that you described. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=180) |  I'm not sure it's all of the missing pieces. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=182) |  I've got a few other ideas besides this. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=188) |  But I think for this session. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=189) |  This is a good one. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=190) |  For this session, one epiphany is worth the price of admission. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=197) |  A little bit of money on the table. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=203) |  You haven't done this before, this theme of different flavors. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=207) |  Well, I remember interdigitation was a word you used to use. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=211) |  And what's so interesting is as soon as you guided me on this, I thought, I'll guide |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=216) |  somebody else in this. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=218) |  I didn't think of it for me. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=222) |  I was just too busy. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=223) |  Oh, you remember to do this. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=225) |  You remember to get the flavors to do this. |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=226) |  Oh, I'll have other people do this. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=229) |  Right, but you didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=231) |  I was just, my circuits were just so full, I guess. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=235) |  Well, you know, that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=242) |  to meditation, which is that the assumption is that when people face real challenges, |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=252) |  even people without a background in practice, if you interactively guide them, will be able |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=257) |  to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=261) |  Dramatic, positive experiences. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=266) |  It has also been my experience that people that are quite good at meditation, when they're |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=272) |  faced with real life challenges, can easily forget. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=277) |  But all you need is somebody to do this. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=279) |  And it's like, oh yeah, I knew how to do that. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=283) |  And then now you're set. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=285) |  This is one session. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=288) |  We don't need 20 years of therapy here. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=290) |  It's like, okay, now you sort of know what to do. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=293) |  So I think that's excellent. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=296) |  But I will, for subsequent sessions, remind me that I had some other ideas of, well I |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=304) |  can actually just tell you. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=305) |  Just tell me now and then I can always replay it and go, remember you had this and this. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=309) |  So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well, the two flavors have to simultaneously |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=317) |  flow and through each other. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=320) |  Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=329) |  thinking. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=330) |  And you might want to look in that direction. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=334) |  And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=339) |  exercise that, with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=345) |  I'll ask you. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=346) |  Have we ever done noting feel sources? |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=351) |  What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=357) |  If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=362) |  And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=368) |  fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=372) |  No, we haven't done that. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=374) |  We've mentioned fear, I call that noting feel sources. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=378) |  And feel can be generic or specific. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=382) |  That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=386) |  Because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering from other |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=392) |  senses that are activating the fear in real time. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=397) |  And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=403) |  How much of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates. |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=408) |  Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=418) |  But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, specifically |
    | [00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=425) |  what's triggering what. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=427) |  And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=433) |  or emotion in general, but especially fear, literally a few minutes of noting what is |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=441) |  triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=448) |  So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=455) |  fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=461) |  stuff. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=462) |  The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=467) |  talk space, no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=474) |  in the body. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=475) |  Now you know that the subconscious mind... |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=476) |  I'm quite aware of having that. |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=478) |  Yeah, the subconscious. |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=479) |  Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to know |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=486) |  did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, because it's |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=491) |  got to be one of those five, that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=501) |  reduces the overwhelm. |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=503) |  So when you're doing that, you're zooming out, for example, and for me I'm less aware, |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=511) |  I can tell when I've gone to image space, but I'm not seeing tangible image at this |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=517) |  time. |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=518) |  And I'm aware of talk. |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=519) |  That is a sign of subliminal and hence highly significant activity. |
    | [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=525) |  And I'm aware of that with talk, and with talk I can hear a little more of a rumble, |
    | [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=529) |  but I still can't. |
    | [00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=530) |  So do I have awareness equally distributed between image and talk? |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=537) |  You don't have to actually worry about how to distribute your awareness, because most |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=542) |  people discover they know as soon as you give them... |

     I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping that line between them and when I allow them to just kind of do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, a very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot.

Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, specifically what's triggering what. And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, or emotion in general, but especially fear, literally a few minutes of noting what is triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards talk space, no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear in the body. Now you know that the subconscious mind... I'm quite aware of having that. Yeah, the subconscious. Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to know did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, because it's got to be one of those five, that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly reduces the overwhelm. So when you're doing that, you're zooming out, for example, and for me I'm less aware, I can tell when I've gone to image space, but I'm not seeing tangible image at this time. And I'm aware of talk. That is a sign of subliminal and hence highly significant activity. And I'm aware of that with talk, and with talk I can hear a little more of a rumble, but I still can't. So do I have awareness equally distributed between image and talk? You don't have to actually worry about how to distribute your awareness, because most people discover they know as soon as you give them...
