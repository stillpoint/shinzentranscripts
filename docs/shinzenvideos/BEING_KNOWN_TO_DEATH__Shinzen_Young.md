    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=0) |  How about if we took everything as our object? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=7) |  Well, that's actually not that much bigger than mind-body, just sights and sounds. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=15) |  Sounds are, people usually find pretty easy. Sight, ah, that's a lot more challenging. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=22) |  But with practice you can start to sort of get a complete experience or something near a complete experience of the sights in front of you. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=35) |  And that's very rich and also very transparent. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=41) |  So it sort of seems like there's just this shaft of knowing that goes from your eyes, |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=56) |  I don't know how to describe it, it goes through the back of your head, out through your eyes, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=63) |  out to the farthest regions of the visual space and it's just like this shaft of clarity that, |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=79) |  like it bores a wormhole from void to void through the somethingness of the surrounding scene. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=87) |  Each time your eye shifts, here, here, here, here, you're actually sort of seeing the world, |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=94) |  but you're also seeing the source on, like looking in from all sides at once. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=105) |  So it's very rich and very freeing and empty sort of looking. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=117) |  It's like, and it's not so much even that you're noting, it's like you're being known by pure consciousness. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=129) |  The surrounding scene is being known. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=135) |  Known to death. |

The surrounding scene is being known. Known to death.
