    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=0) |  Okay, well, sometimes people ask, okay, when I do intellectual work, I can't meditate, |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=11) |  because I've got to do the intellectual work. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=15) |  Or is there a way I can meditate, etc.? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=18) |  I'll just share my experience. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=21) |  I think different people will have different experiences, but my experience is that when |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=26) |  I do intellectual work, when I do writing, or I'm trying to figure stuff out, I can't |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=32) |  implement any kind of formal technique. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=39) |  But what I can do is I can pepper that experience with little moments of practice in life. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=49) |  So what that involves is what I call stop on a dime, okay? |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=54) |  It's like, okay, I'm doing this, I'm doing this, I've been doing this for an hour, and |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=59) |  I really like to keep doing this, but... |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=84) |  Stop on a dime. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=100) |  Now what's going to happen? |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=102) |  Well, maybe everything will be peaceful and formless after 50 years of practice. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=111) |  Just kidding. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=113) |  But probably there will be a Vesuvius called the eruption of past and future. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=123) |  And that will erupt in the seeing, hearing, feeling, probably. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=129) |  So you implement a technique, even if it's only for 30 seconds. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=141) |  You open up completely to that. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=146) |  In those 30 seconds, if you bring the totality of your intentionality to do a quality period |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=156) |  of practice with whatever erupts, then you can actually do retroactive meditation. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=167) |  Now retroactive meditation is by definition oxymoronic, isn't it? |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=173) |  Because it's meditation, mindfulness particularly, is always in the moment, right? |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=179) |  How can you possibly retroactively be mindful? |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=183) |  But you see, while you were bopping around doing this, doing that, doing this, doing |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=187) |  that, all those energies were getting agitated, activated. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=192) |  When you stop on a dime, you only have a couple minutes. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=198) |  But if you really bring your triple A game during those couple minutes, everything that |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=207) |  got stirred up in that hour or two hours of just ordinary unconscious frenetic activity, |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=214) |  it's right there in those couple minutes. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=217) |  And if you can have a complete experience of that, it effectively has the same effect |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=226) |  on your overall growth pattern as having meditated for those two hours. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=233) |  You do it retroactively, but you have to really bring your A game to whatever got stimulated. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=238) |  So when I do things that I just have to do things, where I can't keep a technique going |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=246) |  during the thing because I'm just doing the thing, then I pepper it with this stop on |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=252) |  a dime, start on a dime. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=255) |  So stop on a dime is you stop the activity, no matter how much you want to keep doing |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=260) |  it, okay? |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=261) |  The mindfulness bell rang, I remember, okay, got to pepper the day, stop on a dime, and |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=266) |  then you start on a dime. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=268) |  Feel in, gone. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=270) |  See out. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=271) |  See out. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=272) |  Feel in, gone. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=273) |  See out. |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=274) |  Feel in, gone. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=275) |  See rest. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=277) |  See rest. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=279) |  See in, gone. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=282) |  No hesitation. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=284) |  Not, oh, I got to sit here for 15 minutes and focus on my breath and then I can note |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=291) |  what's going on. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=292) |  No. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=293) |  See out, gone. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=294) |  See out, gone. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=295) |  Feel in, gone. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=297) |  Okay? |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=298) |  Just start on a dime. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=300) |  No hesitation. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=302) |  Because as, who was that that said that? |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=311) |  Can't remember right now. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=321) |  It'll come, Victor Frankel. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=324) |  Victor Frankel said, between the stimulus and the response, there is a gap. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=334) |  Therein lies your freedom. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=337) |  In daily life, stuff comes up and about three seconds later, a reaction occurs from you. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=352) |  The degree to which there is mindfulness in that three seconds or two seconds, therein |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=361) |  is measured your freedom. |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=364) |  So we want to be able to implement these techniques instantly. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=372) |  Because in daily life, two or three seconds, if you're not Johnny on the spot with mindfulness, |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=382) |  the terrorists are in the cockpit. |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=386) |  You follow my metaphor? |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=389) |  Okay. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=390) |  The lizard brain is going to run the show. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=395) |  And then you look back and it's like, why did I do that? |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=398) |  When I could have done this other thing. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=401) |  So if you have to do actions where you just have to do the action and you can't keep a |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=408) |  technique going, that's okay. |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=411) |  But then pepper it. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=413) |  Stop on a dime. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=415) |  Stop the action. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=417) |  Occasionally start on a dime. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=420) |  Just bring your AAA game, even if it's only for two minutes, to whatever got stirred up. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=427) |  I don't know what your experience will be, but my experience is that the forces of past |
    | [00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=437) |  and future are what I have to face when I stop on a dime. |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=443) |  It's like there's this tidal force that says, look back at what just happened. |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=452) |  Look forward as to what needs to happen next. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=456) |  So there's this powerful pull of past and future. |
    | [00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=462) |  Time before and time after. |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=466) |  T.S. Eliot has a whole poem about this. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=471) |  Maybe I'll read it next time. |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=474) |  Lamenting how everyone lives in time before and time after. |
    | [00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=480) |  Almost everyone. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=482) |  Very few people live in the present. |
