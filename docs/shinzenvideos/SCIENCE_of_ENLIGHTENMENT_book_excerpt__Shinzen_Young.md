    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=12) |  Have you ever been in a situation of extreme danger |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=16) |  where time slowed down, everything got peaceful, |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=21) |  and you felt extremely focused and without fear |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=26) |  and able to respond in a remarkably effective way? |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=31) |  When I ask this question to any large group, |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=35) |  several people will always raise their hands and say yes. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=40) |  One woman described going into a state like this |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=43) |  when she almost drowned in California's Kern River. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=48) |  As the result of being so tranquil and present, |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=51) |  she avoided panic and was able to survive the incident. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=56) |  She added an interesting comment. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=59) |  If only I could have bottled that state, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=63) |  I could have addicted the world to it. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=68) |  People who have experienced this spontaneous state |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=72) |  of extraordinary focus often say |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=75) |  that it was the most meaningful day of their life |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=79) |  and that it changed them forever. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=83) |  Sometimes it happens under circumstances |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=85) |  of exceptional stress, in sports, in combat, |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=90) |  terminal illness, accident, or assault. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=94) |  But it can also happen at the opposite end of the spectrum. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=99) |  When you're extremely safe and connected, |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=101) |  say while walking in the forest alone |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=104) |  or during a particularly profound experience |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=108) |  of making love, in these circumstances, |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=112) |  you again find that time slows down, |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=116) |  your mind becomes very peaceful, and you're very present |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=120) |  and focused and unified with what's going on. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=126) |  What few people realize is that such states of presence |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=130) |  and focus are trainable. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=134) |  You don't have to wait for unusual or extreme conditions |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=137) |  in order to experience them. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=141) |  And it doesn't have to be sporadic or short-lived. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=145) |  It can be a permanent abode. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=148) |  Indeed, any person can live their day-to-day life |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=153) |  with that level of focus. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=156) |  In other words, a person's baseline of focus |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=160) |  can be elevated through systematic practice. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=165) |  The discovery that extraordinary focus can be intentionally |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=168) |  cultivated is one of the most significant findings |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=172) |  the human species has made. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=177) |  It has enormous ramifications for both our personal lives |
