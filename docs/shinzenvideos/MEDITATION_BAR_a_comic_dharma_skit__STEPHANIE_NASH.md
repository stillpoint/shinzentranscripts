    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=0) |  Lazy music playing. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=27) |  I don't know about you, but after a good retreat, there's nothing I like better than to head |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=38) |  down to my local meditation bar and throw back a few techniques. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=46) |  Maybe even take home a good procedure or two. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=49) |  There's a lot of good places around here, Purification Pub, the Hachmad Hetch, Epikey |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=58) |  Attic, Anicca Annex, and the Axis of Ego, which is too noisy for my tastes. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=66) |  Just doesn't have a good feel to it. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=69) |  Oh, and there's the Clarification Cafe. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=73) |  They got booths for eating meditation there. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=77) |  A mechanical hand comes down and stops your arm right as you lift the food. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=82) |  Then a voice comes on saying, meditate on that. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=87) |  Yeah, they got therapists in the next room for when it doesn't work out. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=94) |  My favorite place is the Vipassana Vortex. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=100) |  Used to be called Zen It Is when it was owned by this guy named Roshi, but he had a lot |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=107) |  of activity and moved on to another level of consciousness. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=112) |  The Vipassana Vortex is situated in a way that you can see right through it. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=119) |  Over the door is a color monitor running Doth in black and white. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=125) |  And something in Sanskrit or Pali or maybe it's Chinese. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=132) |  I'm told it translates a part sight, through sight, and insight. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=138) |  All fit fits welcome. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=142) |  Cho greets me at the door. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=145) |  She runs the place. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=147) |  A great dame with a solid gold heart and a smile to match. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=153) |  She says, is that a guru in your pocket or are you just happy to be here? |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=161) |  I smile and head over to the bar for a clarity cocktail. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=166) |  I got some fuzzy aspects. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=169) |  I could use a good buzz. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=173) |  The bliss bunnies are circulating and free floating throughout the room giving out labels. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=180) |  Sometimes they take you upstairs and show you a rising and falling. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=186) |  There's usually some flow there too. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=191) |  There's my friend Will. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=192) |  He's got a horse named Charlie. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=195) |  Yeah, Will's a lot like Charlie Horse, but he'll never see it. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=204) |  I see Shinzi over at his usual booth. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=206) |  He owns the place. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=208) |  You can tell his booth by the charts and graphs. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=212) |  Yeah, he's a geek and into Zen mathematics, but don't let the glasses fool you. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=220) |  He may be able to say Samadhi in a dozen languages, but he can get your sunscapes flowing better |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=227) |  than nasal spray. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=231) |  He reportedly has a bank account with the big guy with more zeros than you want to know |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=238) |  about. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=241) |  Upstairs there's also a Gawanka parlor. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=244) |  They do piercings. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=246) |  They start with the nose and are sometimes known to pierce through the whole body. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=252) |  If you're into that kind of thing. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=255) |  Back when Roshi owned the place, it was a Zen arcade. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=258) |  A lot of parlor games, learning to clap with one hand, making faces like before you were |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=264) |  born, that kind of thing. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=266) |  There was a big flower in the corner, and if you could get inside of it and get out |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=271) |  without anybody seeing you, you could get a ride on the complete experience, which is |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=279) |  no ordinary ride. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=282) |  Supposedly, it is the best thing that ever happens to you, except you can't remember |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=289) |  a thing. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=291) |  Yeah, the main Zen thing around here these days is the Merge With Us conference call, |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=298) |  and you can practice the program at home. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=301) |  Yeah, I guess you can now merge at local or long distance rates, but information is always |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=308) |  free. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=311) |  That noise? |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=313) |  Some deconstruction happening up on the third floor. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=317) |  The place is in pieces, but I hear they got rid of a lot of unnecessary crap that was |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=324) |  just gumming up the works. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=326) |  I hear the view's gonna be a lot better now. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=330) |  Oh, it's almost time for the last show. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=333) |  It's a good act. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=335) |  A singer with a dress so tight, all you can see is expansion and contraction and some |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=343) |  undulation. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=344) |  Lots of good body sensations. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=349) |  Her name is Melissa Mana. |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=352) |  Yeah, she's a bit self-absorbed, but she sings a good song. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=358) |  Sometimes the show is solid, sometimes restful, but it always flows, and before you know it, |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=365) |  it is over, gone, kaput. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=368) |  I chill with the solid, hang with the restful, and go with the flow, and when it's over, |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=376) |  nothing, nada, zero. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=379) |  But that's how it goes. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=384) |  Yeah, I'm going back to the bar for a second clarity cocktail before the show. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=390) |  I wanna get a good seat. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=393) |  It's been nice chatting with you. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=397) |  Or have I been some internal talk and mental image taking you away from being here now? |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=408) |  The only way for you to know for sure is to wake up. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=417) |  Good luck with that. |

     Lazy music playing. I don't know about you, but after a good retreat, there's nothing I like better than to head down to my local meditation bar and throw back a few techniques. Maybe even take home a good procedure or two. There's a lot of good places around here, Purification Pub, the Hachmad Hetch, Epikey Attic, Anicca Annex, and the Axis of Ego, which is too noisy for my tastes. Just doesn't have a good feel to it. Oh, and there's the Clarification Cafe. They got booths for eating meditation there. A mechanical hand comes down and stops your arm right as you lift the food.
