    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=0) |  So what we have here is a summary of self and world as three dances plus a still point. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=21) |  There's the dance of our humanity, which is our three jobs. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=27) |  Create self and world, get over the self and world, improve the self and world. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=34) |  Our tools for doing those jobs are our attentional skills, concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=44) |  Those skills are applied to and cultivated within our visual, auditory, and somatic sensory |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=53) |  experience. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=55) |  Here we have the dance of nature from the expansion, contraction, interplay implied |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=66) |  by Planck's constant at the very small level of things. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=73) |  This is the Friedman equation of cosmic density, which is the interplay of expansive matter |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=88) |  energy and contracted matter energy that determine the ultimate size and shape of the universe |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=94) |  and so forth. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=96) |  This stands for numerous structures in between the largest and the smallest that can be looked |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=105) |  upon as having expansive, contractive interplay, like a star is formed by the interplay of |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=115) |  the outwardly directed photon pressure from the heat and the inwardly directed force of |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=123) |  self-gravity. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=124) |  There are numerous scales. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=127) |  We see this. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=130) |  This is the dance of expansion, contraction, contrast within the material world or nature. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=139) |  That's reflected by mutually cancelling polarities within the mathematics of the complex number |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=149) |  field, which allows for addition. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=157) |  Scaling, which is multiplication by a real number, and twirling, which is imaginary exponentiation |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=169) |  or phaser. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=171) |  This is the stretch-squeeze aspect of generalized multiplication. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=176) |  This is the turn to the right, turn to the left, what's called a phaser, phaser aspect |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=183) |  of multiplication, which is the twirling. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=189) |  This is like a dancer that moves forward, moves backwards, stretches out, pulls in, |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=196) |  twirls to the right, twirls to the left. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=199) |  We have this abstract dance of the numbers, and we have the dance of nature itself, time, |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=213) |  space, matter, and energy. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=218) |  Then we have our senses and our sensory attention skills, which allow us to do the human dance. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=232) |  This was... |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=233) |  And in the center. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=234) |  In the center is the still point of the turning world, which is the source of all of it. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=247) |  This is a way of summarizing, in a modern way, what I would characterize as the Pythagorean |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=260) |  agenda. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=261) |  Pythagoras had this revolutionary idea. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=265) |  He lived around the same time that the Buddha did. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=269) |  I could be off by a century or so, but roughly, 5th, 6th century BC, that kind of thing. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=278) |  This revolutionary idea that the endeavor of the human soul and the nature of nature |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=293) |  and the nature of number were a single unity. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=302) |  This is a modern way to think about vindicating the Pythagorean agenda. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=320) |  Down here, it's three dances. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=327) |  What's sort of cool is that the Pythagoreans were often represented by the pentagram, the |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=338) |  five-pointed star. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=340) |  That's where this all comes from. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=348) |  This is homage to my ancestors, the Israelites. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=356) |  So we have the Greeks and the Semites. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=365) |  All these three dances. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=368) |  Three dances. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=370) |  At the still point of the turning world, neither movement from nor towards, at the still point, |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=382) |  there the dance is. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=384) |  But do not call it fixity, where past and future are gathered. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=391) |  If not for the point, the still point, there would be no dance, and there is only the dance. |
