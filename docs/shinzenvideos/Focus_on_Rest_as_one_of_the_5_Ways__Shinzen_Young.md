    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=0) |  You're talking about your background in math and science, your understanding of all the |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=9) |  comparative religion, and how your background has come and the precision of language, and |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=18) |  using everything else to create these five ways that are pulling on all this tradition. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=25) |  Can you give me an example of these five ways, or describe this to me? |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=31) |  Certain ways. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=32) |  Are these techniques, are these like five different techniques that you do? |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=37) |  That is correct. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=38) |  It's five different focus techniques, each one of which represents a modern secular version |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=45) |  of something that somebody innovated in the past within a tradition. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=50) |  Does this have to deal with what you're focusing on that you talked about earlier? |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=54) |  That's correct. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=55) |  Is each one of these focusing on something else? |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=58) |  Essentially, yes. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=60) |  Oh, okay. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=62) |  Can you just give me an example of what these... |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=65) |  Certainly. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=66) |  What you're focusing on here? |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=70) |  One of the strong influences is from early Buddhism. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=77) |  In early Buddhism, they had practices that involved attaining states of deep tranquility. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=88) |  Those are sometimes referred to as absorption practices. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=92) |  Other words are used, jhana, J-H-A-N-A, and so forth. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=97) |  The idea there was to create a positive feedback loop. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=102) |  You focus on a pleasant, restful experience. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=106) |  The more you focus on it, the more pleasant it is, motivating you to focus more. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=111) |  That creates a positive feedback loop that revs up your concentration power. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=117) |  I've taken and I've reworked that system into a technique that I call focus on rest. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=126) |  Most people, when they think about the word meditation, they probably don't think about |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=131) |  concentration power. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=133) |  They probably think of something that's going to cool me out. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=138) |  Well, that's... |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=139) |  Stress reduction. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=140) |  I was going to say, I'm stressed or the mind's spinning. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=145) |  You're just saying focus on rest. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=146) |  To me, that's like saying I'm going to go to sleep. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=151) |  How do you keep people from going to sleep if you're focusing on something restful? |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=155) |  Just take a nap. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=158) |  Very good point. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=160) |  Remember I said that I've taken these innovations from the past and I put them on a uniform |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=166) |  footing within the framework of mindfulness. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=169) |  Now, you'll remember I defined mindful awareness as a threefold attentional skill set consisting |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=175) |  of concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=179) |  Let's see how we can have an experience that is very blissful, tranquilizing, and would |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=188) |  be a stress reduction, cool out, mellow out, feel good kind of practice. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=195) |  How we can have that as a builder of concentration, clarity, equanimity. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=199) |  Here's how we do it. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=200) |  I teach people how to detect, create, and focus on six distinct sensory flavors of rest. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=211) |  Of course, I don't teach them all at once. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=214) |  I teach it one at a time so you learn them gradually. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=218) |  One is physical relaxation. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=221) |  Another is to find a blank mental screen. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=225) |  Another one is quiet in your head, mental quiet. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=230) |  What if I never have quiet in my head? |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=232) |  Then just focus on one of the other ones. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=234) |  That's why I give you six. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=235) |  Oh, okay. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=236) |  Sounds good. |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=237) |  There's a high probability that you'll be able to find, create, deepen, and enjoy at |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=242) |  least one of those six. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=243) |  So it's a numbers game. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=245) |  Sounds good. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=246) |  Maybe you can't have quiet but you can have relaxation. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=249) |  Maybe you can't have emotional peace but you can find the blank mental screen. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=253) |  So I like to give people a number of options so we find, number one, what they relate to, |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=261) |  and number two, what they find pleasant and interesting and natural and works. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=268) |  So I teach you how to find, create certain pleasant restful states. |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=276) |  When your attention wanders, you bring your attention back. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=279) |  That's developing your concentration piece. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=283) |  The restful states... |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=284) |  Even if it's focusing on relaxation in the body. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=287) |  That's the focus. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=288) |  So if my mind goes somewhere, I just bring it back to the relaxation in my body and then |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=292) |  I'm increasing my concentration? |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=295) |  Absolutely, because you can develop your concentration with any sensory experience, any experience |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=300) |  whatsoever. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=301) |  That seems like a good way to go. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=303) |  Well, that was the idea behind the absorption practices, that you find these natural, pleasant |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=312) |  experiences so you're motivated to keep coming back and it creates that positive feedback. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=319) |  So your attention wanders, you come back to the pleasant restful experience. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=327) |  Wanders again, you come back. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=329) |  The more you focus, the better you feel. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=330) |  The better you feel, the more you want to focus. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=334) |  Certainly this is going to rev up your concentration power. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=338) |  The restful states like relaxation, peace, emotional peace, quiet, or defocusing your |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=350) |  eyes, your external gaze, you can defocus. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=353) |  That produces a kind of God's felt, as they say in perceptual psychology. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=358) |  That produces alpha waves automatically. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=361) |  Anyway, the restful states tend to open you so that they create an environment where equanimity |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=371) |  is likely to happen. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=372) |  You'll be less fighting with whatever's coming up. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=378) |  So they induce equanimity. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=382) |  The other thing is, I teach you not just to cool out and mellow out, but to distinguish |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=390) |  up to six distinct flavors of rest. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxZYN-Z2-I&t=394) |  God's sensory clarity. |

     You're talking about your background in math and science, your understanding of all the comparative religion, and how your background has come and the precision of language, and using everything else to create these five ways that are pulling on all this tradition. Can you give me an example of these five ways, or describe this to me? Certain ways. Are these techniques, are these like five different techniques that you do? That is correct.
