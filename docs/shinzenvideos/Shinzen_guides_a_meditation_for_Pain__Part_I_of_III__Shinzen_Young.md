    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=0) |  I'm Shinzen Yang, and this is? |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=9) |  My name is Richard Ford. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=12) |  And I'm going to demonstrate how to interactively guide a person in working with the issue of |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=22) |  physical discomfort. Richard, would you, or you prefer Rich? |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=27) |  Yeah, Rich. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=28) |  Rich, would you say something about what you're experiencing now in terms of physical discomfort, |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=35) |  pain and so forth? |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=37) |  Well, the physical discomfort is in the lower back, both sides, extends down to the hip |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=42) |  on the right side. And then occasionally it's shoulder stiffness, and I think it's associated |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=48) |  with the back pain in the lower back. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=52) |  And is this a condition that's with you, like, most of the time? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=57) |  It's been on and off for 20-something years. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=59) |  I see. So it's a long-standing condition. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=62) |  Yes. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=63) |  Is it something that represents a major impediment in your life, or more just sort of an inconvenience? |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=72) |  It's an inconvenience, but it has been a major impediment. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=74) |  So it sometimes flares and becomes worse, and then other times it's not so severe. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=81) |  Okay. What we're going to do is I'm going to just start guiding you, and you can just |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=88) |  follow along, and we'll see where it takes us. So I'd like you to start by closing your |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=95) |  eyes, and you can sort of lengthen your spine and settle into your posture. Okay, good. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=102) |  Now, do you feel pretty settled into the posture? |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=112) |  Yes. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=113) |  Okay, good. We'll call the areas where you feel the discomfort clearly the primary areas, |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=120) |  and I'd like you to focus for a moment on those primary areas, and get a sense of the |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=127) |  size, shape, position, and so forth. Able to do that? |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=155) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=156) |  And is it one connected area, or is it several disconnected areas that are the primary? |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=164) |  Two areas. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=165) |  Two independent areas? |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=167) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=167) |  Okay, good. Now, I'd like you to check out and see if the physical discomfort in your |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=175) |  body is limited to those two primaries, or whether the primary areas in some way affect |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=182) |  the rest of your body. You can do a sort of conceptual experiment. You can imagine if |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=191) |  there was not that primary discomfort, would the rest of your body be in some way more |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=197) |  comfortable? If so, then that represents a spread of influence from the primaries. But |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=204) |  if that's not the case, then they're truly isolated, and there's no secondary spread. |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=212) |  Can you make a guess as to whether... |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=215) |  It's a spread. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=216) |  There's a subtle spread. Does it affect much of your body, most of your body, or the spread |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=224) |  is not too wide? |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=227) |  Most of it. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=228) |  Okay. That is, by the way, excellent spatial resolution. Very often, when a person has |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=236) |  a discomfort in their body, most of the suffering will be in the subtle spread. People tend |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=244) |  to think it's in the local intensity, and sometimes it can be, but subtle is significant, |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=249) |  I often say, and the subtle spread, the fact that you can detect that subtle spread is |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=254) |  highly significant. So that's excellent. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=259) |  So here's what I'd like you to do. I would like you to work with the, not with the primary |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=266) |  initially, but with the subtle spread. We're going to work with the easier material first. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=272) |  And I'd like you to let your attention freely float within the secondary sensations, and |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=279) |  to just sort of note the part of your body, like knee, face, arms, that kind of thing, |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=286) |  where there's secondary discomfort. And because that secondary discomfort is mild relative |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=293) |  to the primary discomfort, you may be able to have perfect equanimity with it, just totally |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=300) |  accept it. You may not be able to totally accept the primary sensation, but you may |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=305) |  be able to totally accept the secondary sensations, because they're milder. Does that make sense? |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=310) |  Yes, it does. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=311) |  So I'm going to have you do that with spoken labels. I'd like you to do that now. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=323) |  Spoken labels. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=324) |  In other words, you'll say out loud, knee, face. You'll note, you'll let your awareness |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=330) |  freely float within the secondary sensations, go wherever they want, and just say out loud |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=336) |  where you're focusing on the secondary. And that will tend to sort of circulate through |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=341) |  your body. You'll see your awareness will just sort of naturally go from place to place |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=346) |  within the secondary. Does that make sense? |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=348) |  Yes. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=349) |  Good. I'd like you to do that with spoken labels, and I'll just listen in. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=356) |  Shoulder blades. Neck muscles. My fingers. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=371) |  Good. To make it more impersonal, a matter of fact, you can just make it really simple |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=378) |  like shoulder, finger, neck, in a sort of gentle, a matter of fact voice, so you don't |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=385) |  have to make it my or like, you make it like really simple and sort of impersonal in a |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=393) |  matter of fact. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=400) |  Shoulder blades. Forearms. Thumbs. Neck. Spine. |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=430) |  Lower back. Good. |
