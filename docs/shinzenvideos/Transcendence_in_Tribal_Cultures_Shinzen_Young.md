    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=0) |  Yes, in tribal cultures, this is interesting. Tribal cultures typically do not have a technical |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=24) |  vocabulary for these kinds of things. Typically, they do not have systematic exercises. That's |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=36) |  characteristic of literate civilizations. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=45) |  So, when these tribal cultures encounter the elaborate philosophical and technological |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=64) |  cultures of the modern world, previously there had been a tendency to sort of think of themselves |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=77) |  as being less than, because it's like, wow, all these ideas and the literate cultures |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=87) |  foster that notion. And I don't just mean imperialistic Western culture, there's also |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=95) |  imperialistic Chinese culture. I mean, it's a human thing, okay? But actually, it's exactly |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=103) |  the opposite. It's actually to the credit of those tribal cultures that they didn't |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=111) |  have techniques and didn't have concepts, in a sense. Why? Because they didn't need |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=118) |  techniques and they didn't need concepts, they actually experienced the stuff as part |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=125) |  of their daily life and as part of their rituals, their ceremonies. So, whereas the literate |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=137) |  cultures had words for things but weren't necessarily actually having experiences, the |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=145) |  tribal cultures didn't need the words or the techniques. Life and ceremony sort of |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=152) |  did it for people. So, I would say, you know, it's not elaborated like that. Yet, having |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=162) |  said that, look what's implied, we'll just take one example of a tribal situation, the |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=170) |  one I'm most familiar with, which is Native American, specifically the Lakota or Western |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=179) |  Sioux approach to things. If you sort of look at the symbolism of the ceremonies, it's |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=185) |  all about complementary polarities. The sacred object, representative sacred object is the |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=196) |  pipe. That pipe has a bowl made of earth and a stem made of wood. And they're kept separate. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=206) |  The bowl stands for Mother Earth, which is a contractive force. The stem stands for Father |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=215) |  Sky, which is an expansive force. The tree grows up to the sky. Eventually, the bowl |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=221) |  goes back into the earth, okay, to its source. So, you have these two, you're actually holding |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=230) |  in your hands the fundamental forces of the universe. And when you bring them together, |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=238) |  okay, then there's an empowering to do things. When you do the sun dance, you dance around |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=249) |  a cottonwood tree or aspen, and they're forked like that, okay. So, it's one becoming two, |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=259) |  becoming one. That's what you're looking at for four days. There's different ways that |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=269) |  people get pierced. You may have seen in movies like that movie, The Man Called Horse. By |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=276) |  the way, unlike in that movie, no one screams and cries, okay. But let's say you get pierced |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=283) |  the way it's shown in that movie. So, you get hauled up by these skewers, and you are |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=294) |  now completely at the mercy of an expansive force of the sky that's pulling your flesh |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=304) |  up, the contractive force of the earth. Those forces are totally beyond what any human mind |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=313) |  can deal with. So, you just have to surrender to that, and however long it takes for that |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=324) |  which is caught in between the fundamental forces to give, exemplified by about a square |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=334) |  inch of skin on either side, you just have to wait. At the moment when it breaks and |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=344) |  you fall to the ground is when your prayer is delivered to the source. So, this sort |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=351) |  of polarity thing is over the, symbolically it's all there. It's there in the ceremonies. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=361) |  I've heard one medicine person, when you start a sweat lodge, okay, you put five rocks in |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=372) |  the center like that. So, one medicine man said that actually the original Lakota way |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=383) |  was there was just four rocks indicating the basic, the directions, okay. And the source, |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=397) |  God, Tonka-ashila, was represented by the absence. But because people couldn't wrap |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=405) |  their mind around that, they ended up actually putting something there just to symbolize |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=411) |  that. So, I could go on and on, and I'm sorry for getting digressed, but you asked about |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=416) |  tribal cultures. I think it's there in the life, it's there in the symbolism, it's |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=422) |  there in the ceremonies. It is not as I've ever been able to see there in terms of organized |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=430) |  techniques or philosophical concepts, but as I say, I don't think that that represents |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=435) |  a less than situation. I think it represents a better than situation. They didn't need |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=441) |  that stuff. They just lived it, or at least some of them. I'm not saying all our remote |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=446) |  ancestors were like that, but is that a sufficient answer about tribal? |

     Yes, in tribal cultures, this is interesting. Tribal cultures typically do not have a technical vocabulary for these kinds of things. Typically, they do not have systematic exercises.
