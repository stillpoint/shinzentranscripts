    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=0) |  I guess for me the trick would be like, most of the time, the problem is lack of sensory |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=10) |  clarity, so most of the time the practice is separating. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=14) |  But there are those huge windows that open. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=18) |  Where the practice is unified. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=19) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=20) |  And that's the dialectic of this practice. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=24) |  It's about, that's one of the balance aspects. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=29) |  It's a dynamic balance. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=33) |  There's a place, there's a whole list of empowering distinctions. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=40) |  There's a whole list of empowering unifications. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=44) |  And there's a whole list of disempowering distinctions. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=48) |  And there are even disempowering unifications. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=50) |  Yeah, that's exactly, I get that, I totally get that. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=54) |  If you totally get that, you got a lot. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=57) |  You got, your money's worth. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=59) |  That's the beauty of it. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=60) |  Yeah, what's an example of a disempowering, what are some examples of disempowering unifications? |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=66) |  Enmeshment. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=67) |  Say what? |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=68) |  Enmeshment. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=69) |  Enmeshment. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=70) |  I mean, isn't that how we wrote off the book? |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=71) |  Coda, enmeshment, weak ego structure, what are they, borderline issues. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=84) |  And last but not least, identification with the aggressor, Patti Hurst syndrome. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=92) |  Codependency. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=94) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=95) |  So, there's this whole list of disempowering unifications, but there's also the flip side |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=103) |  of all of the above is empowering unification. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=108) |  And then there's disempowering distinctions, of which the main one is. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=114) |  My identity stops with my skin. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=119) |  That's the biggest disempowering distinction. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=125) |  Distinction between inside and outside. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=127) |  And then the distinction between material and spiritual, between form and emptiness. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=135) |  Those are all disempowering distinctions. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=138) |  So the name of the game is, or the bad news is, that most human beings are involved in |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=148) |  disempowering distinctions and disempowering unifications. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=153) |  The good news is that any human being who chooses to can flip it and with a lot of study |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=160) |  and practice come to understand empowering distinctions and empowering unifications. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=169) |  So the focus in technique is interesting, for example. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=174) |  I usually present it to you as a deconstructive technique, but it's actually also a restorative |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=182) |  technique. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=184) |  People that have these, sometimes it's called borderline or boundary problem in the sense |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=196) |  that they can't remember who they are when they're in the presence of the looming other. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=203) |  Okay, there's this diagnosis, right? |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=208) |  And I've had people that had like official psychiatric diagnosis of that weak ego structure |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=218) |  thing and the description that they gave and the description from the Diagnostic and Statistical |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=224) |  Manual was, you know, in the presence of other people, the looming other, they just can't |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=232) |  keep contact with who they are. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=235) |  Well guess what? |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=237) |  The focus in technique will allow you to do that. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=240) |  And that's what I used. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=242) |  Actually this woman had had a lifelong, big time diagnosis, you know, from a professional |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=250) |  psychiatrist. |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=251) |  And what I did is I just had her, I put just a little different spin on the focus in. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=258) |  Instead of using it to untangle the I am-ness, I had her use it to keep in contact with the |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=266) |  fact that she does have an internal life even in the presence of the looming other. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=273) |  And it's very tangible. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=275) |  And the clarity allowed her to know she had mental image, mental talk, and emotional body |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=280) |  sensations even when the looming other was present. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=283) |  And the looming other was any other human when it started. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=287) |  And so that's the sensory clarity. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=289) |  What's the concentration piece is to not lose contact with that content in the presence |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=296) |  of the looming other. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=297) |  It's just training. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=299) |  Just training. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=301) |  So that's now using the focus in, which in some ways could be thought of as breaking |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=308) |  down the small self. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=310) |  But just put a little different spin on it, it's actually empowering the ability to not |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=316) |  lose yourself when you need to have a distinction between inside and outside. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=322) |  So you've probably heard this expression, you have to have an ego before you can let |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=328) |  go of the ego, et cetera, et cetera. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=330) |  Well, I'm not sure that I would exactly formulate it that way, but I would say that there is |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=336) |  a dialectical process. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=339) |  And I drew a picture of it. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=348) |  So anyway, you know who first came up with that expression about you have to have an |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=356) |  ego before you can let go of it? |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=359) |  That was Jack Engler, who is both a mindfulness teacher and at one time was the head of psychiatry |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=368) |  at Harvard Medical School, which tells us something about the age in which we're living. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=376) |  So I told Jack this story about the woman with the whatever, and he actually immediately |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=384) |  invited me to do grand rounds at Harvard Medical School based on that whole paradigm. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=391) |  I ended up, wasn't able to go, but it's just historically interesting. |

     I guess for me the trick would be like, most of the time, the problem is lack of sensory clarity, so most of the time the practice is separating. But there are those huge windows that open. Where the practice is unified. Yes. And that's the dialectic of this practice. It's about, that's one of the balance aspects. It's a dynamic balance. There's a place, there's a whole list of empowering distinctions. There's a whole list of empowering unifications. And there's a whole list of disempowering distinctions. And there are even disempowering unifications. Yeah, that's exactly, I get that, I totally get that. If you totally get that, you got a lot. You got, your money's worth. That's the beauty of it. Yeah, what's an example of a disempowering, what are some examples of disempowering unifications? Enmeshment. Say what? Enmeshment. Enmeshment. I mean, isn't that how we wrote off the book?
