    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=0) |  Meditation on the Phone |
    | [00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=5) |  But there was something you referred to earlier on |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=9) |  in terms of teaching meditation to people on the phone. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=16) |  And that piqued my interest a bit, |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=18) |  and I wasn't sure, I don't think I've ever heard of anyone |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=22) |  teaching someone to meditate on the phone. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=25) |  So could you just tell me a little bit about what you mean there |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=29) |  and how that happens? |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=31) |  Well, I wanted to create a fully modern delivery system. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=37) |  After I had sort of reformulated the techniques |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=41) |  in terms of the five ways, which was one tier or level of creativity, |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=47) |  then I turned my attention towards the issue of, |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=51) |  well, now I've got a modernized version of the classical paths to enlightenment, |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=58) |  how do I make this easily available to people around the world? |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=63) |  And so if you think about it, traditionally what people do is |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=73) |  they do some daily practice, maybe 10, 20 minutes, |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=77) |  a half an hour a day, what have you, |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=79) |  and then they do periodic intensive retreats, |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=83) |  which typically would be a day or a weekend or a week or two weeks |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=89) |  or three months or in Tibet, three years, three months, |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=93) |  and three days in a cave, et cetera, et cetera, |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=96) |  some combination of day-to-day practice |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=99) |  plus some sort of periodic intensive practice, |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=103) |  typically done with a group, although not inevitably. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=108) |  That rhythm of practice is the standard formula. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=113) |  If you maintain something like that, |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=118) |  then the passage of time will mark the process of psycho-spirituality. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=123) |  That's the six months to... |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=125) |  When you talked about how long it takes for us to begin to see the results |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=129) |  and you said it might be six months to a year. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=131) |  Six months to a year. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=133) |  That's not including this three-month retreat thing. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=136) |  You don't have to do three months, certainly not three years. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=141) |  But I think that a person does need to do |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=145) |  some day-to-day practice on their own. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=149) |  I tell people the minimum is 10-4, |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=155) |  10 minutes most days of working on your own, |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=158) |  then at least four hours of continuous intensive retreat once a month. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=165) |  And what does that mean, four hours of... |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=169) |  No, you don't sit without moving, |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=171) |  but you have unbroken practice for four hours, |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=174) |  but you may get up and stretch and do things like that. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=178) |  So it occurred to me that most people in the world |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=184) |  are not in a position to take even four hours out to go to a center. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=191) |  They have a family situation, they have a work situation, |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=198) |  they probably don't live near a mindfulness center, |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=205) |  they can't incur the expenses, the lost wages, |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=212) |  the travel expenses, the expenses of being in a venue |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=216) |  where you have to get lodging and meals if you do residential retreats. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=221) |  So a way to make all of the features of a group residential retreat |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=230) |  available to anyone in the world and circumvent these problems |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=236) |  would be to pipe it into the individual's home in four-hour blocks. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=243) |  And that would be with a conference call. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=247) |  Is this a recording? |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=249) |  No, it's live. It's me or my facilitators live. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=255) |  So the way it works is you go to basicmindfulness.org |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=259) |  and you register for a retreat. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=264) |  The programs are always on the second weekend of the month. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=270) |  One two-hour program on Friday evening, |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=273) |  two four-hour programs on Saturday separated by an hour, |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=277) |  and then two four-hour programs on Sunday. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=280) |  So that's the second weekend of every month you know that you can plan ahead. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=284) |  Do you have to do the whole, are they sequential? |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=287) |  No, they're completely independent of each other. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=289) |  So I could just do four hours on Sunday? |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=291) |  You could do just two hours on a Friday. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=294) |  So it can be as short as two hours on Friday, |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=297) |  and it can be as long as Friday, two four-hour periods on Saturday, |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=303) |  and two four-hour periods on Sunday, |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=305) |  since you've taken the whole weekend for practice, |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=308) |  and anything in between. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=310) |  The programs are all independent. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=313) |  You register for them individually. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=316) |  And so it's sort of like dharma on demand. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=322) |  You might say you decide what you're interested in. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=326) |  But it's all unified around the five ways. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=331) |  I'm sorry, are you sitting there holding a phone to your head for eight hours? |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=335) |  No, you don't hold the phone. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=337) |  You either use a speakerphone or you get from Radio Shack a hands-free headset with a microphone. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=345) |  It costs you $20. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=347) |  You put that, replace your handset with the headset so that you've got a hands-free operation. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=353) |  If you're going to do the programs with consistency, it's worth it to buy the headset or to get a speakerphone. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=360) |  So you're sitting there, your eyes are closed, |
    | [00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=364) |  and everybody calls in to the number. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=372) |  There's from 40 to 90 people on the call, depending on various factors. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=379) |  From all over? |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=380) |  All over the world. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=382) |  All at the same time? |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=383) |  All at the same time. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=384) |  Oh, how neat is that? |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=386) |  And many of them know each other because they've been on site programs together. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=394) |  Because I also go around the country and run residential retreats, so people know each other. |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=400) |  I know who's on the call. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=401) |  Yeah, well, everybody introduces themselves. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=404) |  So you see, people thought, well, gee, it's telephone, it's going to separate people. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=410) |  But actually, we found that it very much unites people. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=413) |  It creates a virtual community of practice. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=417) |  So what happens is it starts precisely at the posted time, |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=424) |  but people typically call in 15 minutes early, and there's just free schmoozing and socializing. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=431) |  Schmoozing is important. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=432) |  Yeah, that's an ancient Sanskrit word. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=436) |  It builds community and builds a camaraderie so that when the guidance starts, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=444) |  well, I claim to take the mist out of mysticism, and I don't like things to be mystical schmistical. |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=451) |  But there are some mystical schmistical things. |
    | [00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=454) |  I can't really explain how that bonding takes place, because after all, it is just people on a phone. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=464) |  But somehow, it's like you're in the same room. |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=468) |  It's really weird. |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=470) |  Just knowing that they're there and the fact that you've had this socializing before and what have you, |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=476) |  it's like you sit really strong, and you've sensed the presence of these other people. |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=483) |  Plus, you usually have your eyes closed most of the time anyway, |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=486) |  so even if they were in the room, you'd have your eyes closed. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=489) |  Yeah, something happens that is a synergy that's more than I expected. |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=496) |  So what happens is you call in, and you choose the program you want, |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=500) |  and every month there's an intro program so that you can start up any time. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=507) |  I call it the Home Practice Program. |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=510) |  You get it off of basicmindfulness.org to register and to find out about it. |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=516) |  But the way it's set up is you can begin any month. |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=522) |  There's always a program for first-timers that's an intro to one of the five ways, |
    | [00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=531) |  and you can begin with any one of the five ways. |
    | [00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=533) |  So if I've never meditated before, once a month there's some way I can call in |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=539) |  and have someone guide me from scratch, like I have no idea what to do. |
    | [00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=543) |  Any of the programs that say Part 1, so Focus In Part 1, Focus Out Part 1, |
    | [00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=549) |  Focus on Rest, Change, and Positives. |
    | [00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=552) |  Those are the five ways? |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=553) |  Those are the five ways. |
    | [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=555) |  All the Part 1 programs require no previous experience whatsoever. |
    | [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=560) |  Great. |

     Meditation on the Phone But there was something you referred to earlier on in terms of teaching meditation to people on the phone. And that piqued my interest a bit, and I wasn't sure, I don't think I've ever heard of anyone teaching someone to meditate on the phone. So could you just tell me a little bit about what you mean there and how that happens? Well, I wanted to create a fully modern delivery system. After I had sort of reformulated the techniques in terms of the five ways, which was one tier or level of creativity, then I turned my attention towards the issue of, well, now I've got a modernized version of the classical paths to enlightenment, how do I make this easily available to people around the world? And so if you think about it, traditionally what people do is they do some daily practice, maybe 10, 20 minutes, a half an hour a day, what have you, and then they do periodic intensive retreats, which typically would be a day or a weekend or a week or two weeks or three months or in Tibet, three years, three months, and three days in a cave, et cetera, et cetera, some combination of day-to-day practice plus some sort of periodic intensive practice, typically done with a group, although not inevitably. That rhythm of practice is the standard formula. If you maintain something like that, then the passage of time will mark the process of psycho-spirituality. That's the six months to... When you talked about how long it takes for us to begin to see the results and you said it might be six months to a year. Six months to a year. That's not including this three-month retreat thing. You don't have to do three months, certainly not three years. But I think that a person does need to do some day-to-day practice on their own. I tell people the minimum is 10-4, 10 minutes most days of working on your own, then at least four hours of continuous intensive retreat once a month. And what does that mean, four hours of... No, you don't sit without moving, but you have unbroken practice for four hours, but you may get up and stretch and do things like that. So it occurred to me that most people in the world are not in a position to take even four hours out to go to a center. They have a family situation, they have a work situation, they probably don't live near a mindfulness center, they can't incur the expenses, the lost wages, the travel expenses, the expenses of being in a venue where you have to get lodging and meals if you do residential retreats. So a way to make all of the features of a group residential retreat available to anyone in the world and circumvent these problems would be to pipe it into the individual's home in four-hour blocks. And that would be with a conference call. Is this a recording? No, it's live. It's me or my facilitators live. So the way it works is you go to basicmindfulness.org and you register for a retreat. The programs are always on the second weekend of the month. One two-hour program on Friday evening, two four-hour programs on Saturday separated by an hour, and then two four-hour programs on Sunday. So that's the second weekend of every month you know that you can plan ahead. Do you have to do the whole, are they sequential? No, they're completely independent of each other. So I could just do four hours on Sunday? You could do just two hours on a Friday. So it can be as short as two hours on Friday, and it can be as long as Friday, two four-hour periods on Saturday, and two four-hour periods on Sunday, since you've taken the whole weekend for practice, and anything in between. The programs are all independent. You register for them individually. And so it's sort of like dharma on demand. You might say you decide what you're interested in. But it's all unified around the five ways. I'm sorry, are you sitting there holding a phone to your head for eight hours? No, you don't hold the phone. You either use a speakerphone or you get from Radio Shack a hands-free headset with a microphone. It costs you $20. You put that, replace your handset with the headset so that you've got a hands-free operation. If you're going to do the programs with consistency, it's worth it to buy the headset or to get a speakerphone. So you're sitting there, your eyes are closed, and everybody calls in to the number. There's from 40 to 90 people on the call, depending on various factors. From all over? All over the world. All at the same time? All at the same time. Oh, how neat is that? And many of them know each other because they've been on site programs together. Because I also go around the country and run residential retreats, so people know each other. I know who's on the call. Yeah, well, everybody introduces themselves. So you see, people thought, well, gee, it's telephone, it's going to separate people. But actually, we found that it very much unites people. It creates a virtual community of practice. So what happens is it starts precisely at the posted time, but people typically call in 15 minutes early, and there's just free schmoozing and socializing. Schmoozing is important. Yeah, that's an ancient Sanskrit word. It builds community and builds a camaraderie so that when the guidance starts, well, I claim to take the mist out of mysticism, and I don't like things to be mystical schmistical. But there are some mystical schmistical things. I can't really explain how that bonding takes place, because after all, it is just people on a phone. But somehow, it's like you're in the same room. It's really weird. Just knowing that they're there and the fact that you've had this socializing before and what have you, it's like you sit really strong, and you've sensed the presence of these other people. Plus, you usually have your eyes closed most of the time anyway, so even if they were in the room, you'd have your eyes closed. Yeah, something happens that is a synergy that's more than I expected. So what happens is you call in, and you choose the program you want, and every month there's an intro program so that you can start up any time. I call it the Home Practice Program. You get it off of basicmindfulness.org to register and to find out about it. But the way it's set up is you can begin any month. There's always a program for first-timers that's an intro to one of the five ways, and you can begin with any one of the five ways. So if I've never meditated before, once a month there's some way I can call in and have someone guide me from scratch, like I have no idea what to do. Any of the programs that say Part 1, so Focus In Part 1, Focus Out Part 1, Focus on Rest, Change, and Positives. Those are the five ways? Those are the five ways. All the Part 1 programs require no previous experience whatsoever. Great.
