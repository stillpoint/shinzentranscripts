    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=0) |  Okay, so I'm going to start off with asking you, since our first interview, which was |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=14) |  January of 2009, and we are now in January of 2010, and since then you did all these |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=22) |  interviews with Harprakash on YouTube, and you've had two whole YouTube channels now |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=27) |  full of videos of Shenzhen out in the world. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=31) |  Has this changed anything? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=32) |  Has this affected you in any way, having all this YouTube presence now? |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=36) |  It hasn't affected me personally that I'm aware of, but I think what it has done is |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=43) |  made a lot of very useful material available to a lot of people, because we seem to be |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=50) |  having people using this, and of course we have records of all the usage. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=56) |  I would say as far as me personally, the main impact has been I have a lot of very, very |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=62) |  pleasant emotional body sensation at the knowledge that, because of the service that a couple |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=70) |  of my students have done for me, yourself and Harprakash, now we've got thousands and |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=77) |  thousands of people making use of this, and most of what I have to teach is just there |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=85) |  in a very organized format, available 24-7, free to the world, Dharma on demand. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=94) |  Just gives me pleasant sensations. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=96) |  Have you heard of ways in which people may be using the videos that is helpful? |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=102) |  I wouldn't have thought of. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=103) |  There are actually ways that I wouldn't have thought of. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=106) |  I thought people would mostly be using it for conceptual reference occasionally, but |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=113) |  apparently people are using it on a consistent basis as a kind of teacher in your home for |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=120) |  their day-to-day practice. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=122) |  Got a guru in your pocket, and you're just happy to see me. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=125) |  There we go. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=126) |  Cool, cool. |
