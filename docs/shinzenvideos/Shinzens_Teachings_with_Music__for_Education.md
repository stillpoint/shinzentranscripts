    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=0) |  I understand that you have some programs that are based on your techniques that have started |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=13) |  to be employed in various places. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=15) |  And I wondered if there is something that you can share with us about what's happening |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=20) |  with aspects of your basic mindfulness. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=23) |  I know sometimes a particular focus, whether for pain or music or something like that. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=31) |  Is there something that you could share with us in terms of how your techniques are being |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=35) |  employed in maybe institutions or educationally or health facilities? |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=41) |  I think the two things that come to mind immediately are that other teachers are using my materials |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=52) |  to teach meditation, the YouTube materials. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=57) |  So they're capturing YouTube segments and using them in the curriculum. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=66) |  And I think that that's being done both for people teaching meditation pragmatically in |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=74) |  the public, but also for people teaching courses on meditation in universities or courses that |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=81) |  may be like Buddhism, Asian culture, comparative mysticism, that kind of thing, where academic |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=92) |  professors are assigning some of my YouTube segments to supplement the supplementary materials. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=103) |  So that's one area. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=108) |  Then probably the most exciting thing is the development of music-based mindfulness for |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=115) |  kids. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=117) |  And they're doing that in Portland State, and it was phenomenally successful. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=122) |  And we have Soryu's YouTube show, what we're doing in Burlington, Vermont. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=130) |  Now Soryu is in the public school system. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=133) |  First he was just in this after-school center with music-based mindfulness for kids. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=138) |  Now he's in the public schools doing mindfulness. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=142) |  And I think that's very exciting. |
