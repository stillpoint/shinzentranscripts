     Why do I do this? Why do I go off and camp when it's this has been really cold and spend 14 days alone not talking to anybody just me and the ocean and the wind and the trees and my tent. Why do I do it? There is no better restoration for me. There's something about it that's just so pure and my nervous system just unravels, unwinds, lets go and insights come. I was gonna be hard leaving. I can't believe it's been 11 days. It feels like it's been three. Time flies when you're not here. I disappear. I disappear and I disappear and become the wind and the trees and the waves and the clouds. It's not a bad way to go. you
