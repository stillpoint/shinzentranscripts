    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=0) |  So we're talking about, okay, I said, I actually contrasted spacious versus dense. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=16) |  So for me, dense just means not spacious. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=21) |  Okay? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=22) |  Now here's where it gets, where you have to be really careful about words, and this is |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=26) |  exactly the point you brought up, which I was wondering if anyone would bring up, actually. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=33) |  So good for you. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=37) |  When you get into very highly concentrated states, you can get a sense that things are |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=44) |  thickening or getting, quote, dense, but it's pleasant, and it's unifying and also liberating. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=59) |  That's contractive flow. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=61) |  That's another flavor of contractive flow, the feather-like paper. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=66) |  See expansion and contraction are technical terms. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=70) |  Oh, what about technical terms? |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=72) |  Okay, they have very specific meanings. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=75) |  Expansion and contraction in my system cover a huge range of sub-flavors. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=85) |  The lightness, thinness can be parsed as contractive. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=90) |  That jonic, sort of, quote, density could also be parsed as contractive, and they're |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=98) |  both pleasant and liberating, just in different ways. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=103) |  So that's what I have to say about that. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=105) |  Can you maybe compare and contrast the sense of heaviness and thickness, sort of, getting |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=112) |  into a certain state versus the quote, unquote, badness, the thickness in a sensory language? |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=119) |  Well, one obvious difference is that the quote, bad density hurts like hell, whereas the good |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=132) |  density really feels good. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=137) |  That's an obvious difference. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=141) |  The reason for that difference, if I were to put it in words, is that the quote, bad |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=145) |  density comes about from resisting the contractive force, whereas the quote, good density comes |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=157) |  about through deeply surrendering to the contractive force. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=161) |  There's not that subtle cellular rigidity against contraction. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=168) |  And the good density is actually halfway to global gone. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=179) |  And global gone is a big deal. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=182) |  Global gone is the ninth jhana. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=185) |  That's sit there for a week and your breath stops. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=189) |  Except you don't die. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=190) |  I mean, your breath obviously doesn't completely stop, but you know. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=195) |  That's sort of waxy catatonic physiological trance. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=201) |  That's good, if you're fortunate enough to be moving in that direction. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=206) |  So that's what I have to say about that. |

     So we're talking about, okay, I said, I actually contrasted spacious versus dense. So for me, dense just means not spacious. Okay?
