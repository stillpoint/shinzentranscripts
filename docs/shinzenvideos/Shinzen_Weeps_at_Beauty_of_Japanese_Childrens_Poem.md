    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=0) |  Because, just as you had to learn the ABCs, every Japanese child has to learn the Iroha. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=12) |  The Iroha is the traditional ordering of the Japanese script. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=21) |  Hiragana, are you aware that Japanese language is written in a combination of kanji, which |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=29) |  are Chinese characters, and kana, which are Japanese syllables, syllabary. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=37) |  There's two kinds of kana, but the one that's normally used is called Hiragana. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=44) |  The way that school children learn Hiragana is they learn a poem. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=51) |  A poem that contains each syllable of the Japanese language once and only once. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=59) |  And that poem is traditionally ascribed to Kobo Daishi, also known as Kukai. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=71) |  And Kukai was the person who introduced Shingon into Japan from China. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=78) |  And he developed his linguistic sophistication because he studied a little Sanskrit. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=89) |  And the Sanskrit, Panini and such, he was, the people in India invented grammar, really. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=99) |  The world's first scientific grammarian was Panini. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=104) |  And because Shingon uses mantras a lot, and so they wanted to know Sanskrit, so they actually |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=111) |  learned phonological principles. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=115) |  They meaning the monks, the Shingon monks. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=117) |  And they learned it based on Indic notions of linguistics. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=124) |  So there was an indirect impact all the way from India, all the way to Japan, when the |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=138) |  Japanese written language was first sort of developing in the Heian period. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=143) |  It was Shingon monks that did it because they had linguistic sophistication. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=149) |  They created the equivalent of their alphabet. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=154) |  And so whereas you learn the ABCs, a Japanese child learns this poem. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=163) |  Iro wa nioedo, chirinuru wo, wagayo tarezo tsunemaru, ui no okuyaba kyo koete, asaki yume |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=184) |  michi e mo sezu. |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=185) |  That contains each syllable of the Japanese language exactly once. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=189) |  And then you memorize that poem, and you learn the kana that way. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=194) |  And that's the direct influence of Shingon on the Japanese language, which is absolutely |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=199) |  indelible. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=202) |  Every Japanese person knows it. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=206) |  So what does the poem mean? |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=210) |  It's very interesting. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=215) |  Iro means color, Iro wa nioedo, although the colors are bright, chirinuru wo, the flower |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=227) |  will eventually fall to the ground. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=232) |  Wagayo, in this world of ours, tarezo, who, tsunemaru, can expect to live forever. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=248) |  Ui no okuyaba. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=254) |  Ui is the name of, this is really incredibly beautiful. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=258) |  Ui is the name of a place, but it's a pun also. |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=264) |  Ui no okuyaba, maybe you know what yama means in Japanese. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=268) |  What does it mean? |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=271) |  Mountain. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=272) |  Okuyama means furthest mountains. |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=275) |  So ui no okuyama kyo koete. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=282) |  Today I crossed over the furthest mountain of ui, but it's a pun because ui also means |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=293) |  sanskrita dharma, as a technical term in Buddhism. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=299) |  Sanskrita dharma is compounded things. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=304) |  You've probably heard this, okay? |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=307) |  Things that arise due to causality, anything other than nirvana is a compounded thing. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=314) |  So ui no okuyama, today, ui no okuyama kyo koete, today crossing the farthest mountain |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=323) |  of the village of ui, asaki yume miji, no longer will I be subject to superficial dreams, |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=339) |  ei mosesu, nor will I be intoxicated anymore. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=346) |  It's a whole talk about impermanence and enlightenment. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=351) |  That's how every Japanese child learns their alphabet, to this day. |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=357) |  Little if your culture. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=361) |  You don't want to know what I know. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=370) |  So ui no okuyama kyo koete, asaki yume miji, ei mosesu. |
