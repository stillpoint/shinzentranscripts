    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=0) |  It's an interesting practice to use when noticing internal talk. Whenever there's |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=7) |  internal talk and I notice it, I stop and notice what tension in the head or body |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=12) |  has happened because of that internal talk. Then I relax and release that. And |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=17) |  if there was an emotion with internal talk, I might find that and really like |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=25) |  feel it fully and then kind of open to it and release it in a certain kind of |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=31) |  way. And then that affects how strong the next talk on that topic comes, if that |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=36) |  makes sense. That's my on-the-fly purification process. This is my last |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=43) |  organic night here, I guess I'll say. Tomorrow night will be a closing |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=49) |  ceremony, so I'm just reflecting on the insights I've gotten and I feel |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=56) |  gratitude for the view. |
