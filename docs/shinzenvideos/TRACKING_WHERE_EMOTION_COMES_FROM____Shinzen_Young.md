    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=0) |  Remind me that I had some other ideas of, well I can actually just tell you. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=13) |  Just tell me now and then I can always replay it and go, remember you didn't do it. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=17) |  So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well the two flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=27) |  Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=38) |  And you might want to look in that direction. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=42) |  And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special exercise that, |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=49) |  with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but I'll ask you. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=55) |  Have we ever done noting feel sources? |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=59) |  What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=64) |  If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=70) |  And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=80) |  No, we haven't done that. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=82) |  Noted fear, I call that noting feel sources. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=86) |  And feel can be generic or specific. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=89) |  That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=94) |  Because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering from other senses that are activating the fear in real time. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=105) |  And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=111) |  It's a bunch of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=116) |  Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=126) |  But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=132) |  specifically what's triggering what. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=135) |  And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=141) |  or emotion in general, but especially fear, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=146) |  literally a few minutes of noting what is triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=156) |  So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=163) |  fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=170) |  The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards talk space, |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=177) |  no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear in the body. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=183) |  Now you know that the subconscious mind... |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=185) |  I'm quite aware of having that. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=187) |  Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to note, |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=193) |  did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=198) |  because it's got to be one of those five, |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=201) |  that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly reduces the overwhelm. |
