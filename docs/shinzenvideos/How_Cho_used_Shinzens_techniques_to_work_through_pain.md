    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=0) |  Can you give an example of maybe a specific way in which you used the techniques for any |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=19) |  specific issue? |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=21) |  Yes, I found out recently or in the last couple of years that I am either allergic to codeine |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=31) |  or it doesn't like me, whatever. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=35) |  And I was having some back issues and my doctor prescribed codeine for me in a Tylenol 3. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=43) |  And I had said to her, I don't think I can take codeine because years ago when I was |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=49) |  experiencing gallbladder problems, I started having extreme stomach issues with it. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=54) |  And she said, oh, that was probably your gallbladder. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=57) |  Well, it wasn't. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=59) |  In the middle of the night, my stomach went into an extreme spasm and I immediately started |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=67) |  doing my practice. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=69) |  It escalated and yes, it became much more difficult. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=73) |  I actually sent my husband downstairs to get a CD that was how to deal with pain or like |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=80) |  I wanted Shinsen to guide me. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=82) |  And while it was extremely difficult, I think it really, really helped. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=86) |  I spoke with him after that because even after my years of meditation, I thought I could |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=93) |  do better at it. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=95) |  But he was very kind and said, you know, until some of these really, really big issues hit |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=101) |  us, you don't know what you would have been if you didn't have the practice. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=106) |  Can you give an example of what you specifically did on that night? |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=111) |  I did two things. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=114) |  I did the focus away from the pain and I also focused on. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=119) |  I needed both. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=121) |  Shinsen's techniques, when you're focusing away, I was looking for restful spaces within |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=127) |  my body, within my talk space. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=131) |  I was focusing away from the pain by trying to find the relaxed rest spot so that the |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=139) |  pain wasn't so intense. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=141) |  And then when it would get to the point where the focus, I had to focus on it, then I was |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=146) |  using focus on the pain and I was watching the intensity, the shape, whether it was sharp |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=155) |  or dull, whether it moved, was there a color to it that I could focus on to sort of, and |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=162) |  that, you know, that allows the pain to spread more and be less intense in one area. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=170) |  That's what I did. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=174) |  I ended up going to the emergency anyway, but. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=179) |  Everything worked out. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=181) |  So, yes, it's a coding, something you just have to work out of your system. |
