    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=0) |  So, equanimity sounds like being cooled out and detached, but actually, as we would define |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=12) |  it in the mindfulness tradition, it's radical non-interference with the natural flow of |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=19) |  sensory experience. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=21) |  So if you have emotions in the body, you don't push them down, but you don't latch onto them |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=27) |  inappropriately either. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=28) |  It's a sort of non-pushing and pulling, a hands-off with regards to the flow of your |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=35) |  senses, which does not for a moment imply a hands-off with regards to the flow of events |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=41) |  in the world. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=42) |  You can be very proactive and even pushy with regards to circumstances and conditions, but |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=52) |  equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling on the natural operation of your senses. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=59) |  Your senses defined as external sight, external sound, physical type body sensations, your |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=66) |  mental images, your internal talk, and your emotional body sensations. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=70) |  You let touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, expand and contract as they wish without |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=76) |  interference. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=77) |  Let me just make sure I get that right. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=80) |  So equanimity is my experience, thoughts and feelings and body sensation and how I'm experiencing |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=89) |  the world in terms of sight and sound. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=91) |  I'm just letting that happen and watching that kind of flow, I don't know, like waves |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=97) |  or something, but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world to change |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=103) |  things. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=104) |  In other words, as you become passive in a sense with regards to, in the sense that you're |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=112) |  passive in the sense that you don't fight yourself. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=117) |  Another way to look at equanimity is it's training your sensory circuits not to interfere |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=122) |  with themselves. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=124) |  So you could compare it to if your sensory experience is the engine of a car, equanimity |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=131) |  is oiling the engine so the parts don't grind against each other. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=137) |  Being in the Dow or that's that flow that we're going for? |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=142) |  It can lead to an experience of fluidity, but sometimes it can lead to an experience |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=147) |  of solidity because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=152) |  There's another TS, this is going to be TS Eliot time, there's another TS Eliot line, |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=159) |  midwinter spring is its own season, between melting and freezing the soul's sap quivers. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=168) |  You have to be willing to melt and freeze. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=172) |  The equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take, but what equanimity |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=179) |  does is it's a skill. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=183) |  So another way to look at it is it's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=192) |  but not to hold onto it inappropriately as it passes. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=197) |  How do you develop that skill? |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=198) |  I'd like that one. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=200) |  Everyone would. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=201) |  That's a good skill. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=202) |  Equanimity, let's all have some equanimity. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=208) |  I concur. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=210) |  And why it's a good skill is you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain it |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=215) |  still hurts but it doesn't bother you. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=217) |  And when you have equanimity with pleasure it not only feels good, it satisfies you. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=225) |  People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure, but what they really |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=229) |  want is to be free from pain being a problem and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=236) |  And it turns out that the quality of equanimity does that. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=240) |  So when you say, yeah, I'd like... |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=241) |  Yeah, some of that, please. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=242) |  It's like that joke, it's like I'd like to have what she's having. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=243) |  What she's having, yeah, I agree with some of that. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=244) |  That's what I just said. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=245) |  Yeah, that's right. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=248) |  Well, the equanimity is definitely something. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=253) |  And how do you... |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=254) |  Are people desirable? |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=257) |  Highly desirable. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=258) |  And in fact, more than desirable may be absolutely essential. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=263) |  If you have some physical and or emotional pain that cannot be gotten rid of by changing |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=270) |  circumstances or by analgesia or psychotropics or whatever, then you've got a choice of either |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=279) |  developing equanimity or being mired in abject suffering. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=285) |  So definitely equanimity is not only desirable, it may be pivotal to making life worth living |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocJp_jInHI&t=292) |  under certain circumstances. |

     So, equanimity sounds like being cooled out and detached, but actually, as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition, it's radical non-interference with the natural flow of sensory experience.
