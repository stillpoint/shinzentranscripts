    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=0) |  Charlie left me a note reminding me about the old days. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=16) |  Where are you Charlie? |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=17) |  Right here. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=18) |  The really old days that he can remember and a few of you can remember. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=26) |  The really old days I had a center in Koreatown. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=34) |  We did exactly the same thing that we were doing here. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=39) |  That was 25 years ago. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=50) |  So it's downtown LA and it's a long time ago. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=55) |  We used to do exactly what we do. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=58) |  We'd sit in the New Year, every single New Year we would do that. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=63) |  Except it was a lot more dramatic than we're going to get to experience. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=71) |  Because they hadn't yet outlawed the pistoleros. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=79) |  I think it's now illegal, right, to shoot off firearms in LA? |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=85) |  They still do it. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=87) |  Well, it wasn't even illegal. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=88) |  It wasn't even discouraged. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=89) |  We were right in the heart of downtown LA. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=97) |  So what would happen is – yeah, I'd forgotten all about this until Charlie wrote that note. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=103) |  But Charlie and Judy remember. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=106) |  Anyone else go that far back to CMC? |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=111) |  Not in this crowd. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=112) |  Oh yeah, Robert. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=113) |  So what would happen is we'd do our set and then you're in Samadhi and to some extent |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=124) |  pretty mellow. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=125) |  You're doing your chant and it was the same things. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=129) |  You know, money, pot, lay home, exactly the same. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=132) |  But what would happen during that half hour or so as you're approaching midnight is |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=139) |  that the sonic activity around would escalate. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=145) |  It would just be like a few rounds here or there and then it's like more and more and |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=153) |  more and more until finally it's like the Battle of the Bulge. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=159) |  And then you hear the sound of semi-automatic weapons. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=162) |  And I mean next door. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=163) |  I mean you can see the flash. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=164) |  And you know you can hear the sound of a semi-automatic weapon. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=171) |  It's not just like a gun or something. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=174) |  It's like, it's like crazy, crazy sounds. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=180) |  And we're just like totally blown away. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=183) |  And the contrast was really, really great. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=189) |  And you know it's like, well like they say, you know, it's good for your practice. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=198) |  So that was New Year's, yeah, back in the old days. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=201) |  I was thinking of the daytime. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=203) |  Yeah, the daytime was pretty crazy too. |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=207) |  We were, that neighborhood is, it's Koreatown, it's right where Koreatown intersects with |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=216) |  an El Salvadorian barrio. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=220) |  I don't know what the ethnic thing is now. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=225) |  And then you have a whole Chicano thing also going on. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=229) |  So and it's downtown. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=233) |  So all of our retreats, every single retreat, all day, you could hear, you'd get the mariachis |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=244) |  from one side, you'd get, the Koreans were very quiet, okay, but there were also a lot |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=251) |  of Vietnamese. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=252) |  And so you'd get sort of the Sino-Vietnamese Peking opera kinds of sounds coming. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=258) |  There was always at least one Florence schizophrenic person acting out on the corner. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=268) |  And you got the turf wars going on. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=270) |  They actually ended up blocking off our street with cement barriers eventually. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=277) |  People couldn't even come in the LAPD because it was such a hot drug selling area. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=284) |  And they were right on our front lawn. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=286) |  I mean, literally on the front lawn. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=289) |  And you could hear the turf wars. |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=292) |  People would get into fights. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=293) |  You'd be sitting and meditating and it's like you would actually hear people like slugging |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=299) |  each other, I'm going to kill you. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=310) |  That's the way, that's the old, that's what you were remembering, right? |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=314) |  Do you remember the Chinese Buddhist saying you used to remind yourself? |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=321) |  Oh yeah, I can guess what that was. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=325) |  Let me guess. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=326) |  I probably said if you want a small enlightenment, go to the mountain. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=332) |  If you want a big enlightenment, come to the city. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=339) |  That is a Chinese proverb I heard from one of the Chinese masters. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=346) |  So we used to meditate right in the middle of the city. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=350) |  And so it was a very different New Year's experience. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=355) |  We hear, sometimes we hear a little, you know, like hooray or something. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=360) |  If we're lucky, if we're lucky we get something from the neighbors. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=367) |  It's not like the old days. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=371) |  That was, that was pretty, that was pretty cool. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=376) |  The contrast. |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=379) |  And also it was really good because you learned that you didn't have to have silence in order |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=388) |  to have deep practice. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=389) |  You know, that's the beauty of mindfulness, you can just recycle the reactions. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=397) |  So that's what we used to do. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=398) |  What got a little bit difficult was a lot of people got their cars broken into. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=404) |  You know, usually I'd have to counsel someone after a retreat dealing with calling the cops. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=410) |  And that was, those were the crazy days. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=414) |  Things are a lot more mellow now. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM7ceb91lU8&t=417) |  So I guess we can appreciate that. |

     Charlie left me a note reminding me about the old days. Where are you Charlie? Right here. The really old days that he can remember and a few of you can remember.
