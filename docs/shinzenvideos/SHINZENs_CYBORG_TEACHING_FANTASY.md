     So, there are some standard things that I usually say. Got another one? Oh, sorry. It's okay. And there's five more mics over here we'd like you to wear. Actually, I'm looking forward to the day when there's just a tablet up here and all these recorders here. No teacher, no students. So maybe that'll be in the cyborg future.
