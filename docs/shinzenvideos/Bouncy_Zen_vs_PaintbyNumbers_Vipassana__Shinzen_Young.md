    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=0) |  I will say in appreciation of the Zen tradition that there is a certain kind of dynamic vitality |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=16) |  in the Zen style of enlightenment. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=19) |  It's just a style, okay? |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=21) |  It's not like, you know, oh, well, Zen starts where all this other stuff ends. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=27) |  It's not that way at all. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=28) |  I think that's just BS to claim that, okay? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=32) |  But the way that the Zen people express enlightenment in their actions has a kind of bouncy vitality |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=41) |  to it and spontaneity that is the result of a certain style of cultivation. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=50) |  That's where I see the strongest impact of style. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=54) |  People can get enlightenment doing vipassana practice and sometimes it's a sort of inert |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=61) |  enlightenment. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=62) |  I mean, it's great, okay, compared to non-enlightenment. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=65) |  I mean, there's just no comparison. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=67) |  But there can sometimes be a kind of flatness to it. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=72) |  Not inevitably, I'm just saying sometimes. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=75) |  Whereas the Zen people have this sort of bouncy experience of nothingness that they're able |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=85) |  to convey. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=86) |  What part of the practice of the Zen? |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=89) |  It's the lifestyle. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=90) |  The Zen lifestyle where, see, basically if I were to contrast vipassana and Zen in a |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=96) |  gross oversimplification, I would say that in vipassana you observe your experience first |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=105) |  and you come to an experience of the flow of impermanence and then maybe somewhere down |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=111) |  the line, maybe you begin to ride on that flow of impermanence in how you speak and |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=118) |  move in the world. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=120) |  In Zen, before you realize the impermanent nature of experience, the lifestyle is forcing |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=127) |  you to ride on impermanence because you have to run around and stop on a dime. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=132) |  Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=134) |  Sounds like my life. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=135) |  Am I doing that? |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=138) |  No, because in daily life that just leads to freneticness and confusion. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=146) |  But within the context of Zen training, if it works out well, it leads to an ability |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=152) |  to manifest and disappear. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=154) |  Manifest and disappear in your actions and then with time you come to experience that |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=161) |  as being the nature of experience. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=163) |  So you sort of act it out first and then realize it. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=168) |  So whereas in vipassana you realize it and then maybe ride on it or maybe not. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=176) |  So the advantage to the Zen training when it really works is that it guarantees this |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=181) |  dynamic expression of enlightenment. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=184) |  The possible disadvantage is because it is in some ways sort of like daily life, maybe |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=190) |  if it doesn't work, all it's going to end up doing is making you frenetic and confused. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=196) |  So there's advantages and disadvantages. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=200) |  The vipassana way of working may not lead to the vitality, but it's like a paint by |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=205) |  numbers kit. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=206) |  It's likely to at least lead to something like a work of art. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=213) |  Zen is sort of like, here's the canvas, there's the paints. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=220) |  Now do it. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=221) |  But when it works, it has a stunning vitality to it that you may not find in the paint by |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=227) |  numbers kit. |
