     Are you fixated in confusion? There's nothing wrong with being confused. In fact, being confused is really good. Coagulating when you're confused, not good. The goal is not to avoid confusion, doubt, disorientation. The goal is not to avoid don't know. The goal is to avoid the habitual coagulation around don't know. Uncoagulated don't know is called spontaneity when it comes out of your body and wisdom when it turns in your mind. I repeat, uncoagulated don't know is dynamic spontaneity when it comes out of your body and wisdom when it turns in your mind.
