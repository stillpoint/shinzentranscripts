    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=0) |  Yes? |
    | [00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=3) |  I'd like to request another level of training based on the grid. |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=8) |  I'm thinking back when I started to learn Aikido, there would be drill on a particular |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=12) |  practice and then drill on another practice. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=13) |  It was up to me to choose what I wanted to practice. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=14) |  I tended to just choose the ones I liked best. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=15) |  How about as either a constantly available web page or a downloadable program, you could |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=16) |  put in total length of the session, for example, and then you could change the length of the |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=18) |  session, the length of the session, and the length of the session, and the length of the |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=19) |  session in the course. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=20) |  How about, with the same application, you could do a guide training program. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=21) |  How about as either a constantly available webpage or a downloadable program, |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=27) |  you could put in total length of the session and change time, |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=31) |  and then it would randomly say, |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=33) |  feel in, do nothing, see out, things like that, |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=38) |  so you had to learn to keep changing. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=40) |  You'll see great minds. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=42) |  It's great. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=46) |  The program has set sequence, |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=48) |  it has free choice, and it has random call. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=52) |  It's already written in the program. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=54) |  Is it downloadable? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=57) |  No, the text has been recorded, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=63) |  the flowcharts and the logic is completely done. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=68) |  We're in the process of editing the files |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=72) |  and coding the program. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=77) |  But all my work is done. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=79) |  I recorded everything, including it has that feature, |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=83) |  and my term for it in the program, I call it, |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=86) |  that you can have a random call. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=89) |  And the very parameters that you mentioned are clickable in the program. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=95) |  That's wonderful. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=96) |  That's like Randori in Aikido. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=98) |  Randori. I forgot about Randori. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=101) |  Yeah, we're going to call it Randori. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=104) |  What does that mean? |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=109) |  Randori? |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=110) |  We charged to find out what that means. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=116) |  Charlie, explain Randori in Aikido. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=126) |  It means instead of working with one person attacking you |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=129) |  for your higher level test, |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=131) |  several black belts are attacking you simultaneously |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=135) |  and you have to be still standing at the end of five minutes. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=138) |  You've got to pay a lot of attention and flow. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=145) |  See, Ran actually, it's funny because it does mean random, |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=149) |  but that's just a coincidence. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=151) |  It's nothing related to English word. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=153) |  Randori means to take, |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=154) |  so it's like you're taking on at random, |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=157) |  literally in Japanese. |
