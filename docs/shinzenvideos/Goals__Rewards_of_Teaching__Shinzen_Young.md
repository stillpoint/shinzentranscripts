    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=0) |  So what is the most rewarding thing for you as a teacher? |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=11) |  Not hard to imagine. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=13) |  It's seeing progress of people that study with me. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=18) |  That's the most rewarding thing. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=23) |  And that progress takes various forms. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=26) |  Some people experience little progress, little pieces of progress. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=31) |  Every once in a while somebody actually has a major insight. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=41) |  So that's what's rewarding for me as a teacher is seeing the progress of the students. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=49) |  I only judge my worth as a teacher in terms of the progress of the student. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=57) |  Confucius said, not to learn is the student's fault. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=62) |  Not to teach is the teacher's fault. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=65) |  I disagree. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=71) |  If the student doesn't learn, it's not the student's fault. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=74) |  It's the teacher's fault. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=76) |  It's my fault. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=79) |  In other words, it's the job of the teacher to make it possible for the student to learn. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=85) |  We can't say, oh well, you don't have the right karma or whatever. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=91) |  It's like if they're not getting it, it's on me. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=93) |  It's not on them. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=95) |  So to find a way to communicate with them. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=98) |  So you're talking about communication skills. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=101) |  Well yes. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=102) |  Unless you're doing a transmission. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=104) |  You asked me what's most rewarding. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=109) |  In general, what's most rewarding is when the students make progress. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=121) |  If a student happens to have a classical liberation experience, which happens occasionally, the |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=129) |  sudden kinds of things, that of course is really, really good. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=136) |  So that's extremely rewarding. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=141) |  The other rewarding thing for me is if I can figure out something new, something that hasn't |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=151) |  been tried before, that works. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=154) |  Which you do on a daily basis. |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=156) |  You're always coming up with something new. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=158) |  Well I go around with a notebook. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=162) |  I would say that although I've been guiding people for some 35 years, I learn something |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=171) |  new every day. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=173) |  And I take notes on my own process. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=178) |  Every once in a while I get these epiphanies of creativity with regards to how you can |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=185) |  teach people. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=186) |  And when I get one of those, that's really, really good. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=191) |  And that's extremely fulfilling. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=194) |  I try it out and it actually works. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=197) |  My ultimate goal as a teacher is that anything I have personally experienced, I could lead |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=205) |  anybody else to that experience. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=208) |  That's what I set for myself as my goal. |

     So what is the most rewarding thing for you as a teacher? Not hard to imagine. It's seeing progress of people that study with me. That's the most rewarding thing. And that progress takes various forms. Some people experience little progress, little pieces of progress. Every once in a while somebody actually has a major insight. So that's what's rewarding for me as a teacher is seeing the progress of the students. I only judge my worth as a teacher in terms of the progress of the student. Confucius said, not to learn is the student's fault. Not to teach is the teacher's fault. I disagree. If the student doesn't learn, it's not the student's fault. It's the teacher's fault.
