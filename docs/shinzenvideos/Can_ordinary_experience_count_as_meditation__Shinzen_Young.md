    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=0) |  an art, for example, piano playing or the martial arts or dancing, they might approach |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=14) |  the art in a way that not only do they become extraordinarily focused while they're doing |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=20) |  their art, but that there's a carryover into daily life and they notice month after month, |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=26) |  year after year, as the result of having done that art in a certain way, their base level |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=33) |  of focus in daily life has changed. |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=36) |  So even though they're not calling it meditation, it is de facto a meditation. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=43) |  So if I do that, I don't have to actually do regular meditation, I can just do my ballet |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=48) |  or piano? |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=49) |  Well, yes, but there's a tricky point because the issue is not do you become extraordinarily |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=56) |  focused while you're doing the endeavor. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=60) |  That's not that uncommon. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=63) |  What is much less common is that there's a carryover and you notice in daily life, in |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=71) |  other activities, that because of the way you're doing your art, that every moment of |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=78) |  your life is being informed by an elevated sense of focus. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=83) |  That's fairly unusual, but that is zen and the art of. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=87) |  You may have heard that expression, zen and the art of archery, zen and the art of flower |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=92) |  arranging tea. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=93) |  Is that in the zone too? |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=95) |  Yes and no. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=96) |  No? |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=97) |  It is yes in the sense that there is this locker room or sports term to be in the zone. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=103) |  And that is the term that's used for entering a state of extraordinary concentration, say |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=111) |  during your performance of sport. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=113) |  And of course, it's highly desirable. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=116) |  The baseball player, Ted Williams, used to say he knew he was in the zone when he could |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=123) |  see the pitch coming at him. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=127) |  He could see the stitches on the ball and those pitches come at like 100 miles an hour, |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=132) |  right? |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=133) |  So sports people call that in the zone. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=136) |  Once again, it's not entirely uncommon for somebody to, quote, enter the zone during |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=141) |  their performance. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=143) |  What is uncommon is that they do it in such a way that there's a carryover into daily |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=148) |  life. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=149) |  There has to be the carryover. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=151) |  Remember I defined the common denominator of meditation is, well, not just concentration, |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=157) |  but your base level of concentration. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=159) |  When you're not trying to be concentrated, what are you like in daily life? |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=165) |  To count as meditation, something has to consistently elevate your base level of concentration. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=174) |  So anything that does that is a meditation, whether it's called meditation or not. |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=180) |  But it's not just a matter of you get concentrated while you do it. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=184) |  It's a matter of you get concentrated while you do it in a way that it retrains your ordinary |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=190) |  perceptions. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=193) |  So that's why I'm very specific about elevate your base level, because it's not uncommon |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=198) |  that a person will become extraordinarily focused in some endeavor. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=204) |  It is, however, relatively uncommon that that carryover into daily life in a dramatic way |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=211) |  that grows consistently with time. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=215) |  Without special instruction, usually that doesn't happen. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=219) |  They just have it spontaneously, but there's not the effect on life. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=223) |  So that's why you actually do these formal meditation techniques and practices, because |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=227) |  that more directly elevates that base level? |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=231) |  Well, yes. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=232) |  In other words, we can imagine, based on your line of questioning, that there could be some |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=239) |  ordinary activity you're doing as a meditation. |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=242) |  And then there could be some special exercises that you do that usually involve sitting still |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=249) |  and focusing in some way and whatever, and you do those. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=253) |  Now in either case, you could have an elevation of your base level of concentration, and that |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=259) |  elevation needs to grow dramatically with time. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=263) |  If that's the case, then either of those count as meditation. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=267) |  But usually people that get spontaneously focused, unless somebody points out to them |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=273) |  that it is necessary and possible to carry this over in daily life, they usually don't. |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=280) |  So it becomes a dead end, and it's not really a meditation, even though they may become |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=284) |  very much in the zone while they perform their sport or their art. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=289) |  So in theory, you don't have to do systematic formal exercises that involve sitting and |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=295) |  that kind of thing, in theory. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=297) |  But probably... |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=298) |  Reality. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=299) |  But probably, if you want to do it through an art, you probably will still need some |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=305) |  coaching into how to make your art carry over the state of the zone. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=310) |  Do you do that? |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=311) |  Do you coach people how to turn the art into being in the zone? |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=315) |  Yeah, I can do that. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=316) |  Oh, that's cool. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=317) |  I can coach a person to make their running or their singing, what have you. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=326) |  I can coach them so that they get the carry over. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=330) |  But more typically, people will also do formal meditation practice, sitting in silence and |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=339) |  so forth. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=340) |  So the upshot is that the common denominator of every form of meditation around the world, |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=346) |  inside or outside of religion, would be that they elevate base level of concentration. |

     an art, for example, piano playing or the martial arts or dancing, they might approach the art in a way that not only do they become extraordinarily focused while they're doing their art, but that there's a carryover into daily life and they notice month after month, year after year, as the result of having done that art in a certain way, their base level of focus in daily life has changed.
