    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=0) |  There's a way of resting in the source that, like I say, yeah, it's going to take a lot |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=16) |  of work, but I see how that softens into a big smile based on what's happening during |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=30) |  the sits now. |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=33) |  You know, when I'm sitting here and I'm seeing my physiology like really, really slowing |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=40) |  down and say, oh, OK, this is getting close to a petit mort, little death. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=53) |  Something like that. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=54) |  OK, thank you. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=55) |  Thank you. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=56) |  Hard to put into words. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=59) |  It's like that line from Casablanca, you know, Louis, just like any other man, only more |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=64) |  so. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=65) |  All right. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=66) |  We have just enough time, Stephanie. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=70) |  You want more details on your own and as Lama? |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=74) |  No, I don't. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=78) |  But thank you. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=80) |  Although what I'm asking may relate to what you just said. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=85) |  This is a question. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=87) |  It's a report of an experience and a hypothesis I have about it. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=92) |  But I'd like your feedback. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=93) |  It's about processing emotions and possibly different flavors of equanimity. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=100) |  Not sure the practice I've been doing a lot on this retreat. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=105) |  I've been doing a lot of practices, but one is turning back, coming from the perspective |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=110) |  of awareness. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=112) |  And I find myself saying this phrase like, oh, seeing is happening. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=117) |  Hearing is happening. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=118) |  You know, and I'm not saying the phrase to get it. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=121) |  That just kind of comes out when I kind of shift there. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=125) |  And then I've noticed a change of strategy for emotions. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=129) |  Then normally when emotions happen, my MO is to turn towards them and surrender and |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=135) |  let it all flow. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=136) |  And if it's really intense, I do expansion, contraction, because it's like a slingshot |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=140) |  to sensation. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=141) |  You know, and I think of that like, well, I'll save that. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=153) |  But now what happens when I'm coming from the place of awareness into the emotion, as |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=160) |  opposed to me participating and opening and allowing and having this clarity, it's almost |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=168) |  like I'm coming from this place of a calmness, a stillness, a kind of silent vastness. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=175) |  And it's like, I'm just waiting for this thought or feeling to reveal its emptiness. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=186) |  Or I was doing that, and then I thought, oh, let me just watch expansion and contraction |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=191) |  in it and let it dissolve. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=193) |  And I think those might be the same thing. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=195) |  And the word that keeps coming out of my head when I'm doing this is, oh, it's not real. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=200) |  Oh, it's not real. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=201) |  It's all empty. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=202) |  It's all empty. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=203) |  And so I was wondering, as I'm doing this and feeling the stickiness be less sticky, |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=212) |  is this, is that a different flavor of equanimity? |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=215) |  Am I dissolving the craving at a deeper level? |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=220) |  I do believe both involve a kind of radical equanimity, but the first one feels like it |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=226) |  has more of my participation in it. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=229) |  And the second one is almost identifying there's not a problem in the first place. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=234) |  So I just wanted to know if you could talk about that a little bit. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=240) |  Actually this is going to be one of those questions that has a pretty short and I hope |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=245) |  actually a spot on answer. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=250) |  Maybe I can do it in one. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=255) |  One finger's in. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=256) |  All right. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=257) |  Yes, Choshin's trying to pass her koan. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=268) |  Okay, so the general vibe I get from your report, the overall report, what pops into |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=281) |  my head is figure ground reversal that you hear me talk about. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=289) |  That at some point you go from God is a fantasy inside a material world to the material world |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=306) |  is a fantasy inside God. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=309) |  That's a figure ground reversal. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=312) |  And it sounds to me like you're being taken down that path, which is very good. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=320) |  It's taking... |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=323) |  Well, it's taking you. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=330) |  You're moving into what the Catholics used to call the passive night as opposed to the |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=339) |  active night, the dark two sides. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=343) |  This is the passive night. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=345) |  It's taking you more and more. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=349) |  And the deeper it takes you, the more effortlessly animated you become when it gives back space |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=365) |  time for your existence. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=370) |  So that's what I heard. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=375) |  You're moving towards that shift, and that's an important shift. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=383) |  That's the authentic person without a fixated center, right? |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=391) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=393) |  Okay. |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=395) |  Thank you for that clear but short answer. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=398) |  Well, thank all of you for the wonderful work and the wonderful interactions. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=405) |  It's a mihaya, as we say in the language of my people. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=410) |  That means a joy that gives you chai, it gives you life. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=416) |  So I think we're good. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=419) |  And see you, I guess, in the Zendo next. |
