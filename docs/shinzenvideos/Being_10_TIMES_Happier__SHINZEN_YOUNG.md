    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=0) |  An acquaintance of mine wrote a book called 10% Happier, Dan Harris. He's on the nightline, |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=14) |  right? And I think ABC Good Morning America or something like that, right? He's like a |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=20) |  talk hoe, but he's one of us. He famously had a panic attack on camera at some point |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=30) |  in his career, which you can actually see on YouTube. It's like, we'll be there forever, |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=38) |  right? And that was his wake up call that he had to, something was radically wrong with |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=45) |  his life. And a major part of his recovery was to take on this practice, mindfulness |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=53) |  practice. But because he's in the position of being a prominent television personality, |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=62) |  it's sort of cool for us. So he wrote this book called 10% Happier. And he's got a whole |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=72) |  program that goes with it. Actually, he's partnering up with one of my facilitators, |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=76) |  Jeff Warren from Canada. They're on tour now in the US, sort of bringing the message of |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=84) |  mindfulness. So cool that we're that mainstream at this point. Anyway, the title of that book |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=94) |  got me thinking about my own life. So, you know, 10% Happier, and I started to calculate |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=102) |  in my mind, did the like a thought experiment. Okay, at my current age, what would the picture |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=113) |  be if I hadn't made that decision at the age of 25 to, by hook or crook, meditate every |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=123) |  day of my life? What if I hadn't done that? What if I just been one of the million other |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=134) |  things that I could have been as a non-meditator? So where would I be, given who I was at 25? |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=146) |  Extrapolating, where would I be? And then where I know myself to be as the result of |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=154) |  that decision. And objectively, I just, I had to say, it's not 10% happier, it's 10 |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=167) |  times happier. I mean, objectively, easily 10 times happier. Or put the other way, I |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=175) |  would be one-tenth as happy, which actually would be like pretty miserable. So anyway, |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P7q2MW5upg&t=184) |  I encourage you in that regard. |
