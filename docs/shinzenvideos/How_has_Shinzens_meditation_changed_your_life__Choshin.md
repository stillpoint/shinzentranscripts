    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=0) |  So tell me about, how long have you been with Shenzhen? |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=14) |  23 years. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=15) |  My daughter was 3. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=16) |  That's how I keep track and she's 26 now. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=19) |  Wow. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=20) |  So in 23 years, I'm sure you've had a lot of experience with Shenzhen's techniques. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=26) |  Just off the top of your head, give me an example of how his techniques have changed |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=33) |  your life. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=34) |  There might be many, but just pick one. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=38) |  I have to say that often, things that might have bothered me in the past, barely register |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=46) |  on the scale now. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=48) |  So when I talk to people about meditation, I will say it makes my tiny, tiny little things |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=58) |  very beautiful or passionate or pleasant. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=67) |  And then things that are huge emotionally, reduce it to something that is very manageable |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=74) |  or not there at all. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=77) |  But I can't imagine people living through some catastrophic things. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=83) |  You know, people have terminal cancer, terminal illness, and I can't imagine my life without |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=89) |  this practice to sort of even things out and give me a better perspective on the highs |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=96) |  and the lows. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=97) |  All right, you wanted to add one other thing? |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=101) |  I wouldn't say the most important, but for me, the understanding of impermanence has |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=113) |  been a huge support, I guess, in my life. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=122) |  You know, understanding that things will change, things will go away, you will lose things, |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=130) |  you will gain things, and then lose them. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=133) |  That to me has been a really, really helpful thing in my life, not just for losing loved |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=140) |  ones, but also feeling equanimous with, well, this is the way it is today, but tomorrow, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=147) |  who knows? |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=149) |  So that sort of helped me through the... |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=151) |  Through acceptance. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=153) |  Exactly, yeah. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=154) |  And I think it rules my life a lot. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=157) |  I think I probably depend on that a lot. |
