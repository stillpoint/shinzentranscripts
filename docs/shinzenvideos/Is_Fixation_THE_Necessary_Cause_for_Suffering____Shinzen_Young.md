    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=0) |  You'll recall our conversation about necessary causes. I find this very interesting because, |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=15) |  as I mentioned, one layer of necessary cause can have a deeper layer of necessary cause |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=24) |  underneath it that may or may not be evident until we investigate. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=32) |  So Sasaki Roshi, who as we speak is 104 years old, the oldest living Buddhist master and |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=43) |  still has a complete functional teaching load at that age, he talks about a necessary cause |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=51) |  for suffering also. It's clearly related to tanha, but it's not the same word. He doesn't |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=59) |  use that very often. There is a word in Japanese that means tanha, shujaku. But I've hardly |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=68) |  ever heard him talk about shujaku. Instead he says, jiko wo kotei suru koto wa yoroshiku |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=80) |  nai, meaning it is not a good thing to fixate the self. He talks about fixation as a necessary |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=91) |  cause of suffering. All you have to do is unlearn the habit of fixation and you can |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=97) |  pass all the koans and you will be enlightened and happy. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=105) |  So what I find interesting in this formulation is that he uses a related but different word, |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=115) |  subtly but significantly different word for the necessary cause for suffering. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=119) |  And it doesn't have the connotation for the positive. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=124) |  Well it has a very different, I mean if you say craving it has a certain reverberation. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=132) |  If you say fixation, even though it's related, it has another reverberation. And the reverberation |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=140) |  of fixation is well that's starting to sound like a global physical parameter in the information |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=147) |  processing circuitry of the nervous system. A global physical parameter. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=153) |  I mean I got it. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=155) |  Examples of global physical parameters in nature would be viscosity in a hydrodynamic |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=162) |  system or resistance or impedance in an electrical system. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=176) |  Didn't the Buddha talk about a potter's wheel having friction? |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=185) |  I seem to vaguely remember a metaphor like that but I don't remember the specific. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=189) |  It's like the potter's wheel if it has friction versus when it moves smoothly. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=194) |  We're going to have to look that up. That sounds extremely interesting if you would |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=198) |  find that for me. That might be, wow, we should definitely look that up. That's a homework |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=204) |  assignment. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=205) |  There we go. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=209) |  And actually friction in a mechanical system. So if something analogous to electrical resistance |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=223) |  or hydrodynamic viscosity or friction and so forth, if something analogous to that is |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=236) |  also a necessary cause for suffering, then that sort of makes us think, well, that's |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=243) |  starting to sound more like talking about the brain and the nervous system. Whereas |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=250) |  craving is somewhat, I mean, sure, we know there are centers, etc., etc. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=256) |  Right, and we're connected to a sense of self that's craving versus fixation that |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=259) |  something's happening in the system. |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=261) |  That's sort of like something that either happens, in nature things freeze, they melt. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=268) |  So what is particularly interesting is if we think about a parameter like what's called |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=276) |  the Reynolds number. Now this is a characteristic of flow systems. There's a way of computing |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=290) |  a parameter which characterizes the flow regimen, flow regime. So I won't go into the details |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=301) |  obviously, but if you have a flow field and its Reynolds number exceeds a certain value |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=308) |  then it goes turbulent. But if it isn't at that level, it's smooth and laminar. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=318) |  So if suffering were analogous to turbulence in the flow of the senses, I'm not saying |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=328) |  it is, but let's say it were, then we could model. And if non-turbulence, or if the turbulence |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=354) |  was dependent on some sort of parameter that we could identify with the physical functioning |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=360) |  of the nervous system. For example, there's something called the attentional blink, which |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=367) |  I won't go into the details, but it basically measures how much fixation there is in your |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=372) |  moment by moment concentration. And that can be measured now with science. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=378) |  By the movement of the eye you mean? |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=381) |  No, I mean it's a blink metaphorically, not physically. That's why I say I'm not going |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=387) |  to go into details. There's a lot to say about it. You can look it up on the internet. But |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=392) |  essentially it's something that can be measured now with reaction times. And it's physical, |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=401) |  it's not subjective. It can be objectively measured and it's thought to correlate with |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=406) |  the degree to which one is inappropriately holding on to things. |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=411) |  Really? |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=412) |  Yes. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=413) |  Wow. |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=414) |  And therefore... |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=415) |  But there's a judgment there, appropriate and inappropriate. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=419) |  Well, no there's not, and that's why I'm not going to go into the whole... |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=423) |  Got it, got it. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=424) |  Basically, well I guess I have to now. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=426) |  I'm sorry. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=429) |  Let's say that you're given a sequence of sensory events, and your job is to track the |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=435) |  sensory events. If you inappropriately hold on to a previous event, you're going to blink |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=445) |  or miss the arising of the next event. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=448) |  Oh yeah. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=449) |  So what they found is in meditators, there's less of that. |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=453) |  Oh, okay. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=455) |  Seeming to indicate... |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=457) |  And it's more presence? |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=459) |  Well, it's related to sensory clarity, but it's also related to the equanimity of not |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=464) |  inappropriately holding. |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=467) |  So we're already beginning to get some... |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=470) |  And this is completely objective. It doesn't require any self-report, because it's either |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=475) |  sought or you didn't. I mean, that's a self-report, but it's not really because they present it |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=482) |  and you either click or you don't. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=485) |  It's not like, well yeah, I remembered that, I'm going to tell you. So it's very objective |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=493) |  in what it's measuring. Now I'm not saying that that correlates to what Sasaki Roshi |
    | [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=499) |  calls fixation, but it's already beginning to be a glow... It doesn't matter what you're |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=505) |  attending to, this phenomenon could be in any of the senses. It's already beginning |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=510) |  to look at possibly another necessary cause for suffering. If something like the attentional |
    | [00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=518) |  blink is related to what Sasaki Roshi calls fixation, and then you can untrain that, or |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=528) |  maybe cause an intervention that prevents it of some sort. I don't know what, but let's |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=537) |  say it's possible to do that. |
    | [00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=539) |  Now we're talking about eliminating other kinds of necessary causes for suffering. Or |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=547) |  let's just say that we take the early Buddhist one, tanha. So when you have tanha, all you've |
    | [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=560) |  got to do to experience nirvana is get rid of tanha. In other words, all you've got to |
    | [00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=568) |  do is knock that card and the house of cards that is the suffering falls. |
    | [00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=574) |  Let's say that what the Buddha called tanha is actually on the second tier of that house |
    | [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=583) |  of cards. Let's say that at a deeper tier, there's something that has to happen physiologically |
    | [00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=592) |  in your nervous system for tanha to arise. Hypothetically, that is not unreasonable. |
    | [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=603) |  That means any and all tanha, not just craving for cocaine or shopping, but any and all. |
    | [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=610) |  Let's say that there is a necessary cause behind the necessary cause. And the necessary |
    | [00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=618) |  cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neurophysiological in nature. Then |
    | [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=628) |  there could be interventions that directly address that neurophysiological. |
    | [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=632) |  So you knock out the physiological necessary condition for tanha, therefore you knock out |
    | [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=644) |  tanha, therefore you knock out what blocks perfection. So theoretically, or potentially, |
    | [00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=655) |  any piece of research into craving, if it were done very deeply, might unlock a key |
    | [00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=668) |  physiological mechanism. What I find interesting is that you can't get much funding for research |
    | [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=679) |  on enlightenment, but you can get funding for research on drug addiction. |
    | [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=691) |  But if research on drug addiction were to go very, very deep and very, very broad, it's |
    | [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=701) |  possible that the necessary cause for tanha could be found and eliminated. Which would |
    | [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=710) |  mean, if we take the Buddhist model, that there would be a physiological, and don't |
    | [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=719) |  ask me what kind, because I don't know. If I did know, I'd get the Nobel Prize. I have |
    | [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=723) |  no idea. Is it some super kind of biofeedback? Is it fMRI biofeedback? Is it TMS stimulation? |
    | [00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=731) |  Is it what they call DREADS, which sounds bad, but they're like these... |
    | [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=737) |  Sounds like a hair stand. |
    | [00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=739) |  No, it's designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting |
    | [00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=746) |  edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows what, but if there were a way to knock out the necessary |
    | [00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=753) |  cause for the necessary cause, and it was purely physiological, then nirvana would actually |
    | [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=759) |  simply happen. Now, what I find the delicious notion is that you can get funding for craving |
    | [00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=770) |  research, and you can get funding for deep and broad craving research, and you can get |
    | [00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=775) |  funding from Republicans, gladly, for deep and broad craving research. Therefore, it |
    | [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=783) |  could come to pass that Republicans become responsible for the entire world of becoming |
    | [00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=793) |  Buddhist. |
    | [00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=794) |  There we go. That was good. That was good. |

=== "Text"
     You'll recall our conversation about necessary causes. I find this very interesting because, as I mentioned, one layer of necessary cause can have a deeper layer of necessary cause underneath it that may or may not be evident until we investigate. So Sasaki Roshi, who as we speak is 104 years old, the oldest living Buddhist master and still has a complete functional teaching load at that age, he talks about a necessary cause for suffering also. It's clearly related to tanha, but it's not the same word. He doesn't use that very often. There is a word in Japanese that means tanha, shujaku. But I've hardly ever heard him talk about shujaku. Instead he says, jiko wo kotei suru koto wa yoroshiku nai, meaning it is not a good thing to fixate the self. He talks about fixation as a necessary cause of suffering. All you have to do is unlearn the habit of fixation and you can pass all the koans and you will be enlightened and happy. So what I find interesting in this formulation is that he uses a related but different word, subtly but significantly different word for the necessary cause for suffering. And it doesn't have the connotation for the positive. Well it has a very different, I mean if you say craving it has a certain reverberation. If you say fixation, even though it's related, it has another reverberation. And the reverberation of fixation is well that's starting to sound like a global physical parameter in the information processing circuitry of the nervous system. A global physical parameter. I mean I got it. Examples of global physical parameters in nature would be viscosity in a hydrodynamic system or resistance or impedance in an electrical system. Didn't the Buddha talk about a potter's wheel having friction? I seem to vaguely remember a metaphor like that but I don't remember the specific. It's like the potter's wheel if it has friction versus when it moves smoothly. We're going to have to look that up. That sounds extremely interesting if you would find that for me. That might be, wow, we should definitely look that up. That's a homework assignment. There we go. And actually friction in a mechanical system. So if something analogous to electrical resistance or hydrodynamic viscosity or friction and so forth, if something analogous to that is also a necessary cause for suffering, then that sort of makes us think, well, that's starting to sound more like talking about the brain and the nervous system. Whereas craving is somewhat, I mean, sure, we know there are centers, etc., etc. Right, and we're connected to a sense of self that's craving versus fixation that something's happening in the system. That's sort of like something that either happens, in nature things freeze, they melt. So what is particularly interesting is if we think about a parameter like what's called the Reynolds number. Now this is a characteristic of flow systems. There's a way of computing a parameter which characterizes the flow regimen, flow regime. So I won't go into the details obviously, but if you have a flow field and its Reynolds number exceeds a certain value then it goes turbulent. But if it isn't at that level, it's smooth and laminar. So if suffering were analogous to turbulence in the flow of the senses, I'm not saying it is, but let's say it were, then we could model. And if non-turbulence, or if the turbulence was dependent on some sort of parameter that we could identify with the physical functioning of the nervous system. For example, there's something called the attentional blink, which I won't go into the details, but it basically measures how much fixation there is in your moment by moment concentration. And that can be measured now with science. By the movement of the eye you mean? No, I mean it's a blink metaphorically, not physically. That's why I say I'm not going to go into details. There's a lot to say about it. You can look it up on the internet. But essentially it's something that can be measured now with reaction times. And it's physical, it's not subjective. It can be objectively measured and it's thought to correlate with the degree to which one is inappropriately holding on to things. Really? Yes. Wow. And therefore... But there's a judgment there, appropriate and inappropriate. Well, no there's not, and that's why I'm not going to go into the whole... Got it, got it. Basically, well I guess I have to now. I'm sorry. Let's say that you're given a sequence of sensory events, and your job is to track the sensory events. If you inappropriately hold on to a previous event, you're going to blink or miss the arising of the next event. Oh yeah. So what they found is in meditators, there's less of that. Oh, okay. Seeming to indicate... And it's more presence? Well, it's related to sensory clarity, but it's also related to the equanimity of not inappropriately holding. So we're already beginning to get some... And this is completely objective. It doesn't require any self-report, because it's either sought or you didn't. I mean, that's a self-report, but it's not really because they present it and you either click or you don't. It's not like, well yeah, I remembered that, I'm going to tell you. So it's very objective in what it's measuring. Now I'm not saying that that correlates to what Sasaki Roshi calls fixation, but it's already beginning to be a glow... It doesn't matter what you're attending to, this phenomenon could be in any of the senses. It's already beginning to look at possibly another necessary cause for suffering. If something like the attentional blink is related to what Sasaki Roshi calls fixation, and then you can untrain that, or maybe cause an intervention that prevents it of some sort. I don't know what, but let's say it's possible to do that. Now we're talking about eliminating other kinds of necessary causes for suffering. Or let's just say that we take the early Buddhist one, tanha. So when you have tanha, all you've got to do to experience nirvana is get rid of tanha. In other words, all you've got to do is knock that card and the house of cards that is the suffering falls. Let's say that what the Buddha called tanha is actually on the second tier of that house of cards. Let's say that at a deeper tier, there's something that has to happen physiologically in your nervous system for tanha to arise. Hypothetically, that is not unreasonable. That means any and all tanha, not just craving for cocaine or shopping, but any and all. Let's say that there is a necessary cause behind the necessary cause. And the necessary cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neurophysiological in nature. Then there could be interventions that directly address that neurophysiological. So you knock out the physiological necessary condition for tanha, therefore you knock out tanha, therefore you knock out what blocks perfection. So theoretically, or potentially, any piece of research into craving, if it were done very deeply, might unlock a key physiological mechanism. What I find interesting is that you can't get much funding for research on enlightenment, but you can get funding for research on drug addiction. But if research on drug addiction were to go very, very deep and very, very broad, it's possible that the necessary cause for tanha could be found and eliminated. Which would mean, if we take the Buddhist model, that there would be a physiological, and don't ask me what kind, because I don't know. If I did know, I'd get the Nobel Prize. I have no idea. Is it some super kind of biofeedback? Is it fMRI biofeedback? Is it TMS stimulation? Is it what they call DREADS, which sounds bad, but they're like these... Sounds like a hair stand. No, it's designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows what, but if there were a way to knock out the necessary cause for the necessary cause, and it was purely physiological, then nirvana would actually simply happen. Now, what I find the delicious notion is that you can get funding for craving research, and you can get funding for deep and broad craving research, and you can get funding from Republicans, gladly, for deep and broad craving research. Therefore, it could come to pass that Republicans become responsible for the entire world of becoming Buddhist. There we go. That was good. That was good.
