    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=0) |  Hey there, it's Juliana and I am extremely excited today because it is the official launch |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=7) |  day of the Foundations program. |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=10) |  We are rolling and I couldn't be more excited about it for a couple of reasons. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=16) |  I know that there is really nothing like this out there right now and I know that for two |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=23) |  reasons. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=24) |  One, Xin Zhen's framework, the depth of it, the scope of it, the clarity, the precision, |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=32) |  the thoroughness. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=34) |  He has done the work for all of us, both in terms of having a breadth of experience in |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=42) |  his own training, being familiar with so many different contemplative approaches, having |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=49) |  a scholarly approach, so understanding world contemplative practices on that level, having |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=57) |  a scientific rigor because he partners with hard science to do research around practice. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=68) |  So that gives us a tremendous framework to lean on and it makes our job as trainers so |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=75) |  much easier. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=77) |  So there's that. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=78) |  But then there's also the fact that, and maybe actually this is connected, there's the fact |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=83) |  that in this space right now you either have to take a deep dive into practice, go whole |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=90) |  hog and get certified and spend years in training and years in the certification process, which |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=98) |  is totally amazing and honorable. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=101) |  But the flip side of that is there really isn't anything other than that track. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=106) |  So anybody who is in a helping profession and would maybe like to, for example, a psychotherapist |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=112) |  offering it as a complimentary practice for their patients, not their main thing, but |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=117) |  something they'd like to share because they think it would be useful. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=121) |  So anyone basically who's in a helping profession or in a position to share it who would like |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=125) |  to, they're on their own. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=128) |  You don't really have any kind of framework to lean on. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=131) |  You have to just kind of watch other teachers do it and gather from that how to do it yourself. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=138) |  There isn't anything out there right now that speaks to you if you are either kind of less |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=144) |  experienced or you're in a helping profession and you want to offer it just as part of what |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=151) |  you do or even if you're more experienced, but you don't necessarily want to take a deep |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=157) |  dive into a full-on certification program. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=162) |  So I'm excited because this offers you a framework so that you can get the support you need in |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=170) |  offering other people this training. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=174) |  And lastly, it helps you go deeper with your own practice because you bring that level |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=179) |  of clarity then in order to be able to tell someone else about it, you really have to |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=183) |  know what's going on inside you as you do your practice. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=188) |  So very powerful on all those levels. |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=191) |  Very happy that we've made this available. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=194) |  And today is the opening day. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=196) |  So check it out. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=197) |  We have some wonderful bonuses that are only available for the next seven days. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=201) |  So those bonuses are designed to support you even more. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=206) |  And you can read about them below. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=210) |  And I'll look forward to connecting with you more on your journey in guiding others and |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=215) |  deepening your own practice. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=217) |  And we will connect again soon. |
