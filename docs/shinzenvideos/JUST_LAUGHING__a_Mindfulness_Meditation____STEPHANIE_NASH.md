    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=24) |  the top of your head. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=45) |  So we're now going to do a meditation called a laughing meditation. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=54) |  And laughing is optional. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=58) |  And feel free to jump in at any time but I will give some guidance. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=66) |  Or maybe I won't. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=88) |  Feel free to slap your hand if you want. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=114) |  Put your hand over your shoulders. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=218) |  And whether you laugh or not, you can tune into expansion and contraction, cessation, |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=233) |  and expansion, and contraction, and cessation, and contraction, and expansion, and contraction, |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=258) |  and expansion, and contraction, and expansion, and contraction, and expansion, and contraction. |

    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=353) | ございます |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=482) |  It's a good abdominal workout. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=489) |  Did you guys not? |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=494) |  I did. |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=496) |  I'm going to take a nice deep pleasure. |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=503) |  We'll sigh, really big breath in. |
    | [00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=510) |  We need another one. |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=517) |  Big breath in. |
    | [00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=522) |  That was 10 minutes. |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=528) |  In honor of all laughing meditation people everywhere. |
    | [00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=537) |  Close your eyes and tune into your body. |
    | [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=541) |  What's going on? |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=544) |  If sounds happen, it's just like laughter shock. |
    | [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=548) |  If you have to laugh, laugh. |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=553) |  Just really tune in and feel the flow. |
    | [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=556) |  Where are you feeling? |
    | [00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=558) |  Anything that wants to spread, let it. |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=564) |  Open to the massage from the inside through the body. |
    | [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=572) |  What's the face feel like? |
    | [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=578) |  Belly, hands, feet, whole body. |
    | [00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=607) |  It's very serious. |
    | [00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=626) |  Hear the sounds of laughter. |
    | [00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=629) |  Other people's laughter. |
    | [00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=631) |  Feel it on your body. |
    | [00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=660) |  Mm. |
    | [00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=716) |  I'm going to die. |
    | [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=718) |  I'm going to die. |
    | [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=720) |  I'm going to die. |
    | [00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDRr8UEIP9E&t=730) |  As much as it pains me to do this. |
