    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=0) |  So, taken together, I have four standard techniques for training people into what I sometimes |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=17) |  jokingly call the Zen bounce or spontaneity or cultivating flow within your motor circuits. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=30) |  So one technique is auto move, and an easy way to do that I demonstrated, sort of the |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=36) |  auto walk thing. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=38) |  Another technique is auto speak, and an easy way to do that is like auto chant. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=46) |  The way to cultivate spontaneity and thought is the auto think technique. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=54) |  I described that briefly. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=55) |  There's actually some more details, but the good news on that is I have a very complete |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=61) |  blog in my blog spot where I talk in total detail about how to do the auto thinking technique. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=70) |  So that's a third technique. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=72) |  Often, I'll use a strategy of having people work with individual elements and then having |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=79) |  people work with the whole system. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=81) |  So if you want to get crazy, you can auto everything. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=86) |  It means you try to taste your body moving while you sort of do some sort of chant, and |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=92) |  you're covering your mind space and aware of a global unfixated state there. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=98) |  You're doing that all together. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=100) |  So that would look something like this. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=106) |  1, 2,3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=114) |  1, 2,3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=117) |  1, 2... |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=118) |  Thank you. |
