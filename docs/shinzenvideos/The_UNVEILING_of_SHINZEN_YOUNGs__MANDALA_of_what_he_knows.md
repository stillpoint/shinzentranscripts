    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=0) |  Cool, huh? |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=7) |  Wow. |
    | [00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=10) |  Wow. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=12) |  Applause. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=17) |  Wow. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=20) |  It's pretty, isn't it? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=22) |  Beautiful. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=23) |  Now, like I say, you can't see the symbols from where you are, even if you have good vision, but I'm going to pass out something that you can look at. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=35) |  But here it is. Here is your senses, right? Your conduct, how life treats you, and the answer to the question, what is mindfulness? Concentration, clarity, equanimity. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=56) |  Why practice mindfulness? Total human happiness. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=62) |  What's involved? How do you practice mindfulness? Techniques? Daily cycle? Yearly cycle? Daily cycle? Have a good time. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=72) |  What's the history of mindfulness? Shamanic, prehistoric shamanic origins? Historic meditative traditions? Present research? Possibly dawn of a new age. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=86) |  This is the basics. What, why, where, when. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=92) |  Now the details. Details on what. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=96) |  What is concentration? |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=99) |  Well, I've given all the lectures, I'm not going to go into it, but you know, there's what it is, what it isn't. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=105) |  Instances, the deep view, and the taste. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=109) |  And the same information for sensory clarity. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=112) |  And the same information for equanimity. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=115) |  Details, notice it lines up one to one. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=118) |  Details about this you store here. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=122) |  Details about this, there's the noting board. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=126) |  There's the focus on positive board, iconographically represented. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=130) |  Positive affect is smiling, positive behavior is legs. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=135) |  Positive cognition is a brain. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=138) |  Ideal or archetype is a holy figure. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=142) |  Positive situation is a dawn. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=145) |  Similar to this, but, and then this is other, and you can do it in the visual auditory somatic. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=151) |  We don't show the do nothing board because it's nothing. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=155) |  And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=163) |  There's strategies for formal practice. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=166) |  There are ways of classifying, cutting up the pie of sensory experience. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=170) |  There are ways of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=177) |  How can I deal with this? How can I deal with that? |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=180) |  You can formulate your strategies, that's your tool kit. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=183) |  And also it gives you a detailed view of the history. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=188) |  That's a sundial. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=192) |  You remember that we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=199) |  So these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=204) |  So details about this, details about this. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=211) |  What up here? Details about Mr. Happy Head. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=215) |  Okay. What's surface happiness? |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=219) |  Avoiding pain, getting pleasure, avoiding pain. |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=224) |  What's deep happiness? |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=226) |  Experiencing pleasure times mindfulness. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=230) |  And what's, instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=239) |  What does the mind want? |
    | [00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=242) |  It wants to shine its light on all these different problems. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=246) |  But what does it really want? To shine its light on the socket that it's connected to. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=253) |  What you think you want is to avoid don't-know-mind. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=258) |  But what you really want is to be able to experience don't-know-mind as an empowerment. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=263) |  What you think you want, which is valid, is good situations. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=267) |  Sunny weather, not bad weather. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=270) |  But what you really want, because it leads to these things, is positive behavior. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=277) |  So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=282) |  You ask me what's the definition of enlightenment. |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=285) |  So this is a figure with a smiley face, but the outline is very diffuse. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=290) |  There's no separation between inside and outside. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=293) |  No thinness to separate. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=296) |  And a consequence of that is that you want to serve. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=300) |  You want to serve materially. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=302) |  You want to serve by, this is a mouth teaching mindfulness, mouth it, okay? |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=308) |  You give dana, you support those that serve materially, and you support those who teach. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=315) |  So this gives you more information about this. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=319) |  Now, let's go deep. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=323) |  This is deep, this is basics. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=326) |  Detail, detail, detail. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=328) |  This is just for decoration. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=332) |  But it's sort of cool, because this reminds us that our sensory experience is a yin-yang thing. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=338) |  And we see that in detail over here. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=343) |  This reminds us that our path, our techniques, at a deep level arise through an interplay, |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=351) |  maybe not exactly yin-yang, but there's a little expansive contractive. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=355) |  So this reminds us of the deep view over here. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=360) |  This is practice, this is the deep view of practice. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=363) |  The interplay of active versus passive. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=366) |  Work with the parts, work with the whole. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=368) |  Make discriminations, break discriminations. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=371) |  Manifest a self, go into the no self. |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=376) |  So this is the sort of the yin-yang, the inner game of practice is here. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=384) |  And the sort of yin-yang of sensory experience, the basic molding forces, |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=390) |  the tug of subjective versus objective activation, |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=394) |  the surface manifestations of expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=399) |  the deep manifestations of expansion and contraction, |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=402) |  and the effortless activity of time itself, rising and passing simultaneously. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=409) |  These are the forces, superficial and deep, that mold sensory experience. |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=415) |  So this is the doorway to the deep view on this. |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=422) |  This is the doorway to the deep view on this. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=426) |  And this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe, displayed here. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=435) |  The title of the universe is Omega, which is related to the cosmological constant. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=448) |  It's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=455) |  And the universe is at the finest scale, the smallest spatial scale, is the Planck. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=464) |  And then this thing with the dot, this circumpunk, |
    | [00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=468) |  represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=474) |  and the Planck scale, the cosmic space scale and the Planck spatial scale. |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=482) |  There's all these structures that sort of seem to reflect a contractive core |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=487) |  and an expansive cloud or something along those lines. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=493) |  And what are they? Galaxies, supermassive black hole. |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=497) |  In the center, effusive cloud of stars. |
    | [00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=500) |  Suns, we talked about it, born in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=505) |  and the contraction of self-gravity. |
    | [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=509) |  Planets, core-mantle atmosphere interactions, |
    | [00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=517) |  cause the in and out of the core and mantle, cause the surface continents to flow. |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=526) |  The rising and falling of thermal currents cause the weather to flow. |
    | [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=535) |  The human being, anatomically, it's got nerves at input, |
    | [00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=542) |  there's process in the brain, motor goes out. |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=547) |  The heart and the capillaries, it's an expansive contraction thing. |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=553) |  We have a similar kind of structure. |
    | [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=556) |  And in our complicated, of all creatures, we are the ones that are most aware |
    | [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=561) |  of the input-output in terms of cause and effect. |
    | [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=567) |  And so we live very much in that world also. |
    | [00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=571) |  The cell, I gave a whole talk about how the cell is formed by a lipid bilayer, |
    | [00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=580) |  with polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside |
    | [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=588) |  and the watery environment on the inside, creating an inside-outside situation. |
    | [00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=596) |  Then macromolecules like proteins with nonpolar core |
    | [00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=604) |  and surrounded by polar radicals. |
    | [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=610) |  And so what do those polar radicals do? |
    | [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=614) |  Well, they can migrate into this membrane |
    | [00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=619) |  and start to create very complex interactions that are input-output of energy |
    | [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=628) |  and matter and information into the cell. |
    | [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=632) |  But same sort of deal. |
    | [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=635) |  Contractive core surrounded by this halo and then atoms, |
    | [00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=640) |  but very much in some ways like galaxies. |
    | [00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=643) |  And at the base of it is the mathematics. |
    | [00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=647) |  The operations of mathematics, which all have the same basic structure, |
    | [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=654) |  just different flavor. |
    | [00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=656) |  It's an intertwining of three kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. |
    | [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=667) |  You have step forward, step back, don't move. |
    | [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=679) |  You have stretch out, pull in, don't move. |
    | [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=685) |  You have whirl this way, whirl that way, don't move. |
    | [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=689) |  All the movements of the dancer are represented by the mathematics |
    | [00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=696) |  and therefore the fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization, |
    | [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=709) |  cancellation type of situation shouldn't surprise us |
    | [00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=718) |  because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience. |
    | [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=722) |  And it seems to be something very fundamental about the way that, |
    | [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=729) |  so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this. |

     Cool, huh? Wow. Wow. Applause. Wow. It's pretty, isn't it? Beautiful. Now, like I say, you can't see the symbols from where you are, even if you have good vision, but I'm going to pass out something that you can look at. But here it is. Here is your senses, right? Your conduct, how life treats you, and the answer to the question, what is mindfulness? Concentration, clarity, equanimity. Why practice mindfulness? Total human happiness. What's involved? How do you practice mindfulness? Techniques? Daily cycle? Yearly cycle? Daily cycle? Have a good time. What's the history of mindfulness? Shamanic, prehistoric shamanic origins? Historic meditative traditions? Present research? Possibly dawn of a new age. This is the basics. What, why, where, when. Now the details. Details on what. What is concentration? Well, I've given all the lectures, I'm not going to go into it, but you know, there's what it is, what it isn't. Instances, the deep view, and the taste. And the same information for sensory clarity. And the same information for equanimity. Details, notice it lines up one to one. Details about this you store here. Details about this, there's the noting board. There's the focus on positive board, iconographically represented. Positive affect is smiling, positive behavior is legs. Positive cognition is a brain. Ideal or archetype is a holy figure. Positive situation is a dawn. Similar to this, but, and then this is other, and you can do it in the visual auditory somatic. We don't show the do nothing board because it's nothing. And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes. There's strategies for formal practice. There are ways of classifying, cutting up the pie of sensory experience. There are ways of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world. How can I deal with this? How can I deal with that? You can formulate your strategies, that's your tool kit. And also it gives you a detailed view of the history. That's a sundial. You remember that we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories. So these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards. So details about this, details about this. What up here? Details about Mr. Happy Head. Okay. What's surface happiness? Avoiding pain, getting pleasure, avoiding pain. What's deep happiness? Experiencing pleasure times mindfulness. And what's, instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering. What does the mind want? It wants to shine its light on all these different problems. But what does it really want? To shine its light on the socket that it's connected to. What you think you want is to avoid don't-know-mind. But what you really want is to be able to experience don't-know-mind as an empowerment. What you think you want, which is valid, is good situations. Sunny weather, not bad weather. But what you really want, because it leads to these things, is positive behavior. So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. You ask me what's the definition of enlightenment. So this is a figure with a smiley face, but the outline is very diffuse. There's no separation between inside and outside. No thinness to separate. And a consequence of that is that you want to serve. You want to serve materially. You want to serve by, this is a mouth teaching mindfulness, mouth it, okay? You give dana, you support those that serve materially, and you support those who teach. So this gives you more information about this. Now, let's go deep. This is deep, this is basics. Detail, detail, detail. This is just for decoration. But it's sort of cool, because this reminds us that our sensory experience is a yin-yang thing. And we see that in detail over here. This reminds us that our path, our techniques, at a deep level arise through an interplay, maybe not exactly yin-yang, but there's a little expansive contractive. So this reminds us of the deep view over here. This is practice, this is the deep view of practice. The interplay of active versus passive. Work with the parts, work with the whole. Make discriminations, break discriminations. Manifest a self, go into the no self. So this is the sort of the yin-yang, the inner game of practice is here. And the sort of yin-yang of sensory experience, the basic molding forces, the tug of subjective versus objective activation, the surface manifestations of expansion and contraction, the deep manifestations of expansion and contraction, and the effortless activity of time itself, rising and passing simultaneously. These are the forces, superficial and deep, that mold sensory experience. So this is the doorway to the deep view on this. This is the doorway to the deep view on this. And this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe, displayed here. The title of the universe is Omega, which is related to the cosmological constant. It's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. And the universe is at the finest scale, the smallest spatial scale, is the Planck. And then this thing with the dot, this circumpunk, represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole and the Planck scale, the cosmic space scale and the Planck spatial scale. There's all these structures that sort of seem to reflect a contractive core and an expansive cloud or something along those lines. And what are they? Galaxies, supermassive black hole. In the center, effusive cloud of stars. Suns, we talked about it, born in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure and the contraction of self-gravity. Planets, core-mantle atmosphere interactions, cause the in and out of the core and mantle, cause the surface continents to flow. The rising and falling of thermal currents cause the weather to flow. The human being, anatomically, it's got nerves at input, there's process in the brain, motor goes out. The heart and the capillaries, it's an expansive contraction thing. We have a similar kind of structure. And in our complicated, of all creatures, we are the ones that are most aware of the input-output in terms of cause and effect. And so we live very much in that world also. The cell, I gave a whole talk about how the cell is formed by a lipid bilayer, with polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside and the watery environment on the inside, creating an inside-outside situation. Then macromolecules like proteins with nonpolar core and surrounded by polar radicals. And so what do those polar radicals do? Well, they can migrate into this membrane and start to create very complex interactions that are input-output of energy and matter and information into the cell. But same sort of deal. Contractive core surrounded by this halo and then atoms, but very much in some ways like galaxies. And at the base of it is the mathematics. The operations of mathematics, which all have the same basic structure, just different flavor. It's an intertwining of three kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. You have step forward, step back, don't move. You have stretch out, pull in, don't move. You have whirl this way, whirl that way, don't move. All the movements of the dancer are represented by the mathematics and therefore the fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization, cancellation type of situation shouldn't surprise us because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience. And it seems to be something very fundamental about the way that, so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this. There was a famous biomathematician named Haldane, H-A-L-D-A-N-E, he was an Englishman. This was back in I guess the Victorian or Edwardian period, maybe not quite that old, but back there, early 19th century, he was active. Someone once asked him, based on his study of mathematics and biology, had he been able to discern any characteristics of the creator? Could he say anything about God's personality based on his development of this field of biomathematics? And he said, yes, as far as I can see, the main characteristic of God is that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles. But actually, I would paraphrase Haldane. I think God has an inordinate fondness for contrast and cancellation. That seems to be the pattern that we see very broadly. And that is everything important that I know. Thank you.
