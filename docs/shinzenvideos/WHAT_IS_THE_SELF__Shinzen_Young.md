    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=0) |  Can you explain to me what is the self? |
    | [00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=8) |  So you have thoughts, correct? |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=11) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=12) |  And have you noticed that those thoughts tend to occur constantly? |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=16) |  Always. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=17) |  Right? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=18) |  A lot of thoughts. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=19) |  You also have body sensations. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=23) |  Now have you ever noticed that some of those thoughts are visual, like you have memory, |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=31) |  plan, fantasy, scenes? |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=33) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=34) |  But some of them are auditory also, right? |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=36) |  You hear dialogues, monologues. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=40) |  And your body, some of the sensations are purely physical. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=45) |  But when you have strong emotions, pleasant or unpleasant, you also experience them as |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=51) |  changes in your body sensation, right? |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=54) |  So you have mental experience that consists of visual and auditory thoughts, and it's |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=62) |  continuous. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=64) |  And you have body sensations, some of which are physical, some of which are emotional. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=71) |  And they're pretty continuous too, right? |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=73) |  So you're constantly pulled to mental states and body states. |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=79) |  And nothing mysterious so far. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=81) |  No, no. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=82) |  Anyone can see that. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=84) |  You've probably also noticed that when a thought arises, you tend to say, this is me. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=91) |  This thought is me. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=93) |  Right, right. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=95) |  And how about your body experience? |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=97) |  We even said your, right? |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=99) |  These sensations, they're me, right? |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=102) |  Especially if they're emotional. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=105) |  A broken leg is me, but a broken heart is, in some ways, even more me, an emotional sensation. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=114) |  So you've noticed how moment by moment, there's a lot of thoughts, but we can analyze them |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=120) |  sensorially into something visual and something auditory. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=125) |  And you've noticed how moment by moment, you have physical sensations for sure, and sometimes |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=130) |  emotional. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=131) |  It's incessant. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=132) |  And you've also noticed that as soon as a body state or a mind state arises, you tend |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=138) |  to say, this is me. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=140) |  These are my thoughts. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=141) |  This is my body. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=143) |  So to sum it up, you're going to get different answers depending on who you ask. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=149) |  And those answers are all legitimate. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=152) |  They're different perspectives on the word self. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=157) |  But for me, the simplest way to think about self is, self is a moment by moment experience. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=166) |  And that experience consists of mind and body. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=172) |  And mind is mental image and mental talk. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=176) |  Body is physicality and emotionality. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=179) |  So your mental images, your mental talk, your physical and emotional experience is what |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=186) |  you identify with moment by moment. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=190) |  And that is the ordinary experience of self. |
