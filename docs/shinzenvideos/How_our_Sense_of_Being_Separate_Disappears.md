     that rock solid sense that there is a, that your identity ends with your skin. That there is a tangible barrier between inside and outside. Us versus them, I versus it. It's constantly present in all perceptions. And there's just no escape from it and everybody assumes it's the nature of reality. But after you've ridden on that ox for a while, you cannot escape the opposite of that. You can't escape it. It's in your face 24-7. Everything you see or hear or touch is being loved into existence right in front of you by this activity of the source, this formless womb.
