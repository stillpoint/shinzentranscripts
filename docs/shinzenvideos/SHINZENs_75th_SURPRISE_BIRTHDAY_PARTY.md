    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=0) |  I'm going to show you these. |
    | [00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=7) |  You're going to see some people that you haven't seen. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=16) |  I see. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=17) |  Oh my God. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=18) |  I mean, wow, from this far? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=32) |  Okay, well, I'll try to process all this. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=40) |  Thank you for showing up and for what you do. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=48) |  What can I say? |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=50) |  Does this mean we're not doing the training? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=57) |  Something else is happening. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=60) |  There was no training. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=62) |  It is all about your 75th birthday. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=66) |  That's self-righting. |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=68) |  I'm off the hook then. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=70) |  So what about these facilitators? |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=73) |  Okay, well, here we go. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=84) |  It was a ruse. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=85) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=86) |  You know what? |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=88) |  In the back of my mind, I had a little... |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=91) |  No, he did. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=93) |  Yes, he did. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=95) |  Well, because it's a big number and it's been known to happen. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=103) |  So anyway, but then when we came up here for lunch, |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=109) |  there was not this. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=111) |  So I thought, oh, okay, good. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=115) |  My life will be simple. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=118) |  So it worked in the sense that no, I didn't expect it. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=125) |  But it's great to see you all and get to know each other. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=129) |  Not all of you know each other. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=131) |  You come from all sorts of places and periods and whatever. |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=138) |  Some people here really go back. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=141) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=148) |  It's like talk to people. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=150) |  Yeah, I wish everyone could see. |
