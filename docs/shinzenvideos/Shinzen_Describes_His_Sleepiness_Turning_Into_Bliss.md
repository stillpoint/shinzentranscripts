    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=0) |  Actually, I got really sleepy during the afternoon sit today. And, you know, I mean, I've been |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=19) |  doing this for decades and decades and I learned something new every single time. It's amazing. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=31) |  So what I did is I got really physical with it. It was just like the physical sensations |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=38) |  of sleepiness. And I did the thing that I described in the group process this morning |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=44) |  about zoom in and zoom out. So the primary was there was one primary here and one primary |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=52) |  here. I get this sort of yucky sensation here and then I get this painful, yawny hypoxia |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=59) |  sensation here. So I like zoomed in to the center and then I was able to have this expansive |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=67) |  concentration where I could really feel the whole body at once. I mean, like really in |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=73) |  a lot of detail, but just that one flavor, the sleepiness flavor. So like zoom in and |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=81) |  then cover the whole thing and do the same thing here. And man, about halfway through |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=85) |  the set, it just, it just turned into this like slow lava lamp thing. And it just got |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=95) |  like really integrated and really blissful. It's like, anyway, so, you know, you got to |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=105) |  make a start somewhere and you learn and then you learn more and you learn more and you |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=113) |  grow with it. |

     Actually, I got really sleepy during the afternoon sit today. And, you know, I mean, I've been doing this for decades and decades and I learned something new every single time. It's amazing. So what I did is I got really physical with it. It was just like the physical sensations of sleepiness. And I did the thing that I described in the group process this morning about zoom in and zoom out. So the primary was there was one primary here and one primary here.
