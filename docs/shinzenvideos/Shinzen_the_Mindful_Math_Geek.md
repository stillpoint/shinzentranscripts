    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=0) |  You have often called yourself a geek. |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=9) |  I don't want to call you a geek unless you've already done it. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=15) |  Have you always been a math science person? |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=19) |  No, actually I did extraordinarily poorly in math and science in school. |
    | [00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=28) |  I hated it and it was a source of huge consternation in my family when I would come back with D's |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=36) |  and F's in junior high and high school. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=43) |  My dad was good at math and he liked it. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=47) |  They expected me to perform well in school, but I did poorly in general in school and |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=53) |  particularly poorly in the area of the math and science classes. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=58) |  So when I would get home, there'd be a shitstorm around my report cards. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=69) |  So actually, initially I hated it, like I guess a lot of people do, and I did poorly |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=77) |  in it. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=78) |  Very poorly in it, actually. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=80) |  And I had a lot of emotional scarrings around that in my life. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=85) |  What do you mean? |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=87) |  Well I had a lot of self-doubt and anger and fear and sadness, emotions around my inability |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=100) |  to be able to understand these subjects. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=105) |  And how did you go from that to delight at scribbling mathematical formulas on a piece |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=111) |  of paper as you do now? |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=113) |  Well, first there was a motivation. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=117) |  I had a conjecture way back in the early 70s that something stunningly important could |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=126) |  come about if the best of the East and the best of the West were to mate and cross-fertilize. |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=136) |  The best of the East is the internal science of meditation, especially in my opinion, mindfulness, |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=146) |  which in many ways shares the methodology of science. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=150) |  You divide and conquer, you break things into their elements, you see how they interact. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=155) |  It's very quantifiable, actually. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=158) |  So it occurred to me, having reached the peak of Asia, the pinnacle of that culture, which |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=167) |  is the internal science of meditation, what peak remains? |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=171) |  Well, if we look at the landscape of all of human culture, the only comparably impressive |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=179) |  peak is Western science. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=182) |  So I wanted to study Western science when I came back from the monastery because I knew |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=188) |  that I would meditate my whole life. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=190) |  And I felt that sometime in the future, the dialogue between Western science and Eastern |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=196) |  practice would become important in human history. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=200) |  And I wanted to be able to participate in that, not merely as an expositor of meditation, |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=206) |  but as somebody who knew something about Western science. |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=211) |  So when I got back, providentially, I met someone who was very good at math and science. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=221) |  And he gave me one really good piece of advice. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=225) |  He said, if you want to master the sciences, do the math first. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=230) |  If you ace that, you can do any class. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=233) |  You can do physics, you can do chemistry, you can do biochemistry, you can do neuroscience, |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=239) |  but you have to be able to do calculus and topology and other branches of mathematics. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=245) |  So I got this good piece of advice, which is really master math, and then you'll be |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=251) |  able to ace your science courses. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=254) |  The only better piece of advice I would give somebody is learn to meditate because that |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=261) |  will allow you to undo all the previous conditionings you had around math and science and be good |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=269) |  at it. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=270) |  And I'm living proof that that can happen. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=272) |  I used my meditation, since I had a motivation now, okay, I'm going to apply my meditation |
    | [00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=280) |  practice to doing something I am absolutely convinced I'm incapable of doing and have |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=286) |  a lot of emotional baggage around. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=290) |  So I'm absolutely convinced I can't do this and I've got the high school and junior high |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=295) |  records to prove it, okay, and I've got all these emotions from my family around it. |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=302) |  So how am I going to use the meditation to overcome this? |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=306) |  Three things. |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=308) |  Meditation gives you concentration power. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=310) |  When I was a kid, I'd read the math book, I'd read a paragraph, I didn't understand |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=317) |  it. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=318) |  I tried to read it again, I didn't understand it. |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=321) |  I read it again, I didn't understand it, I gave up. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=324) |  I didn't have concentration power. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=327) |  So now as a meditator, I have concentration power. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=330) |  So I kept coming back and coming back. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=333) |  I had staying power. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=335) |  That made a huge difference. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=337) |  I didn't give up on the third time. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=340) |  That's 100% through concentration. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=342) |  So I had improved concentration, that helped. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=346) |  Then, well, I had the conviction I can't do it. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=350) |  But where does that come up? |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=352) |  That comes up in mental image, internal talk, and emotional type body sensations. |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=358) |  Every time that would come up, I'd break it up into manageable pieces and just observe |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=362) |  it over and over and over again, it came up. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=365) |  Well, who are you kidding? |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=366) |  You'll never be able to do this shit. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=368) |  You've never been able to do this shit. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=370) |  Every time it comes up, divide and conquer, you quantumize, love it to death. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=377) |  I loved that conviction and the emotions to death. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=382) |  Meaning I so affirmed them that they no longer needed to happen. |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=388) |  Then another little meditative skill is the ability to merge with another person. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=394) |  So I started to merge with mathematicians and incorporate within myself the waveform |
    | [00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=402) |  called math geek. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=405) |  There is an activity called math geek, a kind of wave. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=409) |  I internalized that into my personality wave so that I had a mathematician inside of me. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=419) |  Actually a lot of them. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=420) |  I did that intentionally. |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=423) |  Now the cool thing about math is, oh well, let me just say, what I've just talked about, |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=428) |  okay the claim, well you had better concentration so you're going to be able to learn this stuff. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=434) |  You had these emotional deconstruction skills so you could free yourself from the influence |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=438) |  of the past. |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=439) |  And the very weird claim that you can merge with another person and internalize an actual |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=446) |  ability from that person. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=449) |  I can make these claims, okay, but when I sit down to solve a problem, when I sit down |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=459) |  to solve a differential equation, I will either be able to do that or not. |
    | [00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=465) |  If I've been bullshitting myself, it's going to show. |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=469) |  On the other hand, if I can solve a system of differential equations, okay, without looking |
    | [00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=477) |  at the answers, then I know I actually did this. |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=481) |  So there's no BS involved here. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=484) |  And your enjoyment of it has shifted. |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=487) |  Well yes, and it worked. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=488) |  You enjoy differential equations. |
    | [00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=490) |  Yeah, it worked. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=492) |  I started to actually be able to get the answers. |
    | [00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=495) |  I had to start with elementary that you would learn in grade school. |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=503) |  I had to start with multiplication and addition tables. |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=506) |  I knew nothing. |
    | [00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=509) |  And now I do topology and category theory and homological algebra and stuff that you |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=519) |  would do in graduate school, math courses. |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=524) |  That is 100% self-taught and applying the meditation. |
    | [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=532) |  And you know it's not BS because you can do it. |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=534) |  And yes, that becomes this huge source of joy. |

     You have often called yourself a geek. I don't want to call you a geek unless you've already done it. Have you always been a math science person? No, actually I did extraordinarily poorly in math and science in school. I hated it and it was a source of huge consternation in my family when I would come back with D's and F's in junior high and high school. My dad was good at math and he liked it. They expected me to perform well in school, but I did poorly in general in school and particularly poorly in the area of the math and science classes. So when I would get home, there'd be a shitstorm around my report cards. So actually, initially I hated it, like I guess a lot of people do, and I did poorly in it. Very poorly in it, actually. And I had a lot of emotional scarrings around that in my life. What do you mean? Well I had a lot of self-doubt and anger and fear and sadness, emotions around my inability to be able to understand these subjects. And how did you go from that to delight at scribbling mathematical formulas on a piece of paper as you do now? Well, first there was a motivation. I had a conjecture way back in the early 70s that something stunningly important could come about if the best of the East and the best of the West were to mate and cross-fertilize. The best of the East is the internal science of meditation, especially in my opinion, mindfulness, which in many ways shares the methodology of science.
