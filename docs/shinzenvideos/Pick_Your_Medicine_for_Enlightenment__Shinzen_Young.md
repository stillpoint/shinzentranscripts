    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=0) |  We were talking yesterday about how much I like this springy icon because it shows what |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=26) |  we sit on always or where our feet are planted always whether we're aware of it or not, which |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=33) |  is the spring of the air, the vibrancy of emptiness. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=45) |  To experience that in our inner and outer see, hear, feel and to ride on that in how |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=57) |  we express ourselves in body motion, speech, and the voluntary parts of the thinking process, |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=71) |  our triple karma, so to speak, our actions, our motor circuits, to experience the flow |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=80) |  of emptiness in our sensory circuits and to express that very same spirit in the bounciness |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=90) |  and spontaneity of our motor circuits. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=95) |  This is the paradigm that I like to use for how this path works. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=103) |  I mentioned that around the world there are numerous ways and throughout history numerous |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=115) |  fundamental ways have been discovered to come to this. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=122) |  You can deconstruct things through careful observation. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=125) |  I like that because I can turn it into a systematic algorithm that loops and branches. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=132) |  There's in theory the possibility of nurture positive as a path to that, particularly as |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=142) |  it's done in the Vajrayana traditions, the deity yoga, where you eventually learn how |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=148) |  to manifest the deities from the void. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=153) |  At the end of the period of the deity yoga, the period of the deity yoga is called the |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=159) |  cherim, which means the stages of generation. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=164) |  Then that's followed by dzogren, where it's all dissolved back into the emptiness. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=175) |  Often they will use special physiological yogic practices to facilitate getting the |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=183) |  emptiness down into the cellular level of one's being, like the six dharmas of Naropa |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=190) |  and so forth, if you're interested. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=194) |  Versions of nurture positive can achieve this, at least in theory. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=198) |  There's the whole, okay, do nothing approach, just call off the search. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=206) |  Then there's the sort of be conscious of consciousness, self-inquiry, shine the light back on itself, |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=217) |  who am I, what am I kinds of approaches. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=222) |  I think those are sort of the four main, highly contrasting strategies that we find around |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=231) |  the world. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=232) |  I encourage people to do what works. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=234) |  Different things work for different people at different times. |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=238) |  I'm a little bit averse to people that claim there's only one way that is stunningly better |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=246) |  for all human beings, that has just not been my experience. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=253) |  Different things seem to work for different people at different times. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=259) |  So pick your medicine. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=267) |  And hopefully, if you keep with it, it will gradually converge or maybe suddenly converge |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=276) |  to this kind of bouncy experience of, you can call it liberation, you can call it unification, |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=287) |  you can call it annihilation, or you can call it creation. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=297) |  It's my version of creationism, okay. |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=301) |  My version of creationism is that you see how consciousness creates the inner and outer |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=311) |  world moment by moment and you participate in that. |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=316) |  So form is emptiness, that's sort of the first part of the process. |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=323) |  And then emptiness is form, is another theme that presents itself as you begin to be able |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=336) |  to sort of enjoy seeing the world manifest and the self manifest moment by moment, continuous |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=348) |  creation. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=349) |  Bri'ah yesh me'ayin in the Hebrew, the Bri'ah, the creation, yesh means both self and thing, |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=361) |  the creation of self and thing, met from ayin, the divine nothingness. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=368) |  So I left off by saying that in the Jewish mystical tradition, the ability to do that |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=380) |  is related to an important theme called tikkun olam, the mending of the world, which of course |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=386) |  is none other than the bodhisattva service. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=392) |  So |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=393) |  if you've watched a festival, then you would in no way wrong to be over on that. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=399) |  I mix with it a bit and people would comment that you know what, I communities with an |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=407) |  overdone Irish people, and you found that you're misbehaving, misbehaving, but still |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=413) |  doing misbehaving, from what I know from prison as well, there normally won't be gang |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=417) |  relations, but missing one member, the priest of the church from Pas JJ, they were like |
