    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=0) |  So, I like to give people the option of practicing every kind of meditation technique that has |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=16) |  ever been developed in the history of world mysticism. And I have this sort of grid where |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=23) |  I classify all the techniques, like a periodic table of meditation strategies. So, I try |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=34) |  to include in that everything that was a major invention or a major innovation. Some things |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=45) |  in meditative technology have only been discovered once, many things have been discovered many |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=51) |  times in different cultures. So, one thing that, as far as I know, was only strongly |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=60) |  emphasized once is the notion of expressing spontaneity through how you move, how you |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=74) |  speak, and the motor part of how you think. This is an aspect of liberation practice that |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=85) |  was very much appreciated and developed within the Chan school of Chinese practice. It's |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=96) |  particularly associated originally with a master named Mazu, and that eventually evolved |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=102) |  into the Linji or Rinzai, as it's called in Japanese school of Zen. So, they put a big |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=114) |  emphasis on manifesting impermanence, manifesting emptiness, manifesting non-self in how you |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=124) |  move the body, how you sort of channel the words that are coming through your lips, and |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=134) |  eventually also learning how to think without thinking. So, there's sort of like, if you |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=142) |  do without thinking, there's a just happeningness and it's merged with the dynamic emptiness |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=150) |  of nature, yang and yin. If you speak without thinking, same thing. A little trickier is |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=159) |  to think without thinking, but it's the same general idea. It turns into thoughts that |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=165) |  are spontaneous, creative, wise, and so forth. So, traditionally in Buddhism, they speak |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=176) |  of the three karma-dvara, the three gates of action, kaya-vak-citta or kaya-vak-mana, |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=186) |  means bodily motions, speech actions, and thought actions. So, I have in my repertoire |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=195) |  of techniques a quadrant of training that I call spontaneity training. And I teach people |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=205) |  how to access spontaneity in body movement, speech, thought, and even all three at the |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=213) |  same time. So, my word, just to have a convenient word for this just happening, empty but rich |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=222) |  dynamic quality in motion, to have a word for it, I call it auto from the original Greek |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=229) |  meaning spontaneous. Corresponds to certain Asian concepts, the Chinese notion of ziran, |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=238) |  which is shizen in Japanese. And there's many words in Tibetan that have this connotation |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=247) |  of effortless just happening. Anyway, I call it auto to have a word for it. So, there's |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=254) |  a technique of auto-walk or more broadly auto-move, auto-speak, and a specific example of that |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=264) |  would be auto-chant, which is relatively easy to do. And then I even have an auto-think |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=269) |  technique. So, the way you do auto-move is you just sort of tune into some motion that |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=277) |  your body already knows how to do. And you just sort of follow the reflex. You taste |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=284) |  the reflexness, the fact that the motor circuits know how to do it without there needing to |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=291) |  be much of a thinking ego for it to happen. So, it's like being a little kid. When little |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=298) |  kids walk, they just walk for the fun spontaneity or they run for the fun spontaneity or they, |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=305) |  you know, like play around in puddles of water or whatever because it's just like, it just |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=312) |  happens and they enjoy the just happeningness of it. So, to do the auto-walk, you tune into |
    | [00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=323) |  the fact that your body knows how to walk without needing a you. And it's a little intuitive. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=332) |  I can't really describe quite how to do it, but you just sort of get a feel for it with |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=338) |  time. In the monastery, the way that people learn about this is by watching other people |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=346) |  do it during the work periods or as you're walking from place to place. People do this |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=351) |  sort of just walking thing, the more senior monks, and then you sort of pick up on it. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=356) |  So, I'm going to show you my particular way of doing the auto-walk. I'm pretty poorly |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=368) |  coordinated so it's not going to be very elegant, but there will be a kind of spontaneity to |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=374) |  it. So, you just sort of let your legs carry you. You know, I sort of defocus the gaze |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=381) |  and it's just sort of happening and it's sort of fun. It's like you're being a little kid |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=388) |  again. Now, I add a feature that is not required, which is I engage the visual field. It seems, |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=401) |  in addition to this sort of, my legs know how to carry me without me. As I'm moving, |
    | [00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=408) |  it seems like the visual field is expanding in front, but the thing that I just saw an |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=417) |  instant ago is collapsing behind me. So, it's like being a bolus being carried in this funnel |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=426) |  of expanding light in front and contracting light behind. Then, I combine that with the |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=435) |  sort of spontaneity of the movement of the legs and it's like space itself is just sort |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=442) |  of carrying me as I'm walking along. I'm exaggerating now. I don't look this silly usually, but |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=450) |  you get the general idea. It's just sort of expansion and contraction and the legs are |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=457) |  just sort of moving on their own. You could just like play like this for a long time and |
    | [00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=463) |  it's rich because it's dynamic, it's bouncy, but it's empty because there's no one there. |
    | [00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=474) |  That was me making Shinzen do auto-walk for everyone on YouTube. Shin heads everywhere. |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=483) |  And tomorrow, I'm going to get him to do auto-walk while auto-talking, auto-speaking, while auto-thinking. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=492) |  So, stay tuned for more. |
