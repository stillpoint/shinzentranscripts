    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=0) |  Hi, I am Stephanie Nash and I started this YouTube channel in 2009, I think, with the |
    | [00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=9) |  initial intention of introducing Shinzen Young and his teachings to a broader audience than |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=18) |  might normally stumble upon him. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=22) |  And my initial idea was to do interviews with him, maybe, where I ask some questions like |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=27) |  a beginner might ask. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=30) |  Thus the name of this channel has been Shinzen Interviews for a long time and it may still |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=35) |  show up for you as that. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=38) |  We did change the name to Shinzen Videos. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=41) |  I started adding talks and teaching sessions from retreats in addition to the interviews. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=50) |  And I also, with Shinzen's wholehearted approval and encouragement, I have posted bits of interviews |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=58) |  I've done with other teachers as a way of sharing the Dharma. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=65) |  So for more information about Shinzen and his teachings, please go to www.shinzen.org |

    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=88) |  The live practice program, they just started that. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=90) |  He works with someone one-on-one and in 45 minutes helps them with something. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zee25D-MDy4&t=95) |  And it's great training for mindfulness teachers. |
