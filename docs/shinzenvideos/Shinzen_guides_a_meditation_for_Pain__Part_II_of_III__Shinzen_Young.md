    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=0) |  Now, slow down the label just slightly to give yourself more time to sort of soak your |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=13) |  awareness into that secondary sensation. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=21) |  And if there's no secondary sensation, if all the secondaries disappear, you can use |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=26) |  the label nowhere. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=30) |  But if you're drawn to, say, your whole body, like it seems to spread through your whole |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=35) |  body and you're aware of that, then you can use the label whole body. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=50) |  And that's a good suggestion. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=66) |  What was happening during the silence there? |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=95) |  Were you focusing in the same location? |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=100) |  It felt like whole body, but it wasn't enough to say it. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=105) |  Just subtly the whole body? |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=107) |  Subtly the whole body. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=108) |  Subtle is significant. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=109) |  Definitely if there's a hint of whole body, say whole body. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=113) |  And just open up the whole body to it. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=117) |  So, if you... |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=119) |  And guessing and groping is okay, by the way. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=122) |  It's perfectly okay to make a guess. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=125) |  Any questions so far? |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=127) |  It's whole body now. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=129) |  It's a lot of whole body? |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=130) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=131) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=132) |  It may be always whole body. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=133) |  That's actually... |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=134) |  Does it seem like it wants to do that? |
    | [00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=136) |  Yes. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=137) |  When you say whole body, you zoom out and cover the spread. |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=141) |  You know how if you... |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=147) |  You have a local pressure and then you let it spread out. |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=152) |  That will relieve the pressure. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=154) |  If you let those secondary sensations spread over your whole body, |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=158) |  you may find that that dissipates some of the pressure from the local intensity |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=163) |  after enough time. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=165) |  That's the purpose for opening up to the possibility that it spreads over the whole body. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=171) |  So, once again, that's excellent spatial resolution. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=176) |  By resolution, I mean ability to be clear about what you're detecting. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=182) |  So, if it seems to be whole body and it's over and over again, |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=186) |  whole body, just zoom your attention out, cover the whole body, |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=190) |  and just let the sensation ripple and radiate out into space |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=195) |  in all six directions out from your body. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=198) |  Does that instruction make sense? |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=200) |  Yes, it does. |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=201) |  Excellent. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=202) |  So, now I'd like you to continue using the spoken labels. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=205) |  Again, I'll just be doing my own practice while you do that. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=214) |  Hips. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=222) |  Forearms. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=233) |  Ankles. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=245) |  Whole body. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=250) |  That's perfect. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=252) |  By that I mean the tone of voice, the pacing, and the wording are all perfect. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=259) |  Once you establish this awareness, the rest is just a matter of time. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=266) |  The tone of voice indicates that you have a quality that we call equanimity. |
    | [00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=272) |  The pacing of the labels guarantees that you're highly concentrated. |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=278) |  And the wording of the labels guarantees that you're bringing sensory clarity to the experience. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=284) |  In this case, the sensory clarity is the precision with regards to the location of the secondary spread sensations. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=293) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=295) |  Yes. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=296) |  How what you're doing develops those three qualities? |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=299) |  Once you have a momentum of those qualities, then it's just a numbers game. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=306) |  You are setting the stage for nature to break up the suffering from this experience. |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=318) |  It could happen in five minutes or it could take five months, depending on the depth of the challenge. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=326) |  You can tell by the way that you're labeling that you have a momentum of concentration, clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=336) |  Once you establish that momentum, then the rest is just keeping it up and letting time pass. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=342) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=343) |  Yes, it does. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=344) |  Excellent. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=345) |  Now, I'd like you to continue to do that. |
    | [00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=348) |  Once again, I'm just going to do my own practice for a few minutes. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=351) |  We're going to give nature a chance, give some time for it. |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=356) |  Any questions about what we've done so far? |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=359) |  No. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=360) |  It makes perfect sense? |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=361) |  It makes perfect sense. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=362) |  Excellent. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=363) |  I'll pause for a minute and then I'll touch base with you again in a couple of minutes. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=393) |  Rise. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=424) |  You can label a little bit more quickly, just a bit more. |
    | [00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=429) |  That will help with concentration a little bit. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=435) |  You can repeat the same label again. |
    | [00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=441) |  Ankles. Feet. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=464) |  Whole body. |
