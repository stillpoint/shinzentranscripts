    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=0) |  Out of curiosity, what strategy do you generally employ using your technique? |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=11) |  You mean as I'm laughing around in the world? |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=13) |  No, not on the cushion. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=15) |  Oh, on the cushion? |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=17) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=18) |  Mostly both God. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=22) |  Simultaneous expansion, contraction, and their vanishing. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=26) |  So flow and... |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=27) |  Well, both. Both is the label for an awareness that there is simultaneous expansion and contraction. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=35) |  That's part of the... |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=39) |  So the quick answer is in terms of what's on the grid is expansion, contraction, flow. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=44) |  That's what I typically am aware of. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=47) |  Okay. And then last thing was when I was reading in the manual about that for us, |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=55) |  it was... because I love flow and so forth, |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=58) |  but I also saw that it was like don't forget to stay in, |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=63) |  you know, see here and feel rest, focus out. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=67) |  And focus out and focus in just because there's subtle levels that you don't want to... |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=72) |  you know, that you're still needing to process. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=75) |  I understand. So it's okay to have sort of a main practice. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=81) |  But if you're familiar with the whole grid, I encourage people at least occasionally to touch base with other things just to get some balance. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=90) |  But that's just a light suggestion. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=93) |  If you're not familiar with the whole grid, obviously you can't do that. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=97) |  But let's say you're familiar with the whole thing. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=99) |  I think it's... a lot of people have a single thing that they do that's their main practice. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=107) |  And if you are familiar with this other stuff, I think it's useful to touch base at least occasionally with it for rounding purposes. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=116) |  But if you're not familiar with the whole grid, then you just can have just one practice. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=122) |  But remember that one of the ways you push the envelope is by... |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=130) |  if there's a particular approach that you like, you see, well, can you maintain it in motion and then in daily life, etc. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=142) |  So maybe you could get a lot of flow when you're sitting, but can you actually get it while you're talking to people and driving the car? |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=150) |  That's a way of pushing the envelope with the practice. |
