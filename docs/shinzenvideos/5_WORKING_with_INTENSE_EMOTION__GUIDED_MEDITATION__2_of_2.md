    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=0) |  Able to get a little sense of that? |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=24) |  Oh yeah. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=26) |  So that's a catharsis, a releasing of fear. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=32) |  It creates this kind of center of this, it's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=40) |  center but then I get really hot. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=43) |  Yeah, let the joy be there, let the heat be there. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=46) |  These are all reactions to the catharsis. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=50) |  And if the heat produces more fear, then just dissipate that in the fear. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=56) |  Accept that we're going to let go of the fear now and go to the sadness. |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=61) |  And don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=65) |  Same procedure, start with the periphery of the sadness flavor, work with that, see if |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=74) |  it's amenable through a zoom out process to an experience of a global flow in the sadness. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=84) |  If that's feasible, do that and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=91) |  and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness if indeed that's sort of doable |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=97) |  at this time. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=98) |  I'd like you to explore the doability of that with regards to sadness. |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=104) |  Just give it some time. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=127) |  Ever able to get a little hint of that? |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=130) |  Yeah, since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread, I just kind of instead |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=138) |  of, since I didn't quite have the subtle area, I just went around the boundaries of it. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=144) |  That's exactly correct. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=146) |  That corresponds to the subtle, it's just less widespread. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=150) |  That was a good move. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=151) |  I just made the boundaries soft and then treated that like... |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=154) |  That's right, that's what I would have had you do. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=155) |  So you're able to get a little sense of that. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=158) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=159) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=160) |  Now, I'm going to have you do a fairly intricate concentration where you're going to attempt |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=174) |  to experience simultaneously a kind of river of fear and a kind of river of sad that flow |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=188) |  through each other, interpenetrating without interfering. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=196) |  So it's almost like... |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=197) |  Could you say that again? |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=198) |  Oh yeah, right. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=200) |  There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like giant liquid drop that's sort of expanding |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=207) |  and contracting, right? |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=209) |  Right. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=210) |  And there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same essential dance. |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=214) |  Right. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=215) |  Now, you know how in a ghost movie you see that the ghost can walk through the wall, |
    | [00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=226) |  right? |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=227) |  Right. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=228) |  The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=233) |  Now imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=239) |  both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=246) |  each other when they occupied the same place at the same time. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=253) |  So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavored |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=259) |  sad, and they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=266) |  of them can occupy the same place. |
    | [00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=271) |  So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=278) |  each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=284) |  Does this metaphor make sense? |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=287) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=288) |  Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=292) |  Not in this, not this round. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=294) |  This may be the part of the missing piece, because you could get them individually to |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=300) |  flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=304) |  Because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=310) |  interfering, then they won't multiply together into overwhelm. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=319) |  So the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=326) |  flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=333) |  that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=345) |  body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=350) |  Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=354) |  It's an interesting intimacy between them. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=362) |  It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=367) |  And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=374) |  purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. |
    | [00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=434) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=445) |  How's that coming? |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=448) |  Good. |
    | [00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=449) |  Good. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=450) |  Good in what sense? |
    | [00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=455) |  When I can allow them both to share the same space and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping |
    | [00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=466) |  them separate and keeping that line between them, and when I allow them to just kind of |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=472) |  do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, a very intense version of that, |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=481) |  and then it kind of seems to ignite this PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot. |
    | [00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=488) |  So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. |
    | [00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=494) |  Yes, I am. |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=496) |  This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive, but your facial expression |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=501) |  proves it. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=502) |  Yeah. |
