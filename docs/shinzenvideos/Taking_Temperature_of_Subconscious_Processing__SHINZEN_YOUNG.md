    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=0) |  One of my favorite jokes, well not jokes, but just funny things that I'll ask someone |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=19) |  is, do you think that, like you look at a neon light bulb, neon, or that kind of thing, |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=30) |  you can touch it, right? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=32) |  It's cold. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=35) |  But I'll say, do you believe me that the temperature inside that neon bulb is comparable to the |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=49) |  temperature in the core of the sun? |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=54) |  Most people would say, no way, right? |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=56) |  But actually it is. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=58) |  The thing is, there just aren't very many molecules in there. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=62) |  So it doesn't transfer much heat to you. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=65) |  But they're plasma. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=70) |  They're like they're on the sun. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=75) |  They're moving that fast. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=76) |  But it has very little density. |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=81) |  So you touch it, they don't transfer hardly any heat to you at all. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=85) |  So you have no perception of how really much energy there is on average. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=95) |  But like I say, high average kinetic energy. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=98) |  But if you don't have a lot of particles, then the total energy they're going to transfer |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=102) |  to the surface of that bulb is not very much. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=106) |  So anyway, end of physics lesson. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=111) |  What is the metaphor? |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=112) |  Well, you'll recall that Freud thought of the psyche in terms of pressures, because |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=122) |  that was sort of the physics of the day. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=131) |  What I find interesting is that if you parse your mental experience into a visual component, |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=145) |  which would be mental images, and an auditory component, which would be mental talk, when |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=152) |  you start to do that, you're aware of images. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=160) |  A lot of times they vanish right away. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=162) |  You're aware of talk. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=164) |  Sometimes it just vanishes. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=166) |  But at some point, that sort of surface activity tends to go away. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=173) |  But the space, image space, is still there. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=177) |  Talk space is still there. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=179) |  And when you tune into image space or talk space, sometimes you're aware of a kind of |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=188) |  subtle undercurrent of motion, like there's a kind of stirring in talk space. |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=195) |  You may or may not be able to make out words. |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=198) |  You may or may not be able to make out what the conversation is about. |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=204) |  But there's a sort of undercurrent of activation. |
    | [00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=208) |  And there's something analogous to that in image space. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=216) |  And there can also be something analogous to that in your emotional centers. |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=222) |  You're not actually experiencing any emotion per se, but it's like there's something sort |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=228) |  of idling down there. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=233) |  So what is that? |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=235) |  A lot of times people will sort of look upon that as a problem. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=241) |  It's like, I can't get rid of that sort of undercurrent of something going on down there. |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=249) |  Well what that is, is subconscious visual thought, subconscious auditory thought, and |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=260) |  subliminal emotional sensation. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=267) |  And if you explore your inner space, image space, talk space, emotional body space, after |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=277) |  the surface stuff is sort of dissipated, and you're watching that general level of stirring |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=288) |  down there, sometimes it's uniform. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=294) |  It just sort of is at a constant pace. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=300) |  Other times it sort of speeds up and then subsides, sort of bursts and then subsides. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=309) |  So although you're not aware of the specific content necessarily of the subconscious, you |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=319) |  are monitoring, by monitoring that general level of activation. |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=326) |  Do you see the metaphor? |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=330) |  You're taking the temperature of the subconscious. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=334) |  You're monitoring sort of metaphorically the average kinetic energy that's going on. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=342) |  And if the temperature is more or less constant, it's all sort of at the same frequency, then |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=353) |  what's optimal is to evenly cover subjective space and just let your awareness sort of |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=361) |  soak into that whole field. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=365) |  And what that's going to tend to do is break up the, it's going to lessen the viscosity. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=381) |  So density, viscosity, temperature, entropy, these are called state variables. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=390) |  And these are sort of the, this is the great achievement of 19th century physics. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=398) |  One of the great achievements is statistical thermodynamics. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=403) |  So there are these state variables. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=406) |  So if it's more or less like an even level of vibratory activity, then you sort of cover |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=415) |  the whole space. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=416) |  You soak awareness into it. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=418) |  You don't try to figure out what's going on. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=421) |  You give it permission to just sort of move around down there. |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=427) |  And you'll find that that will cause that system to become more and more fluid, meaning |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=435) |  less and less viscous. |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=440) |  On the other hand, if you notice pattern that it sort of activates and then deactivates, |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=446) |  so it sort of like heats up and then suddenly cools off, metaphorically. |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=453) |  What's optimal in that case is to watch the sort of burst of energy and then detect the |
    | [00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=460) |  gone and briefly look down the valley where those little bubbles went to, because they're |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=467) |  pointing right to nirvana, right to cessation. |
    | [00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=471) |  So you get gone, gone, gone, gone. |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=476) |  If it gives you that pattern, then get interested in the rhythm of arising, passing, arising, |
    | [00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=483) |  passing. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=484) |  But this is subtle vibration, sort of shimmering and then dying away. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=489) |  And when that foam sort of dies away, the silence that it points to is the absolute |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=497) |  rest, the still point of the turning world. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=502) |  So there's a metaphor from good old 19th century physics. |
    | [00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=513) |  I mentioned that, so in my mind, I think of this as, well, how cool is this? |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=520) |  If Freud had only known you can actually take the temperature in real time of the subconscious |
    | [00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=525) |  mind. |
    | [00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=528) |  And in doing so, the viscosity of the subconscious gets worked through. |
    | [00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=535) |  And when the subconscious self, the psyche, this inner see, hear, feel self, when it flows, |
    | [00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=547) |  it gets creative and liberated. |
    | [00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=555) |  So that's one of my favorite metaphors, taking the temperature of the unconscious in real |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=564) |  time as a function of space. |
    | [00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=570) |  Temperature of this room is what a scientist would call a scalar field. |
    | [00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=575) |  It means, or a time varying scalar field, means at each point in the space of this room, |
    | [00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=584) |  there's a physical quantity that can be measured by one real number, which is temperature. |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=593) |  And it's a temperature field, a scalar field that varies with time. |
    | [00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=599) |  So the subconscious is actually analogous to a temperature field, because it has location. |
    | [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=608) |  There's the visual part, the auditory part, the emotional body part, and so forth. |
