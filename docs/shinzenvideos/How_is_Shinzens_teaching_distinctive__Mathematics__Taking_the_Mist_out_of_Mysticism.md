    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=0) |  I'd like to define mindfulness as a three-fold attentional skill set consisting of concentration |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=12) |  power, sensory clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=16) |  So to the extent that I am a quote meditation teacher, I teach concentration power because |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=23) |  that's universal to any form of meditation. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=27) |  To the extent that I am a mindfulness teacher, I also emphasize the sensory clarity and the |
    | [00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=33) |  equanimity. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=35) |  Then there is the extent to which I sort of have my own distinctive way of going about |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=41) |  mindfulness and that definitely has certain distinctive characteristics. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=54) |  A lot of it goes to my background. |
    | [00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=56) |  I have a pretty solid amateur knowledge of science and mathematics and that has informed |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=69) |  the way that I teach mindfulness in a very, very deep way. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=75) |  One of the things that you learn if you get into the physical sciences or mathematics |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=83) |  at any kind of depth is you learn habits of precision in expression and thinking. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=92) |  Habits of precision. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=93) |  Of precision. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=94) |  That's correct. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=95) |  In other words, in ordinary colloquial English, force, impulse, energy, potential, momentum, |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=113) |  action, and so forth, they all sort of sound like the same thing and we might use them |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=119) |  interchangeably on occasion. |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=122) |  But in physics, each one of those words that I mentioned means something completely different |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=128) |  and distinct. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=129) |  Each one is defined very, very carefully and in many cases it took centuries for that precision |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=140) |  of language to be honed and perfected. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=144) |  For example, in the area of mathematics, if you take a beginning calculus class, you learn |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=152) |  the definition of something called the derivative of a function. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=159) |  I remember that. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=160) |  You took that? |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=161) |  I did. |
    | [00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=162) |  I don't remember. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=163) |  I remember those words. |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=164) |  I don't remember what they were. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=165) |  You may remember some. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=166) |  You may remember. |
    | [00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=167) |  I remember a volume of a function but I can't remember what it was. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=170) |  Well, you may remember an expression along the lines of, for any epsilon, however small, |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=178) |  there is a delta such that if delta is the absolute value of etc., etc., etc. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=183) |  Sure. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=184) |  Well, anyway, that's the definition. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=186) |  That's part of the definition of the limit of a ratio that's used to define a derivative. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=194) |  In any event, it's defined with this, it's like incredibly subtle and incredibly complicated |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=202) |  and you have to read it over and over and over and over again until it finally sort |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=207) |  of registers and then after you've read it about a hundred times, it's like, oh, of course, |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=215) |  it's so natural, it's so obvious. |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=218) |  Now, what they don't tell you in your beginning calculus book and what would have helped me |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=224) |  a lot if they had told me was that that definition of the derivative was not the one that Newton, |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=233) |  who invented calculus, used. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=236) |  That was the result of generation upon generation, a good 17, 18, 19, yeah, like a good 250 years |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=250) |  after Newton of the finest mathematical minds, Euler, Gauss, Cauchy, Weierstrass. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=257) |  I know most people have never heard of these people but they're among the mathematical |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=265) |  geniuses of the Western world. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=267) |  Each one of them contributed something to that definition that the others hadn't seen. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=273) |  That is the distillation of 300 years of contention, discussion, and thinking things over, the |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=288) |  end result of which is this incredibly precise, incredibly powerful concept. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=296) |  Well, you get used to dealing with that level of precision and you get used to the notion |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=302) |  that you're going to have to really think about the definitions and read and reread |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=306) |  and reread because it's worth it because an ordinary high school student who is willing |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=319) |  to come back over and over and over again will be able to understand this as well as |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=325) |  those, better than those mathematical geniuses because their stored wisdom is there. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=331) |  I like to think of myself as on a mission to take the mist out of mysticism. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=341) |  I think it can be done. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=342) |  Mist out of mysticism. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=343) |  Yup. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=344) |  It can, using mysticism not in the sense of new age airy-fairy but in the sense of classical |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=350) |  mystical experience as exists inside the great traditions of the world, essentially contemplative |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=358) |  experience. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=359) |  I'm academically, I said that I have a good amateur's knowledge of science and math but |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=369) |  I have a professional academic trained knowledge of comparative mysticism and Asian languages |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=375) |  and Buddhist studies and so forth. |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=377) |  That was my degree in graduate school, my degree program. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=383) |  I sort of bring a very strong scholarship background because of knowing most of the |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=390) |  Asian languages in which the technologies of internal exploration of the east are encoded. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=397) |  Then I have this scientific thing which causes me to be extremely precise about how I define |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=405) |  terms. |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=406) |  People that work with me have to be willing to put up with that but it saves them a lot |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=410) |  of time in the end. |
    | [00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=411) |  How so? |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=412) |  Because they're able to eventually communicate and conceptualize the entire path to classical |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=419) |  enlightenment precisely in words. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=424) |  That's taking the mist out of mysticism. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=426) |  So you ask me what's distinctive, I bring a scholastic background. |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=431) |  I bring a science background. |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=436) |  That informs the whole way that I teach. |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=444) |  Because I have this sort of broad view of world meditative practice, I've created a |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=452) |  system that is a framework within which all of the major innovations in historical innovations |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=472) |  in the contemplative technologies from the past, all of those major innovations can be |
    | [00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=482) |  formulated within the framework that I've created. |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=485) |  I call it five ways to know yourself as a spiritual being. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=489) |  Each one of those five ways represents a distinct innovation that happened in history but I've |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=496) |  reformulated it into modern secular language and placed it all on a universal framework |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=506) |  within the mindfulness tradition. |

     I'd like to define mindfulness as a three-fold attentional skill set consisting of concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity. So to the extent that I am a quote meditation teacher, I teach concentration power because that's universal to any form of meditation. To the extent that I am a mindfulness teacher, I also emphasize the sensory clarity and the equanimity. Then there is the extent to which I sort of have my own distinctive way of going about mindfulness and that definitely has certain distinctive characteristics. A lot of it goes to my background. I have a pretty solid amateur knowledge of science and mathematics and that has informed the way that I teach mindfulness in a very, very deep way. One of the things that you learn if you get into the physical sciences or mathematics at any kind of depth is you learn habits of precision in expression and thinking. Habits of precision. Of precision. That's correct. In other words, in ordinary colloquial English, force, impulse, energy, potential, momentum, action, and so forth, they all sort of sound like the same thing and we might use them interchangeably on occasion. But in physics, each one of those words that I mentioned means something completely different and distinct. Each one is defined very, very carefully and in many cases it took centuries for that precision of language to be honed and perfected. For example, in the area of mathematics, if you take a beginning calculus class, you learn the definition of something called the derivative of a function. I remember that. You took that? I did. I don't remember. I remember those words. I don't remember what they were. You may remember some. You may remember. I remember a volume of a function but I can't remember what it was.
