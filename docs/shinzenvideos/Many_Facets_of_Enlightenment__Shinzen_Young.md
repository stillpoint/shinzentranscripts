    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=0) |  How much does the path one takes towards enlightenment affect the nature of the enlightenment? |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=19) |  The quick and easy answer is if you were to focus only on the breath and come to an enlightenment |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=27) |  experience through that, it would be essentially the same kind of experience that a person |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=35) |  would have if they did a more systematic deconstructive path or if they did a reconstructive path |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=43) |  like the Vajrayana path where you sort of create an alternate identity from scratch |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=50) |  that's archetypal. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=51) |  I would say they all take you to essentially the same type of experience. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=60) |  But having said that, the confounding factor is that although it's essentially the same |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=68) |  ballpark, enlightenment is like a many-faceted jewel. |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=73) |  There's so many different sides to it. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=76) |  So what side you're going to emphasize may slightly be influenced by what path you took, |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=85) |  but not necessarily. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=86) |  You might take a certain path there and when you get there, decide to emphasize something |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=91) |  quite different in contrast to what the path was that took you there. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=97) |  Also it unfolds with time. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=100) |  One of my teachers used to say, |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=102) |  今日の悟りは明日の間違い |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=105) |  That means today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=109) |  Not mistake in the sense of fundamental mistake, but in the sense of, well, Newtonian physics |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=117) |  is basically right, but Einstein had something to say. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=123) |  And then Richard Feynman had something else to say that built on this. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=131) |  So it's like science. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=133) |  It's many-faceted. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=134) |  So it will present itself to you over the years in different aspects. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=142) |  For example, my main teacher, Sasaki Roshi, when I met him, he was already a master's |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=148) |  master. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=149) |  I mean, he was already a senior Roshi when I first met him. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=154) |  He's now 102, 103. |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=160) |  I've known him for 25, 26 years now. |
    | [00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=165) |  Over those two and a half decades, I have seen him evolve and hone his paradigm and |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=174) |  change his emphasis. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=176) |  So he was already a master's master and he is discovering new facets of this at that |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=182) |  level. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=184) |  So I would say that the path that you take will somewhat influence how you conceptualize |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=192) |  the experience, but it's not necessarily going to constrain it in some way. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=199) |  And in fact, you may end up doing something quite different, ending up with quite a different |
    | [00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=204) |  paradigm. |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=206) |  So I would say it's a matter of depth and what facet you're choosing to emphasize, rather |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=213) |  than a matter of what technique you use to bring you to that. |
