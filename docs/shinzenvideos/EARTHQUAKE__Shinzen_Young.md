    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=0) |  Now that sounds like the wealth of the earth, meaning that it could become a major turning |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=23) |  point in the history of our species. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=29) |  We're having an earthquake. |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=31) |  Is that what that is? |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=34) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=35) |  It's my first earthquake. |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=38) |  I've been waiting 14 years. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=44) |  Well, I hope you weren't disappointed. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=51) |  That ain't much of an earthquake, baby. |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=59) |  We have some entertainment up here in Palos Verdes just for y'all for tonight. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=62) |  Thank you. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=64) |  They seem to happen on Friday nights like this. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=66) |  Our second one in about two months on a Friday night, just about this time. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=72) |  Oh no, that's great. We were enjoying it. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=76) |  Chell is having a complete experience. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=82) |  What can I say? We could do a lot better than that. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=91) |  Yeah, we don't get them on the East Coast very much, it's true. |
    | [00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=99) |  The earthquake, yes. What to do when the earthquake comes. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=109) |  Well, there's a Zen koan. |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=116) |  Anyone care to answer? What to do when the earthquake comes. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=121) |  That's the explanation. Or the manifestation. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=129) |  My explanation would be you can't shake the shaking. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=137) |  But permanence, complete experience, actually does feel like an earthquake. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=145) |  That earthquake was on cue for me. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=149) |  At least I'm going to interpret it that way. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=153) |  I was just about to say that when you have a completed experience, |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=158) |  it feels like an earthquake. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=161) |  It shakes heaven and earth because it is the authentic person without a fixed position. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=172) |  I wasn't going to relate it to an earthquake. |
    | [00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=178) |  But it is a reasonable comparison and one, in fact, that I have made numerous times in the past. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=188) |  One of the times when I knew that this practice was really doing something industrial strength for me |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=200) |  was when we had the center, some of you were around back that far, on Eldon Avenue, remember, in Koreatown. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=209) |  One morning I had to go in to do something that I'd forgotten. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=220) |  I had gotten in my car and then I said, oh, I forgot to do that. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=225) |  I ran into the center and I left the keys in the car. |
    | [00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=232) |  It's downtown, right? |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=235) |  And sure enough, like two minutes later I came out, the car is gone. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=244) |  And what was that experience? |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=247) |  I'm remembering it because at the time it was just like an earthquake. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=254) |  That's all. There was no thought, there was no emotion as an object. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=260) |  It was so complete that it was just space rocking. |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=266) |  It was just like that last penultimate scene in the first Matrix when... |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=279) |  What's the name of the character? |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=281) |  Neo. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=283) |  Neo, yeah, Neo realizes who he is, right? |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=290) |  And the whole frame of the movie sort of goes like that. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=298) |  I mean, that's really what it was like. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=300) |  It wasn't just my mind and my body, it was the sight and sound, everything. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=306) |  The whole frame of the self and scene was just this wave. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=314) |  And then it was just like being massaged. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=320) |  And then I just went in, called the cops, and that was that, you know, reported it. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=327) |  That was dramatic. |
    | [00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=329) |  That was a complete experience of having your car swiped in downtown L.A. |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=339) |  The gangbangers that took it were so stupid, they put their graffiti in it. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=347) |  And the cops busted them. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=351) |  I eventually got the car back. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=355) |  Left the graffiti just for the cultural. |
