    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=0) |  What if you don't have any concentration? I know it helps build it, but what if you |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=11) |  don't even have enough to stay, keep your focus there for five seconds? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=18) |  Well, everybody has to start somewhere. If you think of the analogy to a workout, |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=29) |  if you've never worked out, the very first time you work out, you get winded in like |
    | [00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=36) |  two minutes, right? And it's like, oh my God, at this rate, I'll never get anywhere. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=42) |  What you don't realize is that the growth is not linear. It's somewhat hockey stick, |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=51) |  so that you grow faster as you grow more. So it's true initially that you might very |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=60) |  well have the experience that you're describing, which is just like, I'll never get this because |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=66) |  I, you know, it's like I'm here 1% of the time and 99% of the time I'm like lost in |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=76) |  ruminations and worrying about, you know, body sensations, sounds, memory, plan, fantasy. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=85) |  That's my memory, plan, fantasy, reaction, judgment. When I decided I was going to like, |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=92) |  okay, I'm going to be healthy, I'm going to run. So I was 21 years old, but I'd never |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=97) |  really worked out or done anything. I ran down the block and at the end of the block, |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=101) |  I'm like, and it's like, oh my God, I mean, I'll never be able to run more than a block. |
    | [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=109) |  But within two months, I was running miles, right? It was a dramatic change. So initially, |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=117) |  yes, you may have to put up with that. But everyone has to start somewhere. Another way |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=123) |  to look at it is if you never start, then you'll have to live your entire life in a |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=129) |  scattered state, an unrecollected state, as the Christians would say. You know, I quoted |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=135) |  T.S. Eliot before. He's got this great phrase where he says, this is a place of disaffection, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=147) |  meaning ordinary experience, right? This is a place of disaffection. Then he goes on and |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=153) |  eventually says, distracted from distraction by distraction. People are so distracted, |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=159) |  they don't even realize they're distracted. So distracted from distraction by distraction. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=166) |  That's how you're going to have to live your whole life and it's going to be time to die |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=169) |  really quick. And then you will not have lived and you'll freak out. So you've got to start |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=176) |  somewhere. So the bad news is, yes, you might have to put up with what you're describing |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=182) |  for a while, like getting a stitch when you first try to work out, but things get better |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=188) |  with practice. If you don't do something like that, you'll basically just live your life |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=196) |  just in that distracted state, meaning you won't really live your life. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=200) |  Meaning you're not focusing on what's relevant back to your concentration model? |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=207) |  Exactly. You can either say, oh my God, this is awful. I'm able to focus 10% of the time |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=216) |  and 90% of the time I'm away. So you can make that a problem or you can make that an insight. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=223) |  You can realize, oh, this is how most people live. This is how I would have lived otherwise. |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=231) |  So you're never really being present. You're spending the present thinking about the past |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=236) |  and the future. Essentially, that's the human condition at |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=240) |  least at this point in history. What that means is that people don't fully live each |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=249) |  moment and therefore they don't really live. If you discover when you first attempt to |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=256) |  meditate that it's nine to one, one unit of focus versus nine unit of distraction, that |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=267) |  means that you're missing 90% of your life. That's the bad news. When it comes time |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=274) |  to die, you won't have lived and you'll freak out. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=277) |  On the other hand, the good news is with practice, you can get it reversed. |
    | [00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=282) |  Does it take two months like it did for you to run two miles? |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=285) |  No, it takes longer typically. Six months to a year of regular practice. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=291) |  What's regular? I would say 10 minutes each day and at least |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=295) |  four hours of intensive continuous practice per month. That's why I have the home practice |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=300) |  program so people can call by phone wherever they are in the world. |
    | [00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=304) |  Oh, I was going to ask you about that later. Maybe we should finish up this one thought. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=309) |  The bad news is that you may have what might be called a sobering realization when you |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=317) |  first try to meditate, which is it's like I say, it's 90% of the time I'm unable |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=328) |  to focus. Well, with enough practice, you can eventually reverse that. You're 90% focused. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=340) |  You've basically multiplied your ability to be present by a factor of nine. That means |
    | [00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=350) |  you get to live life nine times as big as the average human being. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=355) |  When it comes time to die, you will have participated enough in life that you won't freak out. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=363) |  You will have completed your life activity. If I were to tell a person, hey, give me 10 |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=370) |  minutes each day, subtract 10 minutes each day from your life and every month subtract |
    | [00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=376) |  four hours and keep that up for the duration and you'll be able to live to be 300 years |
    | [00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=386) |  old. Well, that would be something like amazing, right? |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=393) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=394) |  That's not possible. You can't add 100 and 200 and however many years to a person's |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=403) |  life. However, what you can do is multiply your ability to be present in each moment |
    | [00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=412) |  and you can do that dramatically. As the result of that, you'll get to live life two, three, |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=418) |  four times as big as you would otherwise. The effect will be the same richness as though |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=426) |  you live to be 100, 200 or 300. That's actually doable by anyone. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=432) |  Formal meditation practice subtracts a little bit of time from your life, but it multiplies |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=438) |  the richness and depth of the rest of the time. As we say, do the math. It's a good |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=445) |  deal. |
