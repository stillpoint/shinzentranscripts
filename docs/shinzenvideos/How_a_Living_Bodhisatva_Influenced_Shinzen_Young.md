    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=0) |  Some of you know, some of you actually knew Nicola Geiger before she passed away. |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=14) |  So this is a woman that I met in Japan who was German and had lived through World War |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=26) |  II as part of the resistance to the Nazis. |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=32) |  They even made a movie about the group called The White Rose. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=37) |  So she had to go, it was like Schindler's List, you know, I mean, she lived it. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=42) |  She was only 20 years old at the time. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=45) |  And she'd just been through everything. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=47) |  I mean, she'd been tortured, interrogated, raped, you name it. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=52) |  It had happened many times. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=60) |  So I met up with her. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=65) |  I didn't know who she was or whatever. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=71) |  But she said, well, if you ever come to Kyoto, come visit me. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=77) |  She was running Friends World College, which is a Quaker college that has campuses all |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=83) |  over the world. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=84) |  And she was interestingly engaged, she worked for Amnesty International. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=89) |  She was in fact their specialist on human rights violations in South Korea, which at |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=97) |  that time was very bad on human rights violations. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=102) |  And she was actually like, it was like this, it was very cinematic. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=110) |  I mean, she was engaged in like secret espionage stuff because she was trying to save the life |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=118) |  of Kim Dae-jung. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=119) |  Now, you may or may not know the whole story, but eventually Kim Dae-jung became the president |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=126) |  of South Korea and Korea became democratized. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=130) |  But he was in prison at that time. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=133) |  And she was doing all sorts of stuff with Amnesty International to make sure that he |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=139) |  didn't get killed. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=142) |  So she was like, you know, you would think someone that had been through that themselves |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=147) |  would want to sort of distance themselves, right? |
    | [00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=152) |  But no. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=153) |  Anyway. |
    | [00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=154) |  So how this relates to challenges and what have you is, so she says, come visit me if |
    | [00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=164) |  you're ever in Kyoto. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=170) |  So I was in Kyoto, I came to visit her. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=173) |  And she said, come up to my living room here. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=179) |  Sit down. |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=181) |  Do you know why I invited you to come here? |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=187) |  I said, no. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=190) |  And then she proceeded to tell me exactly where I was at in meditation and what I needed |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=199) |  to do to take the next step. |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=203) |  That was sort of surprising. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=205) |  But then later on, after I knew her story, she had been trained to meditate from the |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=212) |  time that she was three years old. |
    | [00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=217) |  Her father had been a meditator and they were associated with Hermann Hesse and the League |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=231) |  of the Journeyers to the East and this whole group of Europeans that were interested in |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=237) |  sort of Buddhist kinds of things during the Weimar Republic. |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=243) |  Anyway so I mean she'd been trained, that's why she survived all that stuff and prospered. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=250) |  She had enlightenment experiences while these horrible things were going on to her. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=259) |  So eventually it became evident why she had this perspicacity to see through you, literally. |
    | [00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=270) |  So anyway, apropos of challenge, what she pointed out to me was that I didn't like people |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=276) |  and that I withdrew from people and that I was going to have to learn to like being around |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=285) |  people. |
    | [00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=290) |  It was true. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=291) |  I had spent my entire life as a loner. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=294) |  I was very uncomfortable around people. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=306) |  What I have in her was a role model for what she was talking about. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=311) |  She was the first role model. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=313) |  Later on I had others. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=317) |  But what did she do? |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=320) |  Well she just hung out in her house and people would come to be with her. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=331) |  What kind of people? |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=333) |  Every kind of person. |
    | [00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=336) |  The entire spectrum of humanity. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=342) |  From the best to the worst. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=347) |  The best being the Zen masters and Catholic priests. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=354) |  She was friends with Father Johnston, for example. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=359) |  And the worst being Yakuza, if you know what that is. |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=365) |  And left wing international terrorists, like the real deal. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=375) |  And everything in between would pass through her living room and she would give each one |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=387) |  of them what they needed. |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=390) |  So that was a big change in my habit patterns, that I had to learn to love to be around people |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=397) |  and be with people. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=399) |  It might not seem like that big a deal, but that was a challenge. |
