    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=0) |  So, the topic was the pros and cons of Dharma maps. Maps that sort of map out, okay, here |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=21) |  is the state. I think you were mostly thinking of stages. It's like you go through these |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=27) |  stages and this is what happens and then this happens and this happens. So, there are all |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=34) |  these maps. So, what's the pros and cons in general of having these maps and what's the |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=42) |  pros and cons of this map versus that map kind of thing. I'm assuming that's... |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=47) |  The one I like is Mahasi's. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=49) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=50) |  The progress of insight. |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=51) |  And I was afraid of that because that was what I would have gone to the Wikipedia and |
    | [00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=59) |  come all prepared to make comparisons and contrasts, but then again I would have missed |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=67) |  my body work. So, maybe I'll have time tomorrow. There's 16 of them, right? 16 stages, I think. |
    | [00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=75) |  And I have a vague recollection, but I'm not going to pontificate based on that vague recollection. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=82) |  I have a map in my computer. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=85) |  Yes. I also have to think about it. Okay, but I can probably say a few things broadly |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=94) |  on this issue. Many years ago, the Kuroda Institute, which is an academic Buddhist study |
    | [00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=104) |  institute associated with the Zen Center of LA, had an entire seminar where they invited |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=114) |  Buddhist scholars to present papers on stages and maps throughout the Buddhist world. And |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=124) |  I tried to find it online. I couldn't. I think it would be really cool if anybody wants to |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=130) |  see if that was ever published or is available someplace or other similar scholarly collections |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=141) |  where this issue is discussed in its full breadth and depth. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=147) |  I would, but I've got body work with Diane. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=150) |  Say what? |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=151) |  I've got body work with Diane. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=153) |  I think you made the right decision. The map is not the journey. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=166) |  So you decided to make the journey. So this is good. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=172) |  Now, Buddhism broadly is three vehicles. And then within that, there's a gazillion other |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=179) |  divisions. It's 2,500 years and half the world and now the whole world. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=189) |  And Buddhism is just a subset of world mysticism anyway. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=193) |  So broadly, if we're going to talk about maps and that kind of thing, we really should frame |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=201) |  Buddhism within the larger context of world contemplative practice. So it's a huge and |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=210) |  very rich question that you bring up. So let me just start blabbering and we'll see what |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=218) |  comes up. First, I'd like to share my own experience. Well, actually not. Before we |
    | [00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=224) |  do that, so three vehicles, numerous subdivisions, and that's just a subset of what's worldwide. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=233) |  So within Buddhism, what do we have? Well, let's see. We have the ten observing pictures. |
    | [00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=240) |  That's my most popular YouTube presentation, which tells you that people are really in |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=246) |  the stages and what have you. And that's used in Zen. But see, here's the deal. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=253) |  There's different versions of the ten. There's one that has eight. So this already tells |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=259) |  us that it's not exactly constrained to exactly ten. What else is there? Well, there's the |
    | [00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=266) |  one that I frequently use myself, which is the four classes of noble individuals, the |
    | [00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=274) |  four Aryabhugala. These are maps for a lifetime of practice. This is really big picture stuff. |
    | [00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=286) |  Sota, Apana, Sakadagami, Anagami, Araha. So that's stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=295) |  and worthy, if I were to translate these into English. Over a lifetime of practice or in |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=303) |  traditional belief, over lifetimes of practice, you pass through these four stages. But then |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=311) |  there's the stages of insight, which are like 16 stages that precede stream entry, I believe. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=319) |  So it's like, oh, it's all this fine subdivision. And then there's the four jhanas, the eight |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=326) |  jhanas, the nine jhanas, which are not exactly paths to enlightenment, but they're definitely |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=333) |  demarcations and are related. So the Chinese have their ox-herding pictures. The Tibetans |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=345) |  have their elephant-herding pictures. And there are various stages. And some of those |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=351) |  elephant-herding pictures look an awful lot like some of the versions of the ox-herding |
    | [00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=356) |  pictures. And since, once again, remember that Eastern Tibet and Western China are the |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=363) |  same place, so we're not surprised that there would be interactions there, even though the |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=373) |  political concerns of those two cultures don't like to, well, they definitely both have axes |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=382) |  to grind with regards to history. And that can sort of get in the way. What else is there? |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=389) |  Well, there are the ten bodhisattva stages. And then there are Tozan's five degrees, and |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=401) |  I'm pretty sure there's a five-stage, one five-stage model that's prominent in the Kargyu |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=410) |  lineage. I could be wrong about this. You get the general idea here. There's a lot. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=416) |  So now I'll tell you my own story. I started out not as a Buddhist practitioner, but as |
    | [00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=427) |  a Buddhist scholar. And actually, I'm very glad that I had that academic background and |
    | [00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=433) |  that training. And it was serious graduate-level training that involved mastering a half-dozen |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=442) |  languages of Asia and reading these things in the original languages, etc., etc. So I'm |
    | [00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=451) |  glad I had that background. But in some ways, well, I remember when I was in the Zen temple |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=459) |  in Japan when I started, one of the senior monks there said, because I could really impress |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=469) |  them, I mean, I knew classical Chinese and Sanskrit. He said, someday all your learning |
    | [00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=478) |  will be very useful. Someday in the distant future, when you're in a position to teach, |
    | [00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=485) |  it's going to be really, really good that you know all this stuff academically. But |
    | [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=491) |  right now, it's like totally getting in the way of your practice. And he was totally right. |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=502) |  So what happened to me was I spent, I would say, at least 15 years, the first 15 years |
    | [00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=511) |  of my practice, torturing myself with regards to where am I at on these maps. Have I experienced |
    | [00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=523) |  this yet? And then it was actually like literally torture. It was like if I read some classic |
    | [00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=534) |  thing, it's like, oh my God, there's a stage I haven't heard of even. What to say of achieved? |
    | [00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=540) |  I never even heard of this one. Well, that's another one to put on the list of I'll never |
    | [00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=545) |  be anywhere until I experience X, Y, and Z. And I mean, it was horrible. It was like for |
    | [00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=553) |  me, because there was so much grasping around the notion of I got to get somewhere and I |
    | [00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=560) |  got to get these signs and there's all of these things to do. Well, fortunately, eventually |
    | [00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=567) |  I grew up and grew out of that. But that is one of the dangers of having these maps. Okay, |
    | [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=576) |  we're going to talk about pros and cons. I'm certainly going to talk about pros, but there's |
    | [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=581) |  certain cons. One of them is that you get very concerned with rating. And of course |
    | [00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=593) |  that just links into the whole thing that when did it start? The sixth grade, kindergarten, |
    | [00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=603) |  certainly by middle school, by high school, it's all about mate and rate, right? So it's |
    | [00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=610) |  status. And so it links into all of that stuff, et cetera, et cetera. The other possible con |
    | [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=621) |  about these maps is what I was talking about, which I briefly alluded to, which is putting |
    | [00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=635) |  an inordinate amount of time and energy and emotional investment in the maps or the quest, |
    | [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=644) |  the map quest, the quest for the right map. Time and energy that is therefore not devoted |
    | [00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=653) |  to practice. So if you go on the internet, most Buddhist time and energy on the internet |
    | [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=661) |  is being spent in contention about who's got the right map. You don't know whether to laugh |
    | [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=670) |  or cry because there's people that are interested in making the journey are not interested by |
    | [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=682) |  and large in debating about who's got the right map by and large because there's only |
    | [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=695) |  so much time and energy. And the trap is, well, I don't want to start to make the journey |
    | [00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=701) |  until I'm sure that this is the very best, right? Because I don't want to be like not |
    | [00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=709) |  doing the very best. And then what happens is that years pass and people just study and |
    | [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=719) |  argue and study and argue and study and argue. So what I find useful, although I know to |
    | [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=729) |  say this is offensive and confusing perhaps, but I myself take great comfort in the notion |
    | [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=740) |  which I alluded to briefly and has already annoyed people, the notion that actually none |
    | [00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=749) |  of these maps really work very well by my standards of what I would call work very well, |
    | [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=759) |  meaning that I know enough based on my own personal experience as a professional meditation |
    | [00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=769) |  teacher and as a pretty good dilettante scientist, I know enough to know that we can do a lot |
    | [00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=781) |  better with regards to making enlightenment available to great masses of people. By we |
    | [00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=792) |  I mean humanity and I mean in the next few centuries. It will take a combination of three |
    | [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=804) |  things, deep practice, a scientific mentality, and out-of-the-box creativity. But there will |
    | [00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=817) |  be people, probably dozens, maybe hundreds of people in the future that bring these three |
    | [00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=827) |  things together. And it seems to me not unreasonable that they will come up with things that change |
    | [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=839) |  the course of human history, that dramatically change the course of human history. All of |
    | [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=846) |  the maps and methodologies that we now have essentially are based on one approach, which |
    | [00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=856) |  is introspection. An individual looks within, discovers certain things, and creates a formulation |
    | [00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=867) |  based on that. Often based in part on what they've learned from the past, usually taking |
    | [00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=879) |  some parts of that, rebelling against other parts, and often creating something new that |
    | [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=887) |  wasn't there before. Some combination of accepting the past, rebelling against the past, and |
    | [00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=896) |  innovation. Then a new model, a new path arises, but it's still based on an individual's introspection. |
    | [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=907) |  And it's pretty good. When I say they're all relatively ineffective, I just mean that it |
    | [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=922) |  takes a very long time. And most people are not, most human beings are just not willing |
    | [00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=931) |  to put the time and energy like you and I are into this path. So what is lacking is |
    | [00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=947) |  an objective view of what's going on, a view based on hard science and evidence. What is |
    | [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=956) |  also lacking is true collaborative dialogue among the masters, and among the masters and |
    | [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=967) |  their students. The great, right now the great masters, most of them are old fashioned, old |
    | [00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=979) |  Asians, with whom which you cannot communicate in an open peer to peer kind of dialogue. |
    | [00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=990) |  They won't do it with you as a student, it's just not on their cultural radar. And they |
    | [00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=997) |  won't do it among each other either, because there's just too much at stake. So they're |
    | [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1005) |  not like scientists. In science, there could be a Nobel laureate up there, talking about |
    | [00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1015) |  something, and I could be a graduate student. And I could get up and I could say you're |
    | [00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1023) |  wrong because of this, this, this and this. And if I'm right, if I've got evidence to |
    | [00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1032) |  back it up, then that's it. It's over. Even though I'm just a no one that no one's ever |
    | [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1046) |  heard of, and this guy's got a Nobel Prize, he was wrong. I pointed out something. That |
    | [00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1053) |  kind of thing, that doesn't happen in the context of meditation teaching. But I think |
    | [00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1061) |  it will as things become more modern and more Western. You start to have really frank dialoguing |
    | [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1071) |  among the masters and among the masters and their students. So the combination of turning |
    | [00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1079) |  the lens of science towards it, plus really being willing to discuss things, specifically |
    | [00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1090) |  to look at each other's maps and discuss in an open way, what's this, what's this. |
    | [00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1098) |  No, I don't quite think it works that way, etc. etc. That will probably happen in the |
    | [00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1103) |  future. Now, of course, when I say that in general they don't work well based on what |
    | [00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1112) |  I think will eventually replace them in the future, don't get me wrong. Relative to not |
    | [00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1123) |  using these maps, relative to not doing this practice, well, forget about that. The alternative |
    | [00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1131) |  to what we now have is horrific. The alternative to not doing it. So, you know, it's good that |
    | [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1142) |  we have this. I just think we can, we meaning humanity, can potentially do a lot better. |
    | [00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1150) |  So, okay, so what should we think about, what should we, how should we think about these maps? |
    | [00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1161) |  Well, I pointed out some of the cons. Let's talk about some of the pros. They can give |
    | [00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1170) |  you an idea of where to go, what to look for. They can give you an idea of what's optimal |
    | [00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1179) |  to do when various things occur. That's really useful. They can motivate you. It's like, |
    | [00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1189) |  well, why do it if there's not goodies at the end? Or in the middle? Or even maybe in |
    | [00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1197) |  the beginning? So, you can be motivated by this and you can be informed by it so you |
    | [00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1203) |  know what to look for. So that's good. They are based, at least in part, on real people's |
    | [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1218) |  real experience. And those are by and large real people with very, very deep experience. |
    | [00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1226) |  So, people with very, very deep experience, that's something we need to pay attention |
    | [00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1238) |  to. However, it is also important to realize that not everything that appears in those |
    | [00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1245) |  maps is necessarily a deep person's deep experience. Because other factors enter into the creation |
    | [00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1255) |  of these things. What are some other factors? Well, some master a thousand years ago might |
    | [00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1269) |  have said some things to a student. But they didn't write it down. When that student wrote |
    | [00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1281) |  it down, well, that student's ideas are there mixed with that master's ideas. Perhaps there's |
    | [00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1290) |  speculations. So you cannot be sure that you're getting the ipsit-dixit, the very words that |
    | [00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1298) |  were said. Furthermore, these things were usually written by hand, not printed. Printing |
    | [00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1307) |  is... well, Chinese had printing a long time ago, but they were written by hand, so you |
    | [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1312) |  get scribal error. So if you start to get all fundamentalist about exactly what's there, |
    | [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1322) |  you know, it must be exactly that way. Well, it just might be some scribal error. Also, |
    | [00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1334) |  because of the authoritarian nature of these cultures, there's a need to make your innovations |
    | [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1343) |  appear to agree with scripture. So there can be a forcing, where it's like forced onto |
    | [00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1353) |  a certain model that has been passed down. All of these, therefore, give us our caveats, |
    | [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1363) |  not to get fundamentalist about what's literally there. On the other hand, as I said, by and |
    | [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1373) |  large, these are important experiences of deep masters. And so there's really something |
    | [00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1381) |  to learn. The Buddha said that there are three epistemological bases. Epistemology means |
    | [00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1396) |  the investigation of how we know, how we gain valid knowledge. So in ancient Greece it was |
    | [00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1404) |  the same, in ancient India it was the same. There's three bases. Direct experience, logical |
    | [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1411) |  inference, and reliable authority. Now, the Buddha rejected reliable authority. He said |
    | [00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1423) |  base yourself on direct experience and on logical inference. But the fact is, maybe |
    | [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1433) |  the fact is that consulting with an expert is a good idea. But there's a difference |
    | [00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1444) |  between consulting with an expert and reading something that was written, hopefully, by |
    | [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1454) |  an expert a thousand years ago, but may have other things that have entered in there. Because |
    | [00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1462) |  when you consult with an authority, you can dialogue. But when you've got a text that |
    | [00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1473) |  has come down to you, you can't dialogue with the person that wrote that text. So the |
    | [00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1479) |  good news is that there's probably stuff in there that is hugely valuable. The other news |
    | [00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1486) |  is, though, that we can't, we can only, it's a very one-sided communication. It's not like |
    | [00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1496) |  when you hire a consultant and you say, you know, this person knows what they're talking |
    | [00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1501) |  about, so let's see what their opinion is and then you can ask questions, etc. So those |
    | [00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1512) |  are some of the pros and cons of having these maps. I myself don't have a map. I don't |
    | [00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1534) |  say that you'll pass through certain stages and delineate what those stages are. But I |
    | [00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1548) |  do give you some general trends. I say that over time you're going to notice an elevation |
    | [00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1556) |  in your concentration, clarity and equanimity. And that's going to have some pretty dramatic |
    | [00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1563) |  effects on your life. So I like to talk more along those lines. Yet inevitably we want |
    | [00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1576) |  to know that we're making progress in some way or another. So I will give you four criteria |
    | [00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1585) |  that you can use to judge your progress. Starting with the least, what would I say? Starting |
    | [00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1599) |  with, each of these criteria is valid, but there's a hierarchy of maturity. I'm going |
    | [00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1609) |  to end with the most mature. So that means I'm going to begin with the least mature, |
    | [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1615) |  but you don't have to take that as a put-down. The least mature criteria is, during periods |
    | [00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1623) |  of practice I have experiences that are unusual, interesting, fun, entertaining, and so forth. |
    | [00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1632) |  An awful lot of people, for an awful lot of people that is the criteria. If you want to |
    | [00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1641) |  sell spirituality, you sell entertainment. But I'm not saying that that's completely |
    | [00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1651) |  without validity. Because if fun and interesting and unusual things happen, then that's going |
    | [00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1660) |  to motivate you to keep practicing. So from that perspective, that's fine. The only problem |
    | [00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1667) |  is, I don't care who you are or who your teacher is or what you're doing, it ain't going to |
    | [00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1675) |  always be fun and interesting and entertaining and have unusual things happen. So then when |
    | [00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1686) |  it's the opposite of all those, if you hold out these criteria of fun, interesting, unusual, |
    | [00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1695) |  entertaining, then when the opposite of those happen for a period of time, which could be |
    | [00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1702) |  perhaps a long period of time, then it's to hell with meditation. You don't want to do |
    | [00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1710) |  it anymore. So, that's one criteria, because have fun if you can. A little bit more mature |
    | [00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1720) |  is during a formal period of practice, you can actually taste mindfulness. You can taste |
    | [00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1728) |  concentration, clarity, and equanimity right while you're doing the practice. And each |
    | [00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1735) |  one of them has its own taste, its distinctive reward taste. And it's a mature palate. You |
    | [00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1743) |  learn how to taste that. There's just a taste of being concentrated. And as Mike Chixentli |
    | [00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1752) |  Hai pointed out, that's an intrinsic reward just to being concentrated. Doesn't matter |
    | [00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1761) |  what you're concentrated on, independent of the particular focus. Hence, you could be |
    | [00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1770) |  doing a god awful boring task, like licking stamps or the archetypal nun task is stepping |
    | [00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1785) |  out communion wafers, okay? You know, like hours and hours every day just making these |
    | [00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1792) |  communion wafers. Okay, now, I would suggest to you that that is either heaven or hell, |
    | [00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1798) |  depending on how recollected you are. Recollected is the Catholic word for Samadhi. So, if you're |
    | [00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1807) |  tasting, like Shelley, some of you know Shelley Young. So, before she became a really impressive |
    | [00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1819) |  psychotherapist back when we were kids, she used to do temp jobs. And it was literally |
    | [00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1828) |  like licking envelopes, right? Putting stamps on it, whatever. So, she'd go to these temp |
    | [00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1833) |  jobs and there would be other temp workers doing this. And as the day progressed, you |
    | [00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1844) |  could see their moods deteriorate, okay? They were just like, by the end of the day, they |
    | [00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1850) |  were just like, you know, not doing a very good thing. But she would just get higher |
    | [00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1856) |  and higher and higher, right? Because it was Samud, it was Karma Yoga, it was a tasted |
    | [00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1866) |  concentration, Samadhi, the rest of it, the taste of Samadhi was there all day. So, I |
    | [00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1872) |  mean, she left and she was just like, you know, she's doing this shit job, pardon my |
    | [00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1878) |  French. But the more shit job it is, the actually easier it is to meditate, in that sense, right? |
    | [00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1885) |  The simpler. So, you know, with that taste of concentration. So, and the clarity has |
    | [00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1894) |  its own taste and the equanimity is the taste of release and catharsis of purification. |
    | [00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1900) |  So, yes, if you can actually taste those things while you're doing formal practice, then, |
    | [00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1908) |  yeah, that's good, that's a sign of progress. But what about when you can't taste those |
    | [00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1916) |  things? Because that's going to happen. Why? You can go for years with very deep states |
    | [00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1923) |  of mindfulness, but then either something happens in the external world that's pretty |
    | [00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1931) |  challenging or nothing's happening in the external world, but it's just time for the |
    | [00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1938) |  next layer of stored material to release. And suddenly it seems as though you're back |
    | [00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1945) |  to square one. You can't focus, it's just like everything is surface, it's like I never |
    | [00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1951) |  meditated before. Now, you're not really back to square one, the clock is not pointing to |
    | [00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1959) |  where you started, okay? Many days have passed, okay? It's not the same day, even though it |
    | [00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1966) |  seems like the clock is still pointing to, you know, twelve o'clock or what have you. |
    | [00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1971) |  But it seems that way. So, you're not going to have those reward flavors. So, then what? |
    | [00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1978) |  Well, if that's all that you use to judge your practice with, then you're not going |
    | [00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1983) |  to be meditating. So, what's the next mature, more mature criterion is not now linked to |
    | [00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1994) |  what I experienced during formal practice. It's linked to the long-term effects of the |
    | [00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2000) |  practice in daily life. It's possible you might not have anything unusual or entertaining |
    | [00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2007) |  during the practice. It's possible that you might not even taste concentration, clarity |
    | [00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2018) |  or equanimity individually or collectively. But you notice there's a trend in daily life |
    | [00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2026) |  as you're sort of popping around in the world with regards to five things. One or a combination |
    | [00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2038) |  of the following five. Less suffering, more fulfillment, insights, understandings about |
    | [00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2051) |  things that sort of happen, either personal or transpersonal, improvements in your behavior |
    | [00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2061) |  and a kind of sense of love and service for humanity, a disappearing of that fundamental |
    | [00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2074) |  alienation that separates inside and outside. And along with that, a sense of a larger identity |
    | [00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2084) |  that it is your privilege to serve. If in one or a combination of these, it can just |
    | [00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2094) |  be one, often it's reduced suffering. It's not necessarily the whole list. But if in |
    | [00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2100) |  any of these areas you're noticing improvements and it seems to be linked to the practice, |
    | [00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2107) |  then we say that you're making progress and the practice is working. |
    | [00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2119) |  The most mature criteria is to just do the practice and not really, you just do the practice, |
    | [00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2130) |  you do the practice and you're not really thinking that much about the goals. As Maezumi |
    | [00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2138) |  once said, when asked directly, what is satori? What is enlightenment? He said, |
    | [00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2145) |  satori to satori de nai to no kubetsu ga naku naru koto deshou. I think you could say that |
    | [00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2154) |  satori, enlightenment, is the passing away of the distinction between enlightenment |
    | [00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2161) |  and non-enlightenment, which is a very empowering statement in a lot of different ways. |
    | [00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2173) |  So you might say that how far away are you from enlightenment would be measured in exactly |
    | [00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2188) |  how much you identify with the moment by moment arising of the conviction, I'm not enlightened |
    | [00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2200) |  and I won't be. So the length of time between where you're at now and enlightenment is no |
    | [00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2210) |  longer than the length of that thought, I'm not enlightened, depending on your relationship |
    | [00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2217) |  to that thought each time it comes up. So, very fast path to enlightenment, have a complete |
    | [00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2229) |  experience of the belief that you're not enlightened. Now you understand a complete experience, |
    | [00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2236) |  I described a complete experience. Complete experience is a paradoxical experience. It's |
    | [00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2243) |  infinitely full and absolutely vacuous at the same time. Okay, so, here's a, let's see, |
    | [00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2263) |  I wrote down, I did actually write down a couple of things. Okay. What does that say? |
    | [00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2279) |  Okay. It's in Chinese. Okay, so here are some common beliefs about the maps that people |
    | [00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2298) |  have and that don't agree with my experience. I just say it that way. One very common belief |
    | [00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2313) |  is that there's this thing called enlightenment and before it happens to you, you're messed |
    | [00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2322) |  up and after it happens to you, everything is perfect. Now, you know, when we say it |
    | [00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2332) |  that way, we sort of like laugh and well, no one's that naive, but actually this notion |
    | [00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2339) |  is deep down in people, okay, because I see it. It's like, even though we say that like, |
    | [00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2351) |  even if we use the Theravada model, okay, and we say enlightenment is stream entry, |
    | [00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2356) |  what is, well, there's like three more steps, right? And although it may seem from pututjana |
    | [00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2366) |  to ariya, to a street, to a sotapanna. Pututjana means you're not there yet, okay, means, literally |
    | [00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2376) |  means an ordinary person, okay, pututjana. So from pututjana to sotapanna seems very |
    | [00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2384) |  far, I know, but sotapanna to araha, that distance, that's really far, okay. Stream |
    | [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2399) |  enters all over the place, all over the place. Arahas, I mean, I've met a few that probably |
    | [00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2412) |  were or could have been if they wanted to be, Sasaki Roshi could be if he wanted to |
    | [00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2418) |  be, I'm not sure he wants to be an araha. Well, you say, well, wait, that doesn't make |
    | [00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2424) |  any sense. But when you're that enlightened, the difference between enlightenment and non-enlightenment |
    | [00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2430) |  goes away, okay. So we can't really fathom the decisions of people like that. You look |
    | [00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2438) |  at the classical path and you see the descriptions of what arahas are supposed to be like, well, |
    | [00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2445) |  Sasaki Roshi's not that way, okay, but you sense he could be that way if he wanted to. |
    | [00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2451) |  He just doesn't want to sever the connection to humanity. That's called the bodhisattva. |
    | [00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2458) |  I mean, the ones that I've met from Southeast Asia, like Thamphu Luseda, you can find him |
    | [00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2464) |  on the internet, okay. You can actually get videos of the Thamphu Luseda. He was a reputed |
    | [00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2471) |  araha. 20, 30 years ago, how long ago, I don't remember. Remember, some of you can remember |
    | [00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2481) |  when I was downtown at CMC in Koreatown, at my own center there. Yeah, Charlie, Judy, |
    | [00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2487) |  go back that far. You remember? Yeah, you do remember. I remember picking you guys up |
    | [00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2493) |  at the station downtown. |
    | [00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2496) |  I remember learning to meditate with that ice cream truck, too. |
    | [00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2501) |  Oh, yeah. The ice cream truck and the schizophrenic derelicts and the mariachi on one side and |
    | [00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2508) |  the Sino-Vietnamese opera on the other side. To say nothing of the gunshots and the turf |
    | [00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2517) |  wars of the drug dealers fighting on the front lawn. We're killing you, Araha! And we're |
    | [00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2524) |  actually there meditating. Yeah, that was, that's the center I used to have. It was like |
    | [00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2534) |  amazing. New Year's? Ah! New Year's in El Barrio. It's the Battle of the Bulge. Guns |
    | [00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2546) |  everywhere. I mean, automatic weapons. So, you know this thing of sitting, sitting until |
    | [00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2554) |  midnight? It's so tame now. You know, it's really like very anti-climactic for me. Like, |
    | [00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2564) |  last night, was it last night? The night before, whatever. You know, hit the bell here, I heard |
    | [00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2572) |  maybe a firework somewhere. You don't even hear people go, ah! You know, because we're |
    | [00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2578) |  just too far away from things. But when we were down at the community meditation center |
    | [00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2584) |  downtown, we did the thing. I've been doing the sit, you know, the chant, the om mani |
    | [00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2590) |  padme, and then we ring the bell exactly at midnight. I've been doing that for like 40 |
    | [00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2595) |  years or something. Well, down there, it would start like maybe a minute before you know |
    | [00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2606) |  the bell was going to ring because, okay, because the gunshots would start. And then |
    | [00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2612) |  it would just reach this crescendo. It would end on all sides. And you could actually see |
    | [00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2618) |  the tracer bullets going out, okay, out the window. I think it's illegal now, right? |
    | [00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2626) |  To shoot off guns. I thought it was illegal then. And so then you hit the bell, right? |
    | [00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2634) |  And then there would just be this firestorm of rounds going off in all directions. But |
    | [00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2643) |  anyway, back in those days, which had their charm, but I'm sure glad we grew out of that. |
    | [00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2654) |  But back in those days, when I give classes, there would be four or five people. It was |
    | [00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2664) |  a pretty small operation. So one of my residents, just before, I used to do this thing on Monday |
    | [00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2672) |  where people would come. So one of my residents calls me up and he says, |
    | [00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2684) |  Taunpulu Sayadaw. Sayadaw is like the Burmese equivalent of Roshi, okay? Taunpulu, T-A-U-N-G-P-U-L-U. |
    | [00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2694) |  Taunpulu Sayadaw is in town. He's at the Burmese temple. And he says he's willing to come over |
    | [00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2703) |  and talk to your group tonight. You know, this is like that joke about Jesus shows up |
    | [00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2709) |  in the parish church. I mean, it's like, oh my God, okay? Because this guy was a reputed |
    | [00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2718) |  arhat. He was old. He had not gone horizontal for 30 years. Every night, yaza, for the last |
    | [00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2728) |  three decades. Okay. They carried him around in a palanquin kind of thing. And he came. |
    | [00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2741) |  He came to my little center in Koreatown. He didn't speak any English. He had translators. |
    | [00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2748) |  And he did not look like any human being that I ever saw. I mean, in terms of his body language |
    | [00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2758) |  or whatever. Like I say, look him up on the internet, okay? It's like death walking. |
    | [00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2766) |  It's like dead man walking, okay? It was like, imagine a human made out of rubber that you |
    | [00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2778) |  could just like pull on any part of the anatomy and it would just like stretch. There's just |
    | [00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2783) |  nothing there to resist. Okay. So yeah, this guy was probably an arhat, okay? But you know, |
    | [00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2797) |  hey, I can do one yaza. But like eternal yaza? That's a whole other deal. Okay. So anyway. |
    | [00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2821) |  So first of all, what I call enlightenment is stream entry. And that's doable by you folks. |
    | [00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2829) |  I mean, that's like, you know, that's the stated goal of my program. So, you know, you |
    | [00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2839) |  think that people have this idea, oh, I'm going to get enlightenment and then everything's |
    | [00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2844) |  going to be okay. Well, the distance between having seen no self for good and full purification |
    | [00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2857) |  of consciousness, that is a huge distance. But no matter how much you tell people that, |
    | [00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2865) |  you get these weird things that they expect senior masters to somehow be perfect, okay? |
    | [00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2873) |  Or people that are enlightened at a stream entrance level, then people get all weirded |
    | [00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2880) |  out when they're screwed up in certain ways. Even though we say, you know, hey, working |
    | [00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2888) |  this whole thing out, it takes a lifetime, okay? Enlightenment in the sense of stream |
    | [00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2895) |  entry is just the beginning. But however many times you say that, people that are enlightened |
    | [00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2902) |  at some level, when they screw up, people seem to be surprised for some reason. It's |
    | [00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2907) |  like, well, they're enlightened, how could they do this and do that? Enlightenment just |
    | [00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2911) |  means that you've seen no self for good forever. But it doesn't mean you've worked out all |
    | [00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2919) |  your bad habits by any means. That's what those three other stages are. So this notion |
    | [00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2927) |  either expressed or implied or somewhere in the subconscious that because someone has |
    | [00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2934) |  a deep practice, even a practice so deep that they have abided permanent oneness and nothingness, |
    | [00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2944) |  the notion that, oh, well, everything's perfect and they never suffer about anything and they |
    | [00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2951) |  never make mistakes, it doesn't work that way. And besides, even if you become an arhat, |
    | [00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2962) |  that's great, but that's not a Buddha. What's the difference between a Buddha and an arhat? |
    | [00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2972) |  The Buddhist tradition has asked that question, okay? The Buddha is a special kind of arhat. |
    | [00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2979) |  So what's different about the Buddha if an arhat is fully enlightened, has impeccable |
    | [00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2985) |  behavior and never suffers? So then what's the difference between that and a Buddha? |
    | [00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3002) |  The Buddhist scholastic tradition says, and I think it's a very good answer, the difference |
    | [00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3008) |  is that a Buddha is a creative arhat. A Buddha comes up with something that no one discovered |
    | [00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3016) |  before, number one. And number two, it is of sufficient power and relevance that it |
    | [00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3026) |  changes human history. So from that perspective, there's only been one Buddha so far that we |
    | [00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3035) |  know of historically, 2,500 years ago, that has had that big an impact on the world being |
    | [00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3042) |  enlightened. But I think we're due for the next one, okay? But the next one may not be |
    | [00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3048) |  a person, maybe a team of enlightened, scientifically oriented, out-of-the-box thinkers, maybe a |
    | [00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3059) |  different one, with the technology as it will exist. Okay, so, this notion of... So I can |
    | [00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3074) |  see why some teachers avoid the e-word, because people have this idea that it's like, oh, |
    | [00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3080) |  you're screwed up, then you're enlightened, and everything's perfect. The other notion |
    | [00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3086) |  that people seem to have is that enlightenment happens suddenly. It can. But in my experience, |
    | [00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3101) |  not necessarily. I see that in a lot of cases, it just sort of comes on, okay? And you're |
    | [00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3112) |  acclimatized to it, you may not really quite realize that you actually have become enlightened, |
    | [00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3118) |  because it wasn't sudden and dramatic. So, there's that point. Can it happen suddenly |
    | [00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3135) |  and dramatically? Sure. But I don't particularly aim at that. However, some teachers do. They |
    | [00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3145) |  aim at getting you to have this sudden epiphany kind of thing. And if they have a track record |
    | [00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3153) |  in producing those results, then that's a good teacher, okay? When I look at teachers, |
    | [00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3160) |  I don't look at, say, oh, this one has this map that I agree with, and this one has this |
    | [00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3166) |  other map that I don't agree with, but this person says it's similar to what I say, so, |
    | [00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3172) |  you know, they're right, or something. I don't think that way about teachers. I think about |
    | [00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3179) |  track record. Someone could have a completely different perspective than I do. But if they've |
    | [00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3189) |  got a track record in leading people to significant transformation, I'd rather have you study |
    | [00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3198) |  with that person than someone that, like, agrees with my methodology but doesn't have |
    | [00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3205) |  a track record. So, anyway, be that as it may. Another thing that notion that people |
    | [00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3221) |  seem to have is, not fairly recently, is that everyone has to go through these dark night |
    | [00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3230) |  experiences before they get enlightened. Dark night experiences are sort of emptiness and |
    | [00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3239) |  no self and it's a bad trip kind of thing. Fear and depression and hopelessness and disorientation, |
    | [00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3249) |  etc., etc. And it's horrible and you just have to white knuckle through it. That everyone |
    | [00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3259) |  has to go through these. That's not been my experience at all. Now, everyone has to go |
    | [00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3267) |  through some fear and some depression and some disorientation, but not necessarily this |
    | [00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3275) |  sort of paralytic thing that can last for months or years that some people do go through. |
    | [00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3283) |  Don't worry, you probably won't. One last thing is the notion that the map is linear. |
    | [00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3295) |  That there's this step and this step and this step and this step. Because when you act... |
    | [00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3302) |  That doesn't agree with my experience. When you actually talk to people that use that |
    | [00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3309) |  and you say, well, is it like literally that or do you revisit certain steps and does it |
    | [00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3316) |  loop around, etc., etc., they'll say, oh, well, yeah, actually you do go through these |
    | [00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3323) |  things cyclically over and over again, which does agree with my experience. But the way |
    | [00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3331) |  it's presented, it's not presented that way. It's presented like there's just this linear |
    | [00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3337) |  progression. So that's why I don't have a linear map. What do I have? I have a looping |
    | [00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3345) |  and branching algorithm. And I think that a lot of the linear maps, when you really |
    | [00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3354) |  ask what really happens, are looping and branching algorithms. So that impression, I can promise |
    | [00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3364) |  you that topologically, a series of points with links is not at all the same as a net. |
    | [00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3381) |  Those are mathematically completely different critters. A sequence with arrows that only |
    | [00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3393) |  point in one direction is not at all even remotely like a directed cyclic graph. So |
    | [00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3407) |  if it's really a looping and branching algorithm, then we shouldn't be calling it a linear map. |
    | [00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3418) |  So I set the thing up so that you do certain procedures and certain things happen. Some |
    | [00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3427) |  of the things that happen will be walls. You'll hit the wall, there'll be a challenge. And |
    | [00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3432) |  then there's something optimal to do for that challenge. Some of the things that happen |
    | [00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3438) |  will be windows. There'll be windows of opportunity. And there's something optimal to do. And the |
    | [00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3444) |  whole thing is just loops and branches and loops and branches, optimizing your experience |
    | [00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3450) |  as the months and years go on. And that's sort of the view that I like to take. |
    | [00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3457) |  Now, having said that, I don't have a map, etc., etc. I have to be honest, it is also |
    | [00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3468) |  true that there are certain broad trends. But it's not like everyone goes through these |
    | [00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3480) |  trends. There is a trend over time for the themes of flow and impermanence and so forth |
    | [00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3496) |  to become prominent in your practice. But that doesn't mean that if that's not the case, |
    | [00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3504) |  that your practice isn't working. But I openly talk about flow and so forth because I think |
    | [00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3516) |  it's useful to know about it and to work with it and so forth. So, yes, there is a tendency |
    | [00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3527) |  as time goes on for many people for that to become more and more prominent part of your |
    | [00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3535) |  meditation landscape. But as I say, that's not necessarily the case for everyone. So |
    | [00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3547) |  how will you know if you're making progress? Well, I give you four ways of judging if you're |
    | [00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3554) |  making progress. It is also practically useful to touch base with at least one competent |
    | [00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3568) |  coach at least every once in a while to talk about your practice, to dialogue, to see, |
    | [00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3575) |  okay, what's working, what may not be working, get suggestions and so forth. So I think that's |
    | [00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3585) |  all that came to my mind tonight in talking about maps. Is that okay? It's something. |
    | [00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3597) |  I think in the future when the kind of really open dialogue that I envisage takes place |
    | [01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3608) |  and when evidence, objective evidence, all of the scientific method is brought into this |
    | [01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3619) |  whole thing that I would make a conjecture that maybe in a hundred years or two hundred |
    | [01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3628) |  years there will only be one universal model. But it will probably be a very complex model |
    | [01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3639) |  because it would have to cover all the individual variations of individual human beings. But |
    | [01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3650) |  I suspect that we'll someday have a true science of enlightenment. And I can't say for sure, |
    | [01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3659) |  right, but it's what my gut tells me. We'll either survive or we won't. And if we do survive, |
    | [01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3667) |  I think the future will be very bright. It's our honor and privilege to be the early adopters. |

=== "Text"
     So, the topic was the pros and cons of Dharma maps. Maps that sort of map out, okay, here is the state. I think you were mostly thinking of stages. It's like you go through these stages and this is what happens and then this happens and this happens. So, there are all these maps. So, what's the pros and cons in general of having these maps and what's the pros and cons of this map versus that map kind of thing. I'm assuming that's... The one I like is Mahasi's. Yes. The progress of insight. And I was afraid of that because that was what I would have gone to the Wikipedia and come all prepared to make comparisons and contrasts, but then again I would have missed my body work. So, maybe I'll have time tomorrow. There's 16 of them, right? 16 stages, I think. And I have a vague recollection, but I'm not going to pontificate based on that vague recollection. I have a map in my computer. Yes. I also have to think about it. Okay, but I can probably say a few things broadly on this issue. Many years ago, the Kuroda Institute, which is an academic Buddhist study institute associated with the Zen Center of LA, had an entire seminar where they invited Buddhist scholars to present papers on stages and maps throughout the Buddhist world. And I tried to find it online. I couldn't. I think it would be really cool if anybody wants to see if that was ever published or is available someplace or other similar scholarly collections where this issue is discussed in its full breadth and depth. I would, but I've got body work with Diane. Say what? I've got body work with Diane. I think you made the right decision. The map is not the journey. So you decided to make the journey. So this is good. Now, Buddhism broadly is three vehicles. And then within that, there's a gazillion other divisions. It's 2,500 years and half the world and now the whole world. And Buddhism is just a subset of world mysticism anyway. So broadly, if we're going to talk about maps and that kind of thing, we really should frame Buddhism within the larger context of world contemplative practice. So it's a huge and very rich question that you bring up. So let me just start blabbering and we'll see what comes up. First, I'd like to share my own experience. Well, actually not. Before we do that, so three vehicles, numerous subdivisions, and that's just a subset of what's worldwide. So within Buddhism, what do we have? Well, let's see. We have the ten observing pictures. That's my most popular YouTube presentation, which tells you that people are really in the stages and what have you. And that's used in Zen. But see, here's the deal. There's different versions of the ten. There's one that has eight. So this already tells us that it's not exactly constrained to exactly ten. What else is there? Well, there's the one that I frequently use myself, which is the four classes of noble individuals, the four Aryabhugala. These are maps for a lifetime of practice. This is really big picture stuff. Sota, Apana, Sakadagami, Anagami, Araha. So that's stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, and worthy, if I were to translate these into English. Over a lifetime of practice or in traditional belief, over lifetimes of practice, you pass through these four stages. But then there's the stages of insight, which are like 16 stages that precede stream entry, I believe. So it's like, oh, it's all this fine subdivision. And then there's the four jhanas, the eight jhanas, the nine jhanas, which are not exactly paths to enlightenment, but they're definitely demarcations and are related. So the Chinese have their ox-herding pictures. The Tibetans have their elephant-herding pictures. And there are various stages. And some of those elephant-herding pictures look an awful lot like some of the versions of the ox-herding pictures. And since, once again, remember that Eastern Tibet and Western China are the same place, so we're not surprised that there would be interactions there, even though the political concerns of those two cultures don't like to, well, they definitely both have axes to grind with regards to history. And that can sort of get in the way. What else is there? Well, there are the ten bodhisattva stages. And then there are Tozan's five degrees, and I'm pretty sure there's a five-stage, one five-stage model that's prominent in the Kargyu lineage. I could be wrong about this. You get the general idea here. There's a lot. So now I'll tell you my own story. I started out not as a Buddhist practitioner, but as a Buddhist scholar. And actually, I'm very glad that I had that academic background and that training. And it was serious graduate-level training that involved mastering a half-dozen languages of Asia and reading these things in the original languages, etc., etc. So I'm glad I had that background. But in some ways, well, I remember when I was in the Zen temple in Japan when I started, one of the senior monks there said, because I could really impress them, I mean, I knew classical Chinese and Sanskrit. He said, someday all your learning will be very useful. Someday in the distant future, when you're in a position to teach, it's going to be really, really good that you know all this stuff academically. But right now, it's like totally getting in the way of your practice. And he was totally right. So what happened to me was I spent, I would say, at least 15 years, the first 15 years of my practice, torturing myself with regards to where am I at on these maps. Have I experienced this yet? And then it was actually like literally torture. It was like if I read some classic thing, it's like, oh my God, there's a stage I haven't heard of even. What to say of achieved? I never even heard of this one. Well, that's another one to put on the list of I'll never be anywhere until I experience X, Y, and Z. And I mean, it was horrible. It was like for me, because there was so much grasping around the notion of I got to get somewhere and I got to get these signs and there's all of these things to do. Well, fortunately, eventually I grew up and grew out of that. But that is one of the dangers of having these maps. Okay, we're going to talk about pros and cons. I'm certainly going to talk about pros, but there's certain cons. One of them is that you get very concerned with rating. And of course that just links into the whole thing that when did it start? The sixth grade, kindergarten, certainly by middle school, by high school, it's all about mate and rate, right? So it's status. And so it links into all of that stuff, et cetera, et cetera. The other possible con about these maps is what I was talking about, which I briefly alluded to, which is putting an inordinate amount of time and energy and emotional investment in the maps or the quest, the map quest, the quest for the right map. Time and energy that is therefore not devoted to practice. So if you go on the internet, most Buddhist time and energy on the internet is being spent in contention about who's got the right map. You don't know whether to laugh or cry because there's people that are interested in making the journey are not interested by and large in debating about who's got the right map by and large because there's only so much time and energy. And the trap is, well, I don't want to start to make the journey until I'm sure that this is the very best, right? Because I don't want to be like not doing the very best. And then what happens is that years pass and people just study and argue and study and argue and study and argue. So what I find useful, although I know to say this is offensive and confusing perhaps, but I myself take great comfort in the notion which I alluded to briefly and has already annoyed people, the notion that actually none of these maps really work very well by my standards of what I would call work very well, meaning that I know enough based on my own personal experience as a professional meditation teacher and as a pretty good dilettante scientist, I know enough to know that we can do a lot better with regards to making enlightenment available to great masses of people. By we I mean humanity and I mean in the next few centuries. It will take a combination of three things, deep practice, a scientific mentality, and out-of-the-box creativity. But there will be people, probably dozens, maybe hundreds of people in the future that bring these three things together. And it seems to me not unreasonable that they will come up with things that change the course of human history, that dramatically change the course of human history. All of the maps and methodologies that we now have essentially are based on one approach, which is introspection. An individual looks within, discovers certain things, and creates a formulation based on that. Often based in part on what they've learned from the past, usually taking some parts of that, rebelling against other parts, and often creating something new that wasn't there before. Some combination of accepting the past, rebelling against the past, and innovation. Then a new model, a new path arises, but it's still based on an individual's introspection. And it's pretty good. When I say they're all relatively ineffective, I just mean that it takes a very long time. And most people are not, most human beings are just not willing to put the time and energy like you and I are into this path. So what is lacking is an objective view of what's going on, a view based on hard science and evidence. What is also lacking is true collaborative dialogue among the masters, and among the masters and their students. The great, right now the great masters, most of them are old fashioned, old Asians, with whom which you cannot communicate in an open peer to peer kind of dialogue. They won't do it with you as a student, it's just not on their cultural radar. And they won't do it among each other either, because there's just too much at stake. So they're not like scientists. In science, there could be a Nobel laureate up there, talking about something, and I could be a graduate student. And I could get up and I could say you're wrong because of this, this, this and this. And if I'm right, if I've got evidence to back it up, then that's it. It's over. Even though I'm just a no one that no one's ever heard of, and this guy's got a Nobel Prize, he was wrong. I pointed out something. That kind of thing, that doesn't happen in the context of meditation teaching. But I think it will as things become more modern and more Western. You start to have really frank dialoguing among the masters and among the masters and their students. So the combination of turning the lens of science towards it, plus really being willing to discuss things, specifically to look at each other's maps and discuss in an open way, what's this, what's this. No, I don't quite think it works that way, etc. etc. That will probably happen in the future. Now, of course, when I say that in general they don't work well based on what I think will eventually replace them in the future, don't get me wrong. Relative to not using these maps, relative to not doing this practice, well, forget about that. The alternative to what we now have is horrific. The alternative to not doing it. So, you know, it's good that we have this. I just think we can, we meaning humanity, can potentially do a lot better. So, okay, so what should we think about, what should we, how should we think about these maps? Well, I pointed out some of the cons. Let's talk about some of the pros. They can give you an idea of where to go, what to look for. They can give you an idea of what's optimal to do when various things occur. That's really useful. They can motivate you. It's like, well, why do it if there's not goodies at the end? Or in the middle? Or even maybe in the beginning? So, you can be motivated by this and you can be informed by it so you know what to look for. So that's good. They are based, at least in part, on real people's real experience. And those are by and large real people with very, very deep experience. So, people with very, very deep experience, that's something we need to pay attention to. However, it is also important to realize that not everything that appears in those maps is necessarily a deep person's deep experience. Because other factors enter into the creation of these things. What are some other factors? Well, some master a thousand years ago might have said some things to a student. But they didn't write it down. When that student wrote it down, well, that student's ideas are there mixed with that master's ideas. Perhaps there's speculations. So you cannot be sure that you're getting the ipsit-dixit, the very words that were said. Furthermore, these things were usually written by hand, not printed. Printing is... well, Chinese had printing a long time ago, but they were written by hand, so you get scribal error. So if you start to get all fundamentalist about exactly what's there, you know, it must be exactly that way. Well, it just might be some scribal error. Also, because of the authoritarian nature of these cultures, there's a need to make your innovations appear to agree with scripture. So there can be a forcing, where it's like forced onto a certain model that has been passed down. All of these, therefore, give us our caveats, not to get fundamentalist about what's literally there. On the other hand, as I said, by and large, these are important experiences of deep masters. And so there's really something to learn. The Buddha said that there are three epistemological bases. Epistemology means the investigation of how we know, how we gain valid knowledge. So in ancient Greece it was the same, in ancient India it was the same. There's three bases. Direct experience, logical inference, and reliable authority. Now, the Buddha rejected reliable authority. He said base yourself on direct experience and on logical inference. But the fact is, maybe the fact is that consulting with an expert is a good idea. But there's a difference between consulting with an expert and reading something that was written, hopefully, by an expert a thousand years ago, but may have other things that have entered in there. Because when you consult with an authority, you can dialogue. But when you've got a text that has come down to you, you can't dialogue with the person that wrote that text. So the good news is that there's probably stuff in there that is hugely valuable. The other news is, though, that we can't, we can only, it's a very one-sided communication. It's not like when you hire a consultant and you say, you know, this person knows what they're talking about, so let's see what their opinion is and then you can ask questions, etc. So those are some of the pros and cons of having these maps. I myself don't have a map. I don't say that you'll pass through certain stages and delineate what those stages are. But I do give you some general trends. I say that over time you're going to notice an elevation in your concentration, clarity and equanimity. And that's going to have some pretty dramatic effects on your life. So I like to talk more along those lines. Yet inevitably we want to know that we're making progress in some way or another. So I will give you four criteria that you can use to judge your progress. Starting with the least, what would I say? Starting with, each of these criteria is valid, but there's a hierarchy of maturity. I'm going to end with the most mature. So that means I'm going to begin with the least mature, but you don't have to take that as a put-down. The least mature criteria is, during periods of practice I have experiences that are unusual, interesting, fun, entertaining, and so forth. An awful lot of people, for an awful lot of people that is the criteria. If you want to sell spirituality, you sell entertainment. But I'm not saying that that's completely without validity. Because if fun and interesting and unusual things happen, then that's going to motivate you to keep practicing. So from that perspective, that's fine. The only problem is, I don't care who you are or who your teacher is or what you're doing, it ain't going to always be fun and interesting and entertaining and have unusual things happen. So then when it's the opposite of all those, if you hold out these criteria of fun, interesting, unusual, entertaining, then when the opposite of those happen for a period of time, which could be perhaps a long period of time, then it's to hell with meditation. You don't want to do it anymore. So, that's one criteria, because have fun if you can. A little bit more mature is during a formal period of practice, you can actually taste mindfulness. You can taste concentration, clarity, and equanimity right while you're doing the practice. And each one of them has its own taste, its distinctive reward taste. And it's a mature palate. You learn how to taste that. There's just a taste of being concentrated. And as Mike Chixentli Hai pointed out, that's an intrinsic reward just to being concentrated. Doesn't matter what you're concentrated on, independent of the particular focus. Hence, you could be doing a god awful boring task, like licking stamps or the archetypal nun task is stepping out communion wafers, okay? You know, like hours and hours every day just making these communion wafers. Okay, now, I would suggest to you that that is either heaven or hell, depending on how recollected you are. Recollected is the Catholic word for Samadhi. So, if you're tasting, like Shelley, some of you know Shelley Young. So, before she became a really impressive psychotherapist back when we were kids, she used to do temp jobs. And it was literally like licking envelopes, right? Putting stamps on it, whatever. So, she'd go to these temp jobs and there would be other temp workers doing this. And as the day progressed, you could see their moods deteriorate, okay? They were just like, by the end of the day, they were just like, you know, not doing a very good thing. But she would just get higher and higher and higher, right? Because it was Samud, it was Karma Yoga, it was a tasted concentration, Samadhi, the rest of it, the taste of Samadhi was there all day. So, I mean, she left and she was just like, you know, she's doing this shit job, pardon my French. But the more shit job it is, the actually easier it is to meditate, in that sense, right? The simpler. So, you know, with that taste of concentration. So, and the clarity has its own taste and the equanimity is the taste of release and catharsis of purification. So, yes, if you can actually taste those things while you're doing formal practice, then, yeah, that's good, that's a sign of progress. But what about when you can't taste those things? Because that's going to happen. Why? You can go for years with very deep states of mindfulness, but then either something happens in the external world that's pretty challenging or nothing's happening in the external world, but it's just time for the next layer of stored material to release. And suddenly it seems as though you're back to square one. You can't focus, it's just like everything is surface, it's like I never meditated before. Now, you're not really back to square one, the clock is not pointing to where you started, okay? Many days have passed, okay? It's not the same day, even though it seems like the clock is still pointing to, you know, twelve o'clock or what have you. But it seems that way. So, you're not going to have those reward flavors. So, then what? Well, if that's all that you use to judge your practice with, then you're not going to be meditating. So, what's the next mature, more mature criterion is not now linked to what I experienced during formal practice. It's linked to the long-term effects of the practice in daily life. It's possible you might not have anything unusual or entertaining during the practice. It's possible that you might not even taste concentration, clarity or equanimity individually or collectively. But you notice there's a trend in daily life as you're sort of popping around in the world with regards to five things. One or a combination of the following five. Less suffering, more fulfillment, insights, understandings about things that sort of happen, either personal or transpersonal, improvements in your behavior and a kind of sense of love and service for humanity, a disappearing of that fundamental alienation that separates inside and outside. And along with that, a sense of a larger identity that it is your privilege to serve. If in one or a combination of these, it can just be one, often it's reduced suffering. It's not necessarily the whole list. But if in any of these areas you're noticing improvements and it seems to be linked to the practice, then we say that you're making progress and the practice is working. The most mature criteria is to just do the practice and not really, you just do the practice, you do the practice and you're not really thinking that much about the goals. As Maezumi once said, when asked directly, what is satori? What is enlightenment? He said, satori to satori de nai to no kubetsu ga naku naru koto deshou. I think you could say that satori, enlightenment, is the passing away of the distinction between enlightenment and non-enlightenment, which is a very empowering statement in a lot of different ways. So you might say that how far away are you from enlightenment would be measured in exactly how much you identify with the moment by moment arising of the conviction, I'm not enlightened and I won't be. So the length of time between where you're at now and enlightenment is no longer than the length of that thought, I'm not enlightened, depending on your relationship to that thought each time it comes up. So, very fast path to enlightenment, have a complete experience of the belief that you're not enlightened. Now you understand a complete experience, I described a complete experience. Complete experience is a paradoxical experience. It's infinitely full and absolutely vacuous at the same time. Okay, so, here's a, let's see, I wrote down, I did actually write down a couple of things. Okay. What does that say? Okay. It's in Chinese. Okay, so here are some common beliefs about the maps that people have and that don't agree with my experience. I just say it that way. One very common belief is that there's this thing called enlightenment and before it happens to you, you're messed up and after it happens to you, everything is perfect. Now, you know, when we say it that way, we sort of like laugh and well, no one's that naive, but actually this notion is deep down in people, okay, because I see it. It's like, even though we say that like, even if we use the Theravada model, okay, and we say enlightenment is stream entry, what is, well, there's like three more steps, right? And although it may seem from pututjana to ariya, to a street, to a sotapanna. Pututjana means you're not there yet, okay, means, literally means an ordinary person, okay, pututjana. So from pututjana to sotapanna seems very far, I know, but sotapanna to araha, that distance, that's really far, okay. Stream enters all over the place, all over the place. Arahas, I mean, I've met a few that probably were or could have been if they wanted to be, Sasaki Roshi could be if he wanted to be, I'm not sure he wants to be an araha. Well, you say, well, wait, that doesn't make any sense. But when you're that enlightened, the difference between enlightenment and non-enlightenment goes away, okay. So we can't really fathom the decisions of people like that. You look at the classical path and you see the descriptions of what arahas are supposed to be like, well, Sasaki Roshi's not that way, okay, but you sense he could be that way if he wanted to. He just doesn't want to sever the connection to humanity. That's called the bodhisattva. I mean, the ones that I've met from Southeast Asia, like Thamphu Luseda, you can find him on the internet, okay. You can actually get videos of the Thamphu Luseda. He was a reputed araha. 20, 30 years ago, how long ago, I don't remember. Remember, some of you can remember when I was downtown at CMC in Koreatown, at my own center there. Yeah, Charlie, Judy, go back that far. You remember? Yeah, you do remember. I remember picking you guys up at the station downtown. I remember learning to meditate with that ice cream truck, too. Oh, yeah. The ice cream truck and the schizophrenic derelicts and the mariachi on one side and the Sino-Vietnamese opera on the other side. To say nothing of the gunshots and the turf wars of the drug dealers fighting on the front lawn. We're killing you, Araha! And we're actually there meditating. Yeah, that was, that's the center I used to have. It was like amazing. New Year's? Ah! New Year's in El Barrio. It's the Battle of the Bulge. Guns everywhere. I mean, automatic weapons. So, you know this thing of sitting, sitting until midnight? It's so tame now. You know, it's really like very anti-climactic for me. Like, last night, was it last night? The night before, whatever. You know, hit the bell here, I heard maybe a firework somewhere. You don't even hear people go, ah! You know, because we're just too far away from things. But when we were down at the community meditation center downtown, we did the thing. I've been doing the sit, you know, the chant, the om mani padme, and then we ring the bell exactly at midnight. I've been doing that for like 40 years or something. Well, down there, it would start like maybe a minute before you know the bell was going to ring because, okay, because the gunshots would start. And then it would just reach this crescendo. It would end on all sides. And you could actually see the tracer bullets going out, okay, out the window. I think it's illegal now, right? To shoot off guns. I thought it was illegal then. And so then you hit the bell, right? And then there would just be this firestorm of rounds going off in all directions. But anyway, back in those days, which had their charm, but I'm sure glad we grew out of that. But back in those days, when I give classes, there would be four or five people. It was a pretty small operation. So one of my residents, just before, I used to do this thing on Monday where people would come. So one of my residents calls me up and he says, Taunpulu Sayadaw. Sayadaw is like the Burmese equivalent of Roshi, okay? Taunpulu, T-A-U-N-G-P-U-L-U. Taunpulu Sayadaw is in town. He's at the Burmese temple. And he says he's willing to come over and talk to your group tonight. You know, this is like that joke about Jesus shows up in the parish church. I mean, it's like, oh my God, okay? Because this guy was a reputed arhat. He was old. He had not gone horizontal for 30 years. Every night, yaza, for the last three decades. Okay. They carried him around in a palanquin kind of thing. And he came. He came to my little center in Koreatown. He didn't speak any English. He had translators. And he did not look like any human being that I ever saw. I mean, in terms of his body language or whatever. Like I say, look him up on the internet, okay? It's like death walking. It's like dead man walking, okay? It was like, imagine a human made out of rubber that you could just like pull on any part of the anatomy and it would just like stretch. There's just nothing there to resist. Okay. So yeah, this guy was probably an arhat, okay? But you know, hey, I can do one yaza. But like eternal yaza? That's a whole other deal. Okay. So anyway. So first of all, what I call enlightenment is stream entry. And that's doable by you folks. I mean, that's like, you know, that's the stated goal of my program. So, you know, you think that people have this idea, oh, I'm going to get enlightenment and then everything's going to be okay. Well, the distance between having seen no self for good and full purification of consciousness, that is a huge distance. But no matter how much you tell people that, you get these weird things that they expect senior masters to somehow be perfect, okay? Or people that are enlightened at a stream entrance level, then people get all weirded out when they're screwed up in certain ways. Even though we say, you know, hey, working this whole thing out, it takes a lifetime, okay? Enlightenment in the sense of stream entry is just the beginning. But however many times you say that, people that are enlightened at some level, when they screw up, people seem to be surprised for some reason. It's like, well, they're enlightened, how could they do this and do that? Enlightenment just means that you've seen no self for good forever. But it doesn't mean you've worked out all your bad habits by any means. That's what those three other stages are. So this notion either expressed or implied or somewhere in the subconscious that because someone has a deep practice, even a practice so deep that they have abided permanent oneness and nothingness, the notion that, oh, well, everything's perfect and they never suffer about anything and they never make mistakes, it doesn't work that way. And besides, even if you become an arhat, that's great, but that's not a Buddha. What's the difference between a Buddha and an arhat? The Buddhist tradition has asked that question, okay? The Buddha is a special kind of arhat. So what's different about the Buddha if an arhat is fully enlightened, has impeccable behavior and never suffers? So then what's the difference between that and a Buddha? The Buddhist scholastic tradition says, and I think it's a very good answer, the difference is that a Buddha is a creative arhat. A Buddha comes up with something that no one discovered before, number one. And number two, it is of sufficient power and relevance that it changes human history. So from that perspective, there's only been one Buddha so far that we know of historically, 2,500 years ago, that has had that big an impact on the world being enlightened. But I think we're due for the next one, okay? But the next one may not be a person, maybe a team of enlightened, scientifically oriented, out-of-the-box thinkers, maybe a different one, with the technology as it will exist. Okay, so, this notion of... So I can see why some teachers avoid the e-word, because people have this idea that it's like, oh, you're screwed up, then you're enlightened, and everything's perfect. The other notion that people seem to have is that enlightenment happens suddenly. It can. But in my experience, not necessarily. I see that in a lot of cases, it just sort of comes on, okay? And you're acclimatized to it, you may not really quite realize that you actually have become enlightened, because it wasn't sudden and dramatic. So, there's that point. Can it happen suddenly and dramatically? Sure. But I don't particularly aim at that. However, some teachers do. They aim at getting you to have this sudden epiphany kind of thing. And if they have a track record in producing those results, then that's a good teacher, okay? When I look at teachers, I don't look at, say, oh, this one has this map that I agree with, and this one has this other map that I don't agree with, but this person says it's similar to what I say, so, you know, they're right, or something. I don't think that way about teachers. I think about track record. Someone could have a completely different perspective than I do. But if they've got a track record in leading people to significant transformation, I'd rather have you study with that person than someone that, like, agrees with my methodology but doesn't have a track record. So, anyway, be that as it may. Another thing that notion that people seem to have is, not fairly recently, is that everyone has to go through these dark night experiences before they get enlightened. Dark night experiences are sort of emptiness and no self and it's a bad trip kind of thing. Fear and depression and hopelessness and disorientation, etc., etc. And it's horrible and you just have to white knuckle through it. That everyone has to go through these. That's not been my experience at all. Now, everyone has to go through some fear and some depression and some disorientation, but not necessarily this sort of paralytic thing that can last for months or years that some people do go through. Don't worry, you probably won't. One last thing is the notion that the map is linear. That there's this step and this step and this step and this step. Because when you act... That doesn't agree with my experience. When you actually talk to people that use that and you say, well, is it like literally that or do you revisit certain steps and does it loop around, etc., etc., they'll say, oh, well, yeah, actually you do go through these things cyclically over and over again, which does agree with my experience. But the way it's presented, it's not presented that way. It's presented like there's just this linear progression. So that's why I don't have a linear map. What do I have? I have a looping and branching algorithm. And I think that a lot of the linear maps, when you really ask what really happens, are looping and branching algorithms. So that impression, I can promise you that topologically, a series of points with links is not at all the same as a net. Those are mathematically completely different critters. A sequence with arrows that only point in one direction is not at all even remotely like a directed cyclic graph. So if it's really a looping and branching algorithm, then we shouldn't be calling it a linear map. So I set the thing up so that you do certain procedures and certain things happen. Some of the things that happen will be walls. You'll hit the wall, there'll be a challenge. And then there's something optimal to do for that challenge. Some of the things that happen will be windows. There'll be windows of opportunity. And there's something optimal to do. And the whole thing is just loops and branches and loops and branches, optimizing your experience as the months and years go on. And that's sort of the view that I like to take. Now, having said that, I don't have a map, etc., etc. I have to be honest, it is also true that there are certain broad trends. But it's not like everyone goes through these trends. There is a trend over time for the themes of flow and impermanence and so forth to become prominent in your practice. But that doesn't mean that if that's not the case, that your practice isn't working. But I openly talk about flow and so forth because I think it's useful to know about it and to work with it and so forth. So, yes, there is a tendency as time goes on for many people for that to become more and more prominent part of your meditation landscape. But as I say, that's not necessarily the case for everyone. So how will you know if you're making progress? Well, I give you four ways of judging if you're making progress. It is also practically useful to touch base with at least one competent coach at least every once in a while to talk about your practice, to dialogue, to see, okay, what's working, what may not be working, get suggestions and so forth. So I think that's all that came to my mind tonight in talking about maps. Is that okay? It's something. I think in the future when the kind of really open dialogue that I envisage takes place and when evidence, objective evidence, all of the scientific method is brought into this whole thing that I would make a conjecture that maybe in a hundred years or two hundred years there will only be one universal model. But it will probably be a very complex model because it would have to cover all the individual variations of individual human beings. But I suspect that we'll someday have a true science of enlightenment. And I can't say for sure, right, but it's what my gut tells me. We'll either survive or we won't. And if we do survive, I think the future will be very bright. It's our honor and privilege to be the early adopters.
