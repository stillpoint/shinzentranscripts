    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=0) |  Shenzhen, thank you so much for giving your time and energy today and always selflessly. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=17) |  Well, I appreciate being appreciated. |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=20) |  You had a teacher once, you were saying that the way to show, you say this at the end of retreats, |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=27) |  you say the way to show gratitude, what do you usually say? |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=32) |  The best way to show gratitude to you for all you've done. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=37) |  I would say a couple of things. |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=42) |  One is keep up your practice. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=46) |  The other is pass it on, as they say. |
    | [00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=54) |  In some way or another, either at the subtle level of your vibe and your behavior changes, |
    | [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=61) |  or at the descriptive level of you can describe your own practice to people, |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=67) |  and even though you're not teaching them in any explicit way, they hear what you do |
    | [00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=73) |  and you can give a clear description of what you yourself do, |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=76) |  and that's a kind of very important way you can teach people. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=80) |  Or maybe at the fully explicit level, you pass it on by becoming a teacher yourself |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=87) |  and actually teaching techniques. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=91) |  So I would say continue your practice, pass it on. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=95) |  And then the other thing I would say, what I would want from people is that they forget about me. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=108) |  I would want them to forget about me as a person. |
    | [00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=112) |  In other words, I know that sounds shocking and confusing, |
    | [00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=116) |  what I mean is to not link this to a person, an individual teacher. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=125) |  There's only one teacher, one thousand-armed goddess of compassion |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=130) |  that spans all time and all space, |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=133) |  and every individual teacher is just one hand on that, or one face on that, on her. |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=143) |  And we tend to just, I don't know, we look at the limbs, we don't see the whole goddess. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=153) |  So I would want them to forget about me as a person |
    | [00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=156) |  and realize that I'm just one part of this giant activity |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=163) |  that has been propagating since prehistoric times. |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=169) |  So not link it to a particular personality, what you got. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=174) |  Just forget about me completely. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=179) |  Well, I'm going to express my gratitude. |
    | [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=183) |  I'm going to go out and tell somebody about this and then I'm going to forget all about you. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=188) |  I'm happy. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=189) |  Not! |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=190) |  Well, that's on you. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=192) |  Thanks again. |
