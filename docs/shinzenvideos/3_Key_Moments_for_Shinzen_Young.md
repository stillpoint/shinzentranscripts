    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=0) |  So in your probably early experiences with meditation, can you recall any key moments |
    | [00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=16) |  when you realized experientially that, whoa, this is shifting the nature of my experience |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=25) |  in a way I hadn't expected? |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=29) |  Probably the first key moment came a few months into the practice when I started to notice |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=37) |  that at the end of an hour set, the voice that had always been screaming in my head, |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=47) |  although it was still present, it was like at a distance. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=52) |  It wasn't screaming anymore. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=55) |  I didn't have to listen to it instantly. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=60) |  I never experienced anything like that. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=63) |  It was like the internal talk, by the end of a set, the internal talk hadn't gone away, |
    | [00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=68) |  but it was like at a distance. |
    | [00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=70) |  It was muffled. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=72) |  That was a whole new world for me. |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=77) |  So I went to my teacher and I said, my sitting's getting interesting. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=82) |  He said, oh, in what way? and I described this phenomenon. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=85) |  He said, oh, that's good. |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=87) |  You're starting to go into Samadhi, into a state of high concentration. |
    | [00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=93) |  So then he said, now you have anything that you experience on the cushion, you must eventually |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=103) |  be able to experience in daily life. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=106) |  I thought, this is crazy. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=108) |  I could barely get a little hint of that quieting of internal talk. |
    | [00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=117) |  After an hour of focusing on my breath, how can I possibly maintain this in daily life? |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=123) |  He said, well, you can't. |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=125) |  Just do it. |
    | [00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=127) |  That was a pivotal experience. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=129) |  That was really new and something that who would have ever thought that was possible |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=135) |  for someone like me to experience even a few moments of quiet, of internal self-talk. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=144) |  I would say the second dramatic thing that ever happened to me came at the end of my |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=151) |  first week-long Zen retreat in Japan, which was this horrific killer ordeal. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=161) |  It was in the summer, the very first night they broke three sticks over people. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=170) |  The mosquitoes were an inch long, they could bite you through your clothes. |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=177) |  It was like, Japan is very moist, so in summer you're just sweating. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=184) |  You're not allowed to move at all, no matter what. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=187) |  By the way, this is a good example of what I mean by horrific ordeals that I would like |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=192) |  people not to have to go through by working smart with precise vocabulary. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=202) |  Because if we talk about this, people say, hey, who would ever put themselves through |
    | [00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=206) |  that? |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=207) |  They don't see themselves in that scenario. |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=210) |  You don't have to do this kind of thing. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=213) |  The first time I did do that kind of thing, by the end I nearly had lost my marbles. |
    | [00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=219) |  I was starting to have insane ideation, literally insane thoughts, like a torture victim, basically. |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=229) |  My whole body was shaking with pain. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=234) |  I thought I was going to cry. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=236) |  I was sure I was just going to start bawling. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=241) |  It was the last sit of the last day. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=246) |  I was just holding on. |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=248) |  My whole body was shaking. |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=250) |  I was just holding on for dear life. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=254) |  I realized I was about to cry. |
    | [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=257) |  Not just cry, I mean bawl, like break down. |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=262) |  I started to scream in my talk space, you're not a baby, don't cry. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=267) |  You're not a baby, don't cry. |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=269) |  Over and over again. |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=273) |  Suddenly, for no reason, I dropped into equanimity, big time. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=284) |  It wasn't just the quiet that I described before. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=289) |  My entire being dropped into a spontaneous equanimity. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=294) |  The way you know that's happened is the pain level is exactly the same, but the suffering |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=300) |  level dramatically reduces, or perhaps even goes away. |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=307) |  In this particular instance, the suffering completely went away. |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=313) |  I went from near fainting level of pain to my body totally relaxed. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=320) |  Yes, the internal talk turned off. |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=325) |  The pain turned into a kind of flowing energy that was just massaging my being. |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=331) |  It was like I could have stayed there forever. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=333) |  The physical body was literally breaking up into a flow of spirit. |
    | [00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=343) |  Then the bell rang that ended that sit. |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=347) |  I was never the same because you can hear somebody say this, but if you haven't experienced |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=353) |  it why should you believe it? |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=355) |  I would have never believed that that could be the case. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=359) |  That was extremely dramatic. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=361) |  A few years later, one day at the end of a day, I sat down. |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=366) |  I hadn't meditated that day. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=368) |  I was doing self-inquiry at that time, asking who am I. |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=373) |  At the end of the day, I sat down and I said, who am I? |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=377) |  I looked at my boundaries and they vanished. |
    | [00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=383) |  They never came back. |
    | [00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=387) |  I was never the same, ever. |
    | [00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=389) |  I didn't sit, I just got up. |
    | [00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=392) |  I got up. |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=393) |  I just started to walk around and communicate with the walls. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=398) |  They were like, me. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=401) |  So was the whole world. |
    | [00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=405) |  When I went to bed that night, I thought, well that's going to go away. |
    | [00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=409) |  I woke up the next morning, it was there. |
    | [00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=416) |  It never went away, ever. |
    | [00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=418) |  My whole life. |
    | [00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=419) |  I've been privileged to live. |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=421) |  How long ago was that? |
    | [00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=423) |  That was after I'd meditated for about four years. |
    | [00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=428) |  So it's been four years now, so that was like 35, 36 years ago. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=435) |  It has nothing to do with how concentrated you are. |
    | [00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=440) |  That was obviously a huge watershed. |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=445) |  That's what gives me the confidence to teach. |

     So in your probably early experiences with meditation, can you recall any key moments when you realized experientially that, whoa, this is shifting the nature of my experience in a way I hadn't expected?

You're starting to go into Samadhi, into a state of high concentration. So then he said, now you have anything that you experience on the cushion, you must eventually be able to experience in daily life. I thought, this is crazy. I could barely get a little hint of that quieting of internal talk. After an hour of focusing on my breath, how can I possibly maintain this in daily life? He said, well, you can't. Just do it. That was a pivotal experience. That was really new and something that who would have ever thought that was possible for someone like me to experience even a few moments of quiet, of internal self-talk.
