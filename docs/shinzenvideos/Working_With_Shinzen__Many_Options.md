    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=0) |  My name is Stephanie Nash and I am sitting here interviewing Shinzen Yung, who is an |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=12) |  innovative meditation teacher who's come up with his own mathematical and scientific journey |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=22) |  to zero. And we're going to be talking about a lot of things today, but before we do, I |
    | [00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=31) |  want to make sure everyone knows how to get more of you, how to access video talks of |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=39) |  yours on the website. You have MP3s, you do retreats in person, and you also do phone |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=47) |  based retreats. So let's just go through these and make sure we know which is which. First |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=53) |  for your personal retreats, if someone wants to come and do a residential retreat with |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=58) |  you, they would go to shinzen.org. That's correct. That's also a site with more than |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=66) |  a book's worth of free article content. So that's sort of my personal site and archives |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=74) |  of previous work that I've done. So you go to shinzen.org and look under my schedule |
    | [00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=81) |  if you want to come to an on-site program with me, or if you want to get like tons of |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=89) |  articles. And you can also order CDs. Yes. You have a whole CD store there. But more |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=98) |  modernly, I have an MP3 site. You are more modern now, aren't you? People would probably |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=106) |  go there, although some people like the CDs. The MP3 site is shinzentalks.com, so you can |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=114) |  download quite a bit there. The really convenient and really cool site is basicmindfulness.org. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=123) |  That's one-stop shopping for practice. Cool site. What's cool about it is all of the things |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=132) |  that tend to get in the way of people doing this practice, which means it's hard to get |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=141) |  instruction from somebody that you can relate to because they may not live in your area. |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=148) |  You can't travel. You can't leave your family. You don't want to incur expenses. You don't |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=155) |  want it to take a lot of time. There's a lot of speed bumps that get in the way of having |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=160) |  a regular practice. Basicmindfulness.org is my attempt to get rid of those speed bumps |
    | [00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=169) |  for the world. It's one-stop shopping for practice, meaning that we run classes and |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=180) |  very, very short micro-retreats that are telephone-based. Now, when I try to describe this to people, |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=187) |  I always get this glazed-over, sort of quizzical look because they can't quite compute, wait, |
    | [00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=195) |  it's in my home, it's a telephone, how does this all work kind of thing. All I can say |
    | [00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=201) |  is just try it. You will see it's very intuitive. You get cheap long-distance calling. If you |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=210) |  don't know how to do that, we've got something on the site that tells you how to get it dirt |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=215) |  cheap. You get hands-free operation either with a headset or just a speakerphone. You're |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=221) |  not on the telephone all the time, but you are on for interaction with me and for group |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=229) |  discussion and for group guided. Then you hang up, you work on your own, and then you |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=234) |  come back and you have more discussion. So all the features that would be present in |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=239) |  a residential retreat that might extend for a week, we've economically packed into a four-hour |
    | [00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=248) |  micro-retreat situation. One thing I can say from having done this, actually, when we're |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=255) |  on the phone, sometimes there's a greater intimacy. Sometimes on a phone when we talk |
    | [00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=261) |  to people versus in person where you're dealing with that energy. Having your voice coming |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=267) |  in on the phone, also when I'm in my home, it brings the association of the work into |
    | [00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=278) |  my home, but it also feels quite personalized as opposed to being in a room with a lot of |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=285) |  people. It's kind of like... |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=287) |  There's many paradoxes. People thought, oh, it's going to destroy the sense of group energy. |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=295) |  Well, it doesn't destroy it. It creates a different group energy, but there's still |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=300) |  a group energy and I can't explain it, but there is. So you got that. People said, oh, |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=306) |  well, it's in my home and in my home is where all my buttons are that I'm going to be distracted |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=313) |  and self-indulgent. I got to go away to a center. Well, what we discovered is counterintuitively, |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=321) |  if you do it, you can do it in your home and when you do it, sacramentalizes the home rather |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=327) |  than polluting the retreat. Doing it in your home sacramentalizes your home and then you |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=333) |  see that you can do it in your home. So there were many very nice counterintuitive results |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=339) |  from this. |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=340) |  So basically the second weekend of every month is home retreat practice weekend. We give |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=346) |  five independent programs, at least one of which every month is an intro program requiring |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=353) |  no previous experience in anything like this whatsoever. Meaning at any given month, anybody |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=360) |  anywhere in the world can get started with the practice and be off and running with a |
    | [00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=366) |  technique and then next month they can come back, maybe do that same technique or learn |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=372) |  another technique and it's all there. You just have to go to basicmindfulness.org, read |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=379) |  how to get started. |
    | [00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=380) |  Is there written material? |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=382) |  There's written material that has, like shinzen.org is this vast archive of stuff, but the audios |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=391) |  and the readings at basicmindfulness.org is paired down. That's just what you need in |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkn6HqGCtyM&t=397) |  order to get started with the practice. |
