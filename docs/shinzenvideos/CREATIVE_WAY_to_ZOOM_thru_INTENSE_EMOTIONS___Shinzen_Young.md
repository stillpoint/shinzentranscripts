    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=0) |  Now you know how in a, like in a ghost movie, you see that like the ghost can walk through |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=21) |  the wall, right? |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=22) |  Right. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=23) |  The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=29) |  Now imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=35) |  both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing |
    | [00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=42) |  each other when they occupied the same place at the same time. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=49) |  So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavor |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=55) |  sad, and they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=62) |  of them can occupy the same place. |
    | [00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=67) |  So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=74) |  each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=80) |  Does this metaphor make sense? |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=83) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=84) |  Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=88) |  Not in this, not this round. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=90) |  This may be the part of the missing piece because you could get them individually to |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=96) |  flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow because if they both flow at the same |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=102) |  time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering, then they won't multiply |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=111) |  together into overwhelm. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=115) |  So the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the |
    | [00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=122) |  flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=129) |  that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=140) |  body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=146) |  Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=150) |  It's an interesting, it's an interesting intimacy between them. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=157) |  Yeah. |
    | [00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=158) |  It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=163) |  And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=170) |  purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. |
    | [00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=194) |  Right. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=241) |  How's that coming? |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=243) |  Good. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=245) |  Good. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=247) |  Good in what sense? |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=249) |  When I can allow them both to share the same space and not... |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=258) |  and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=263) |  and keeping that line between them |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=265) |  and when I allow them to just kind of do that... |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=269) |  The kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=273) |  it's a very intense version of that |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=276) |  and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of PT-like energy up the body |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=281) |  and it gets very hot. |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=283) |  So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. |
    | [00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=289) |  Yes, I am. |
    | [00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=291) |  This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive, |
    | [00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=295) |  but your facial expression proves it. |
    | [00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=298) |  Yes. |
    | [00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=299) |  Okay, good. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=300) |  It's really interesting though because as it does, |
    | [00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=302) |  I find myself wanting to comment on it and I'll go off and talk |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=306) |  and then it loses it a little bit. |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=310) |  Yes, and you have to come back. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=312) |  It's got to be done purely in the body. |
    | [00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=314) |  Yes. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=315) |  Because the comments and then... |
    | [00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=318) |  It does trigger some little topics to go, |
    | [00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=321) |  but this is all about it. |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=322) |  That's right, but your use of practice allows you to stop that |
    | [00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=325) |  and not sort of go down in that. |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=328) |  Yes, plus there's motivation to kind of stay with this. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=332) |  It's intrinsically rewarding. |
    | [00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=334) |  Now, next step, see if you can have the fear and the sadness |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=340) |  dancing with and through each other with your eyes open. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=345) |  And you may find defocusing the eyes initially helpful. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=353) |  So we can maintain it somewhat into a more ordinary experience. |
    | [00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=359) |  Okay. |
    | [00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=368) |  It's interesting when I am, as I kind of go in and out here as I do it, |
    | [00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=373) |  and I'm going to talk while keeping my eyes open, |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=375) |  but I'm getting to where I'm honing in on the one specific place in the body |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=382) |  they both share in a powerful way. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=385) |  And if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, |
    | [00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=388) |  letting it be, whether it's the red or blue, you know, |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=393) |  it kind of helps me maintain it with my eyes open more. |
    | [00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=397) |  Good. |
