    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=0) |  In early Buddhism, there's a big emphasis on the notion of what's called Udayabhaya |
    | [00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=20) |  in practice. So, aya means to go, ut is up, and vi is away. So, udaya is arising, something |
    | [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=38) |  udaya, rises up, and then vyaya is passing. So, you've probably heard of arising and passing |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=51) |  as a stage that people go through in their practice where the perception is dominated |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=65) |  by a sense of coming and going. So, when you begin your practice, you're just all over |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=77) |  the map. Remember that? Sometimes it's still like that for me too. You're just all over |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=86) |  the map. We'll talk a little bit more about all over the map a little later. But you're |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=96) |  all over the map and you can't concentrate and you long for the ability to concentrate |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=103) |  and some sort of tranquility and ease. And then you actually start to experience more |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=113) |  tranquility and ease and your focus improves. And then things get sort of interesting because |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=123) |  now you have like a little secret thing that you can do anytime you want. You can taste |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=129) |  samadhi, samadhi rasa, the taste of being in a concentrated state becomes available |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=138) |  to you not only during formal practice, but also as you're sort of bopping around in the |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=148) |  world. So, that's really nice. And I can remember when that started to come on for me. And it's |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=155) |  like, wow, I got this secret thing that I can do now anytime in the day. So, it's like |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=163) |  I'll never waste any time again. Either what I'm doing is intrinsically meaningful for |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=171) |  me or I'm forced to do something that's meaningless like wait in line or be uncomfortable like |
    | [00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=181) |  I'm sick or something. And those times that would have been like really crappy at best |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=191) |  but now may be uncomfortable. Now these are my secret times because I can use them to |
    | [00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=198) |  cultivate and deepen this taste of concentration. So, that's a nice stage and really starts |
    | [00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=207) |  to change the way that you think about things. Like Don Juan in the Carlos Castaneda book |
    | [00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=214) |  said, most people think of the day in terms of fortune and misfortune, but a person who |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=222) |  is on a path to being able to see, S-E-E, thinks of the day in terms of a sequence of |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=229) |  challenges. So, I can remember this really nice stage when the day became just a sequence |
    | [00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=238) |  of okay, can I do this and still taste a little bit of concentration? Can I do this more complex, |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=244) |  complicated thing and still taste a little bit of concentration? So, that's nice. Then |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=252) |  you're able to use that concentration if you're doing a sort of deconstructive, classic mindfulness |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=259) |  approach to things. You're able to untangle the strands of self. Now in early Buddhism, |
    | [00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=269) |  the self is analysed into components in a number of different ways, but the five aggregates, |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=277) |  you can look it up on Wikipedia if you want, the five skandhas, are sort of the classic |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=283) |  deconstruction of the somethingness of selfhood. The idea is, okay, if you can untangle and |
    | [00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=292) |  unblock these, then you will see that there is no thing inside you called a self. So, |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=303) |  in my case, I have applied Occam's razor, which says, well, do things as simply as you |
    | [00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=310) |  can. What I've found is that you just need three elements to get a core sense of I am-ness, |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=320) |  mental image, mental talk, and body emotion as a system. Sure enough, if you are able |
    | [00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=328) |  to untangle those, you start to get some liberation from the sense of self as a separate, suffering, |
    | [00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=339) |  limited entity. So, that's nice. You bring sensory clarity now to the picture and you're |
    | [00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=347) |  sort of untangling. That's quite liberating, but then at an even deeper level, things simplify |
    | [00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=358) |  further. You get a sense that everything is just arising and passing, arising and passing. |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=371) |  That's true for your inner sense of self, but it's also true even for the sight, sounds, |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=378) |  and physical touches that would constitute the perception of an external world. In fact, |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=385) |  the distinction between inside and outside breaks down when you're in a situation of |
    | [00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=393) |  arising and passing. So, everything gets really, really simplified. There's just this constant |
    | [00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=400) |  rhythm of things rising up, things passing away, rising up, passing away. As that is |
    | [00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=415) |  happening, you get a sense that each of these arising and passing moments is accompanied |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=431) |  by a taste of purification. This is really hard to put into words. So, as it's arising, |
    | [00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=444) |  it's sort of like vibrating and arising. You get the sense that the somethingness of that |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=457) |  experience is sort of dissipating. In fact, sometimes I get... Now, this is just a mental |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=464) |  image, right? It's just what I'm about to describe is just a representation that happens |
    | [00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=472) |  in my image space. You might not have this same representation, but just to share, I |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=479) |  get this sense that each inner or outer, see, hear, feel, big or small, whatever it is, |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=486) |  it's sort of like this bubble that rises up and then passes away, arising, passing. It's |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=492) |  vibrating as it's arising, and it's vibrating as it's passing. I get in image space this |
    | [00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=498) |  image of like this black smoke is coming out of it and sort of like dissipating in all |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=507) |  directions. That black smoke is the somethingness of that sensory event. The somethingness of |
    | [00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=519) |  it is being released and freeing up the pure doingness of it. It actually is becoming transparent, |
    | [00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=532) |  like you can see through it. The color of the modalities, visual, auditory, somatic, |
    | [00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=541) |  or the color of pleasant versus unpleasant, or mind versus body, any sort of quality that |
    | [00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=554) |  would, quote, color that experience is like being dissipated as this sort of... The black |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=564) |  smoke would sort of represent the opacity or the thingness of that experience, and it's |
    | [00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=572) |  like dissipating. Now, once again, this is just an image, a representation in my image |
    | [00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=578) |  space of a taste of something. What it's the taste of is that sensory experience is becoming |
    | [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=588) |  transparent. It's losing its somethingness. Actually, there's what they call the three |
    | [00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=605) |  vimokshas. This is a technical term. You can look it up. It's sort of interesting. It's |
    | [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=613) |  not a commonly used set of categories in Buddhism, but it is traditional. They're called vimoksha |
    | [00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=622) |  dvara, the three gates of liberation that you go through to get free from the somethingness |
    | [00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=632) |  of self and world, the coagulation of self and world into a suffering thing. There are |
    | [00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=644) |  these three vimoksha dvaras, or gates of liberation. That's why temples in Japan, Buddhist temples, |
    | [00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=657) |  they're called vimokshas. The first thing you encounter when you approach is like a |
    | [00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=664) |  three gate situation, and it's supposed to remind you of these three gates of liberation. |
    | [00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=670) |  Anyway, one of the gates of liberation is emptiness, shunyata. Another one is animitta, |
    | [00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=683) |  which means without somethingness or without, no, a better translation, without essence, |
    | [00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=691) |  essenceless. Now, essenceless sounds sort of bad, but it means without any limiting |
    | [00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=700) |  quality. Then the last one is very interesting, apranidhana, which means effortlessness. Everything |
    | [00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=713) |  in the world is vacuous, essenceless, and just occurs spontaneously. Now, I know those |
    | [00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=728) |  words don't sound very appealing, but actually it's just bliss city when you start to have |
    | [00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=737) |  these experiences. So I can actually sort of get the sense that the essence or the thingness |
    | [00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=751) |  is dissipating, and the experience is almost like it's becoming transparent. Self and world |
    | [00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=761) |  are becoming transparent. And sure enough, also there is a kind of delicious spontaneity |
    | [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=774) |  or effortless, will-less, just happeningness in the arisings and passings. So that's the |
    | [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=783) |  three gates of liberation that you pass through the vimoksha dvara to realize nirvana. So |
    | [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=797) |  all of this that I'm describing is a consequence of clarity and equanimity. So everything simplifies |
    | [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=810) |  to this theme of arising and passing, arising and passing. And even if you're going through |
    | [00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=816) |  something excruciating in the body, even if you're going through something confusing in |
    | [00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=821) |  the mind, the flavor of excruciation or the flavor of confusion are sort of like being |
    | [00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=830) |  dissipated and they're being replaced by this one flavor, this ekarasa, which is the taste |
    | [00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=839) |  of freedom. So this is sort of the classic description of A&P, some Western teachers |
    | [00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=854) |  call it A&P, like my friend Kenneth Folk, arising and passing. It's an important stage. |
    | [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=862) |  Now the way I like to approach things is that if you do enough practice, this experience |
    | [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=878) |  that I'm describing becomes available anytime you want. It's not like something that's rare, |
    | [00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=887) |  happens occasionally, or it's like a special thing that happens on a retreat. You want |
    | [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=893) |  to move in the direction that any time during the day you can just go into what I just described. |
    | [00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=905) |  And for some people that comes on more quickly in their practice, for some people it takes |
    | [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=911) |  a little bit longer. But we're in this for the long haul. You know, my stock phrase, |
    | [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=919) |  I'm not going to promise you something that is necessarily a quick fix, but I do promise |
    | [00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=930) |  you a deep fix. But we're engaged in a householder's practice here, we're not locked in a cave |
    | [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=940) |  in Tibet or in the forest of Southeast Asia or doing like samurai bootcamp training in |
    | [00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=949) |  Japan in a Zen temple. We're bopping around living North American lives. And so we sort |
    | [00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=956) |  of have to amortize our ego death over long periods of time. You could think of it as |
    | [00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=963) |  a kinder, gentler form of ego death, as opposed to say Zen, where, oh my God, some of you |
    | [00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=973) |  know, basically they just pull the rug out from under you. It's impossible to get comfortable |
    | [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=980) |  and it's simply impossible. The day is just a sequence of physical, mental, and conceptual |
    | [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=991) |  assaults on your being. Kurushimi no renzoku is one way I've heard it described, an endless |
    | [00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1005) |  sequence of miseries. Some of you speak Japanese. Kurushimi no renzoku. At the beginning, that's |
    | [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1014) |  what it is. So what are you going to do? Well, you either leave or you're driven into the |
    | [00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1029) |  only place of relief, which is this arising, passing thing. And yes, that can happen fairly |
    | [00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1039) |  quickly under those severe monastic training situations. But we're not in that. We've made |
    | [00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1045) |  a different choice. We want the kinder, gentler version. So, okay, fine. I'm not saying that |
    | [00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1052) |  what I just described to you will necessarily happen in the first year, even the first five |
    | [00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1057) |  years of your practice, but time will happen. Time will pass. And you might be saying, yeah, |
    | [00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1065) |  but I'm old, so I don't have a lot of time. Well, you know what I'm going to say with |
    | [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1069) |  respect to that? The aging process can be an ally to liberation. It's sort of a natural |
    | [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1084) |  pointing towards no self. So one way or another, we've got time. |

=== "Text"
     In early Buddhism, there's a big emphasis on the notion of what's called Udayabhaya in practice. So, aya means to go, ut is up, and vi is away. So, udaya is arising, something udaya, rises up, and then vyaya is passing. So, you've probably heard of arising and passing as a stage that people go through in their practice where the perception is dominated by a sense of coming and going. So, when you begin your practice, you're just all over the map. Remember that? Sometimes it's still like that for me too. You're just all over the map. We'll talk a little bit more about all over the map a little later. But you're all over the map and you can't concentrate and you long for the ability to concentrate and some sort of tranquility and ease. And then you actually start to experience more tranquility and ease and your focus improves. And then things get sort of interesting because now you have like a little secret thing that you can do anytime you want. You can taste samadhi, samadhi rasa, the taste of being in a concentrated state becomes available to you not only during formal practice, but also as you're sort of bopping around in the world. So, that's really nice. And I can remember when that started to come on for me. And it's like, wow, I got this secret thing that I can do now anytime in the day. So, it's like I'll never waste any time again. Either what I'm doing is intrinsically meaningful for me or I'm forced to do something that's meaningless like wait in line or be uncomfortable like I'm sick or something. And those times that would have been like really crappy at best but now may be uncomfortable. Now these are my secret times because I can use them to cultivate and deepen this taste of concentration. So, that's a nice stage and really starts to change the way that you think about things. Like Don Juan in the Carlos Castaneda book said, most people think of the day in terms of fortune and misfortune, but a person who is on a path to being able to see, S-E-E, thinks of the day in terms of a sequence of challenges. So, I can remember this really nice stage when the day became just a sequence of okay, can I do this and still taste a little bit of concentration? Can I do this more complex, complicated thing and still taste a little bit of concentration? So, that's nice. Then you're able to use that concentration if you're doing a sort of deconstructive, classic mindfulness approach to things. You're able to untangle the strands of self. Now in early Buddhism, the self is analysed into components in a number of different ways, but the five aggregates, you can look it up on Wikipedia if you want, the five skandhas, are sort of the classic deconstruction of the somethingness of selfhood. The idea is, okay, if you can untangle and unblock these, then you will see that there is no thing inside you called a self. So, in my case, I have applied Occam's razor, which says, well, do things as simply as you can. What I've found is that you just need three elements to get a core sense of I am-ness, mental image, mental talk, and body emotion as a system. Sure enough, if you are able to untangle those, you start to get some liberation from the sense of self as a separate, suffering, limited entity. So, that's nice. You bring sensory clarity now to the picture and you're sort of untangling. That's quite liberating, but then at an even deeper level, things simplify further. You get a sense that everything is just arising and passing, arising and passing. That's true for your inner sense of self, but it's also true even for the sight, sounds, and physical touches that would constitute the perception of an external world. In fact, the distinction between inside and outside breaks down when you're in a situation of arising and passing. So, everything gets really, really simplified. There's just this constant rhythm of things rising up, things passing away, rising up, passing away. As that is happening, you get a sense that each of these arising and passing moments is accompanied by a taste of purification. This is really hard to put into words. So, as it's arising, it's sort of like vibrating and arising. You get the sense that the somethingness of that experience is sort of dissipating. In fact, sometimes I get... Now, this is just a mental image, right? It's just what I'm about to describe is just a representation that happens in my image space. You might not have this same representation, but just to share, I get this sense that each inner or outer, see, hear, feel, big or small, whatever it is, it's sort of like this bubble that rises up and then passes away, arising, passing. It's vibrating as it's arising, and it's vibrating as it's passing. I get in image space this image of like this black smoke is coming out of it and sort of like dissipating in all directions. That black smoke is the somethingness of that sensory event. The somethingness of it is being released and freeing up the pure doingness of it. It actually is becoming transparent, like you can see through it. The color of the modalities, visual, auditory, somatic, or the color of pleasant versus unpleasant, or mind versus body, any sort of quality that would, quote, color that experience is like being dissipated as this sort of... The black smoke would sort of represent the opacity or the thingness of that experience, and it's like dissipating. Now, once again, this is just an image, a representation in my image space of a taste of something. What it's the taste of is that sensory experience is becoming transparent. It's losing its somethingness. Actually, there's what they call the three vimokshas. This is a technical term. You can look it up. It's sort of interesting. It's not a commonly used set of categories in Buddhism, but it is traditional. They're called vimoksha dvara, the three gates of liberation that you go through to get free from the somethingness of self and world, the coagulation of self and world into a suffering thing. There are these three vimoksha dvaras, or gates of liberation. That's why temples in Japan, Buddhist temples, they're called vimokshas. The first thing you encounter when you approach is like a three gate situation, and it's supposed to remind you of these three gates of liberation. Anyway, one of the gates of liberation is emptiness, shunyata. Another one is animitta, which means without somethingness or without, no, a better translation, without essence, essenceless. Now, essenceless sounds sort of bad, but it means without any limiting quality. Then the last one is very interesting, apranidhana, which means effortlessness. Everything in the world is vacuous, essenceless, and just occurs spontaneously. Now, I know those words don't sound very appealing, but actually it's just bliss city when you start to have these experiences. So I can actually sort of get the sense that the essence or the thingness is dissipating, and the experience is almost like it's becoming transparent. Self and world are becoming transparent. And sure enough, also there is a kind of delicious spontaneity or effortless, will-less, just happeningness in the arisings and passings. So that's the three gates of liberation that you pass through the vimoksha dvara to realize nirvana. So all of this that I'm describing is a consequence of clarity and equanimity. So everything simplifies to this theme of arising and passing, arising and passing. And even if you're going through something excruciating in the body, even if you're going through something confusing in the mind, the flavor of excruciation or the flavor of confusion are sort of like being dissipated and they're being replaced by this one flavor, this ekarasa, which is the taste of freedom. So this is sort of the classic description of A&P, some Western teachers call it A&P, like my friend Kenneth Folk, arising and passing. It's an important stage. Now the way I like to approach things is that if you do enough practice, this experience that I'm describing becomes available anytime you want. It's not like something that's rare, happens occasionally, or it's like a special thing that happens on a retreat. You want to move in the direction that any time during the day you can just go into what I just described. And for some people that comes on more quickly in their practice, for some people it takes a little bit longer. But we're in this for the long haul. You know, my stock phrase, I'm not going to promise you something that is necessarily a quick fix, but I do promise you a deep fix. But we're engaged in a householder's practice here, we're not locked in a cave in Tibet or in the forest of Southeast Asia or doing like samurai bootcamp training in Japan in a Zen temple. We're bopping around living North American lives. And so we sort of have to amortize our ego death over long periods of time. You could think of it as a kinder, gentler form of ego death, as opposed to say Zen, where, oh my God, some of you know, basically they just pull the rug out from under you. It's impossible to get comfortable and it's simply impossible. The day is just a sequence of physical, mental, and conceptual assaults on your being. Kurushimi no renzoku is one way I've heard it described, an endless sequence of miseries. Some of you speak Japanese. Kurushimi no renzoku. At the beginning, that's what it is. So what are you going to do? Well, you either leave or you're driven into the only place of relief, which is this arising, passing thing. And yes, that can happen fairly quickly under those severe monastic training situations. But we're not in that. We've made a different choice. We want the kinder, gentler version. So, okay, fine. I'm not saying that what I just described to you will necessarily happen in the first year, even the first five years of your practice, but time will happen. Time will pass. And you might be saying, yeah, but I'm old, so I don't have a lot of time. Well, you know what I'm going to say with respect to that? The aging process can be an ally to liberation. It's sort of a natural pointing towards no self. So one way or another, we've got time.
