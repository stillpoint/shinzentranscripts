    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=12) |  And that's the primordial perfection of the source acting. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=19) |  And that is the world that we lived in, in infancy. |
    | [00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=26) |  I have vague recollections of that time. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=30) |  It's taken years of practice to remember what it was like. |
    | [00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=37) |  I remember three watersheds. |
    | [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=44) |  I have a vague recollection of when I was just expanding, contracting effortless space |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=51) |  instead of having objectified experience of self and world. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=57) |  I can remember that. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=58) |  I can remember discovering the power of crying. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=66) |  If I cried, I would get this attention. |
    | [00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=72) |  That was a really major epiphany. |
    | [00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=78) |  And then I remember this horrible, horrible thing happening. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=84) |  It just sort of came on. |
    | [00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=86) |  It came out of nowhere. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=89) |  And it just came on like gangbusters. |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=98) |  I started to worry about things. |
    | [00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=103) |  I started to have thoughts and fears. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=111) |  I don't know how old, but I'm imagining two, three, four, something like that. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=120) |  It was like, what is this? |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=123) |  This wasn't here before. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=126) |  Suddenly I was worried and afraid and thinking about stuff. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=133) |  That was the arising of the inner system as a self. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=139) |  I can remember it coming on. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=142) |  It's like, what is this? |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=144) |  What's happening to me? |
    | [00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=148) |  It's like, why am I scared and thinking? |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=151) |  Of course, I didn't have those words for it, but in retrospect. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=155) |  I can remember those watersheds. |
    | [00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=157) |  We can go back as adults with our adult competency and have the best of both worlds. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=166) |  We can experience, because our first world is never really lost, our very first world. |
    | [00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=175) |  We're now here, now always, always a condition of complete simplicity. |
