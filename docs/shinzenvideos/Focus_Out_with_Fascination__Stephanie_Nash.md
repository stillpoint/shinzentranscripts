    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=0) |  So, two times ago, I focused on flow. |
    | [00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=22) |  So what I had everybody do was tune into the moving, changing nature of everything with |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=29) |  acceptance. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=30) |  And it can be the moving, changing nature of anything visual, which could be we watch |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=35) |  leaves moving and just tuned into the movement as opposed to that's a leaf, that's a branch. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=41) |  And there might be different frequencies of movement. |
    | [00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=43) |  The branch might move like this while the leaves move like this. |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=46) |  We just tune into that movement. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=48) |  Let the movement be a visual massage. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=50) |  I talked about how doing this driving around LA can be wonderful. |
    | [00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=55) |  There's traffic, people, right? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=57) |  There's movement happening. |
    | [00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=58) |  And you can just allow that. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=60) |  And it doesn't keep you, you don't start driving into walls. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=63) |  You're still present. |
    | [00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=65) |  But it can create a kind of an acceptance and a massage in the visual field. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=69) |  You can do it with sounds. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=71) |  Sounds are just moving and coming and going and expanding and contracting. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=76) |  You know, there can be just different movement of sounds. |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=80) |  And that's seeing and hearing out in the outside world. |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=83) |  Seeing hearing in, you can apply that movement of sound and they come and go to the talk |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=89) |  in your head. |
    | [00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=90) |  Oh, it's a sound coming and going and getting louder and softer. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=94) |  It's just movement. |
    | [00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=95) |  You can do it closing your eyes with images. |
    | [00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=97) |  When we see, we tend to, I have a blank place where we rest visually. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=102) |  You just close your eyes and it might be just patches of lightness and darkness. |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=105) |  And for a lot of people, it's like a lava lamp. |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=108) |  It's got a glob here and it comes and goes. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=111) |  You can just watch that movement of it and let that be a visual massage. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=114) |  Or if images come in, for most people it's not like, hi, there's a square picture frame. |
    | [00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=119) |  It's usually a vague, hazy, subtle thing or maybe part of an image comes and goes out |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=124) |  or something reminds you of something. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=126) |  And just let that movement of images coming in and out be a visual massage. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=131) |  And in the body, you can work with sensations moving around. |
    | [00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=135) |  Breath is an ultimate movement to come in and go out. |
    | [00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=139) |  There's how many different kinds of breath meditation I personally have taught, I don't |
    | [00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=143) |  know, 10, 12 different ways of looking at the breath. |
    | [00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=145) |  But one way I did was just noticing the movement, the expanding, the contracting, maybe the |
    | [00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=150) |  movement of air coming through the nose, maybe emotions coming in and out. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=155) |  A sound happens and ooh, you know, birds happen and I feel a little movement of delight in |
    | [00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=160) |  my body or a dog barks and I feel, oh, maybe a little tension and release there or something. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=166) |  So that we just turn into the movement nature and everybody thought, oh, that's cool, that's |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=171) |  fun. |
    | [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=172) |  And it makes us softer and I feel like I've really meditated, you know. |
    | [00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=176) |  Then the next week I went, okay, now we're going to look at stillness. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=179) |  We're going to look at space and rest. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=182) |  I tuned everyone into the same visual thing when you close your eyes. |
    | [00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=189) |  Kind of focusing on movement, even though movement's there, you're not watching movement. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=193) |  It's a place to park. |
    | [00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=196) |  We even worked with just a sense of space around you, a space around things to allow |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=202) |  things to happen inside a bigger space. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=205) |  The real thing that was an eye opener for a lot of people was auditory, listening to |
    | [00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=210) |  silence even though sound is present. |
    | [00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=213) |  So we open out to the world of sound and there might be sound there, sound there, but what |
    | [00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=218) |  if we listen in a direction there is no sound? |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=220) |  Ah, tuning into that space and then maybe even listening to the silence beyond sound. |
    | [00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=227) |  Ah, huge space, very expansive focus and everybody felt like, oh, we've really meditated now. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=233) |  You know, that's different. |
    | [00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=234) |  That's different than how we get through life. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=236) |  So we had one week of flow and then one week of rest and space. |
    | [00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=241) |  So today I thought, let's celebrate solidity. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=247) |  And this is also, if you've got emails, I ended up putting it as the theme. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=252) |  You've heard of the power of now, right? |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=254) |  Let's be present. |
    | [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=255) |  Well, there's a way to tune in to see and you'll notice everything I do is visual, auditory, |
    | [00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=262) |  somatic. |
    | [00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=263) |  We have five senses plus our thought process. |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=267) |  Our five senses plus our thought process are what tell us who we are, when, where, why, |
    | [00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=273) |  how we feel about it, what we want to do, what happened and whether that was good or |
    | [00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=276) |  bad and what all our judgments are and all our suffering comes in in these five senses |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=285) |  plus our thought process. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=287) |  And you could say thoughts and feelings, but the feelings will be in the body. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=293) |  And you can divide all of that into three because I like three. |
    | [00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=297) |  Trinity is also one of the things about three. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=300) |  My meditation teacher, Shinzen Young, came up with this though. |
    | [00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=303) |  It's his brilliance and his ingredients I cook with and send always appreciation and |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=309) |  gratitude to teachers, always, always, always. |
    | [00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=312) |  I come from teachers and thank you. |
    | [00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=317) |  But he divides it all into visual, auditory, somatic. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=320) |  So your entire sensory experience, your thoughts, visual, I see images, I hear internal talk. |
    | [00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=327) |  So there's visual, auditory to thoughts. |
    | [00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=330) |  Things are in the body and there might be a thought component, but that's visual. |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=333) |  So see, hear, feel. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=335) |  We either see out the world, we see into our mind. |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=338) |  We hear out the sounds, we hear in to the talk. |
    | [00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=342) |  Feel out and feel in. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=344) |  Feel in will be emotions. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=346) |  Then we're doing subjective versus objective. |
    | [00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=349) |  Subjective would be emotional sensations. |
    | [00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=351) |  I have fear in my chest. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=354) |  You know when you want to cry sometimes and you try to choke it down, the tongue kind |
    | [00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=357) |  of gets engaged here and we've even got terms like cat got my tongue and I got a lump in |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=361) |  my throat. |
    | [00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=362) |  I was all choked up. |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=363) |  You know, and it gets, or teary feeling behind the eyes or a wave of love, of warmth we might |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=369) |  feel in the chest. |
    | [00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=370) |  Or you get embarrassed, there might be a flush you feel up in your face. |
    | [00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=374) |  Usually it's the front part of the torso, maybe into the face, but some people get anger |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=378) |  down the back of their neck, right? |
    | [00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=379) |  The hair stood up on the back of my neck. |
    | [00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=381) |  We've got that phrase. |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=382) |  It broke my heart, right? |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=384) |  We have all sorts of ways in which emotions play in the body and we don't, we might say |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=390) |  my heart or I couldn't stomach that or you know, we'll point to parts of the body, but |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=395) |  it's usually kind of, it, they're vague. |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=399) |  It's kind of another dimension of feeling in the body. |
    | [00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=401) |  We can't say that was this organ. |
    | [00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=404) |  It kind of spreads and takes a certain area of the body and it's a kind of sensation just |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=410) |  like earlier today in the meditation. |
    | [00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=413) |  I had you tune into a particular flavor sensation. |
    | [00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=417) |  The flavor or flavors of letting go release. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=420) |  There are other sensations. |
    | [00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=422) |  You could still feel your butt on the cushion, but we were tuning into letting go. |
    | [00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=426) |  While in the same way, feel in are certain sensations that are emotional in nature. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=432) |  And if you're not sure, say they're not. |
    | [00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=435) |  But if you think they are, if you think, ah, every time I go, damn it, why did he do that? |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=442) |  And I feel this clench in here. |
    | [00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=443) |  We'll call that emotional in nature. |
    | [00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=445) |  Okay. |
    | [00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=446) |  And so you start to get to know where anger happens in your body, where fear, anger, fear, |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=452) |  sadness, shame. |
    | [00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=453) |  Those are the big four. |
    | [00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=456) |  People suffer and kill themselves over those all the time. |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=459) |  So and then we have good ones, love, joy, peace, gratitude, and they tend to be subtler. |
    | [00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=464) |  The louder ones tend to, hey, I'm here, but just like restful that we tuned into, that's |
    | [00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=470) |  a subtle thing that's available at any given moment. |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=473) |  But no, I'm not tuning into that. |
    | [00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=475) |  I'm tuning into that guy cut me off, you know, or the talk, right? |
    | [00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=481) |  So you can, as a choice, learn to tune into these subtle. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=484) |  It's like tuning in a fainter radio station, but after a while, it's not so subtle. |
    | [00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=489) |  The more you tune into it, the bigger it gets. |
    | [00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=492) |  You know that way. |
    | [00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=493) |  You literally develop new neural pathways in the brain. |
    | [00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=497) |  I grew up in the woods, so I talk about taking a path in the woods, and I didn't like taking |
    | [00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=502) |  the regular trail. |
    | [00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=503) |  I'd always like to take a different trail. |
    | [00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=505) |  That to me was fun. |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=506) |  I used to try to get lost. |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=507) |  I thought that was so exciting. |
    | [00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=508) |  That moment when I'm like, I don't know where I am, because I grew up in a small town where |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=512) |  everyone knew you since you were born and just anything unknown was thrilling. |
    | [00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=516) |  And I do a new path, and then pretty soon I take that new path every day, and that's |
    | [00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=520) |  my path, and all the animals would take that path, and then pretty soon the old one grows |
    | [00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=524) |  over, right? |
    | [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=526) |  And then pretty soon that's the main path. |
    | [00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=527) |  Well, now I've got to try another one. |
    | [00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=529) |  But I've talked with neurologists and brain researchers, and at Harvard, even the guys |
    | [00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=538) |  who studied my brain when I was there, and they say what I describe as those paths in |
    | [00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=544) |  the woods, I'm telling people that's a way to create new paths, and they have told me |
    | [00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=548) |  that is exactly what happens in your brain. |
    | [00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=551) |  That every time you have that thought, and this happens, oh, the brain goes, there's |
    | [00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=556) |  a pathway. |
    | [00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=557) |  So the next time that thought happens, there's a higher probability you're going to have |
    | [00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=561) |  that same response because it knows that path. |
    | [00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=564) |  Not because that was the best one, not because that's the one that feels good. |
    | [00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=569) |  And then we have a tendency to associate familiar with what we like, and those are two different |
    | [00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=576) |  things. |
    | [00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=577) |  And I learned that real big at Duke when we worked with battered housewives who would |
    | [00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=581) |  rather get hit than go to something they didn't know. |
    | [00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=583) |  And they even sometimes let their children get hit rather than go to something they didn't |
    | [00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=588) |  know because there was a life or death fear of leaving that isn't rational. |
    | [00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=595) |  It has to do with us associating familiar with good. |
    | [00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=601) |  So in that way today, I'm going to be having you, now you're going, oh, this is going to |
    | [00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=608) |  be scary. |
    | [00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=609) |  So today I'm going to have you tune into something you do all the time. |
    | [00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=612) |  See here, feel out. |
    | [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=613) |  Sight, you see all the time. |
    | [00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=614) |  Hear, you hear sounds all the time. |
    | [00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=615) |  Feel in the body, oh, I didn't do feel out in the body. |
    | [00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=621) |  Feel in where emotions, feel out is every other sensation. |
    | [00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=625) |  Every objective sensation that is not emotional. |
    | [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=628) |  But on the cushion is feel out. |
    | [00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=630) |  Feel your tongue in your mouth, that's feel out. |
    | [00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=633) |  It's objective. |
    | [00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=634) |  There's no drama. |
    | [00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=638) |  There's no emotion in it. |
    | [00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=639) |  The breath is one of the reasons we use breath in meditation. |
    | [00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=646) |  For some people, 30% of people, when you say focus on your breath, they attempt to control |
    | [00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=650) |  it. |
    | [00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=651) |  They can't not. |
    | [00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=652) |  And so it's an unpleasant experience for them. |
    | [00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=654) |  But people who teach breath meditation don't always factor that. |
    | [00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=658) |  That can be an issue. |
    | [00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=659) |  But you feel your hands. |
    | [00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=661) |  You can feel your feet on the floor, clothes on your skin, temperature, humidity of air |
    | [00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=666) |  on your skin. |
    | [00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=667) |  There's lots of touch sensations that are not emotional in nature that would be feel |
    | [00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=672) |  out. |
    | [00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=673) |  So today, to be here now, our dramas tend to be where? |
    | [00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=679) |  See and hear and feel in, right? |
    | [00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=681) |  Thoughts and feelings. |
    | [00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=682) |  Ah, I remember that. |
    | [00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=685) |  This happened and I play it over and over again. |
    | [00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=688) |  We replay our traumas. |
    | [00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=689) |  We traumatize ourself over and over again, right? |
    | [00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=694) |  Where's a safe place to go? |
    | [00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=695) |  Well, we can go to our happy flow place. |
    | [00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=697) |  We did that. |
    | [00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=698) |  We can go to our happy rest place. |
    | [00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=699) |  Everybody wants to go to a happy place. |
    | [00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=702) |  We can actually ground ourselves in the truth and the reality of allowing all of our attention |
    | [00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=710) |  to soak into, penetrate, explore what we're seeing. |
    | [00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=719) |  Now see, hear, feel. |
    | [00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=722) |  We do it all the time. |
    | [00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=723) |  But what we tend to do is see and hear in general. |
    | [00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=729) |  We tend to let it all be one thing. |
    | [00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=733) |  We don't tend to separate out see from hear from feel. |
    | [00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=738) |  It's just all this stuff happening. |
    | [00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=740) |  And we tend to be drawn to an arising, pleasant or unpleasant, a loud sound. |
    | [00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=747) |  And that the only time we separate hear from see would be like music, art, and seeing the |
    | [00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=757) |  art. |
    | [00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=758) |  We'll let the art feel it. |
    | [00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=759) |  But then we'll have an emotional sensation to the art or something else. |
    | [00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=762) |  But we're not separating necessarily, deliberately separating the see out from it. |
    | [00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=768) |  In fact, the internal talk may be going wild while we're seeing the art. |
    | [00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=772) |  What does he mean? |
    | [00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=774) |  But to just focus in on the see, just focus in on the hear, just focus in on the feel. |
    | [00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=783) |  Now when you do this, especially with see out, hear out, feel out, it doesn't mean that |
    | [00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=791) |  if I'm just focusing on the see, I have stopped feeling and I have no ability to hear or sounds |
    | [00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=797) |  have all stopped. |
    | [00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=798) |  It doesn't mean that at all. |
    | [00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=800) |  It means I am selectively attending. |
    | [00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=804) |  I have so much real estate in my consciousness and I am filling it, choosing meditation, |
    | [00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=810) |  I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the rest of my body. |
    | [00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=815) |  I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the visual experience. |
    | [00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=820) |  So it's a choice to do it and at first it may seem effortful. |
    | [00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=831) |  Well normally I just see and hear and feel. |
    | [00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=834) |  You're making me just go there and just go there and just go there. |
    | [00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=840) |  Or you might say, I have trouble concentrating. |
    | [00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=843) |  I want to develop my concentration. |
    | [00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=846) |  Well my answer to that, this is my yellow brick road, is fascination. |
    | [00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=852) |  I guided, I think the week before last week, I think I did a 45 minute meditation on flow. |
    | [00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=859) |  I think I was. |
    | [00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=860) |  And last week was probably 35. |
    | [00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=861) |  But I did a 45 minute meditation. |
    | [00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=862) |  And everyone went, I didn't think that was 45 minutes. |
    | [00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=863) |  I was like, 20 minutes. |
    | [00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=864) |  And I said, okay, because that means you were in a state of high concentration. |
    | [00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=873) |  What's that mean? |
    | [00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=874) |  It means you were there and you weren't wandering off somewhere. |
    | [00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=878) |  You were there. |
    | [00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=881) |  Why were you there? |
    | [00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=883) |  Well I happen to think it's fascinating. |
    | [00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=886) |  So I share that fascination. |
    | [00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=888) |  It's like the fascination and I always say like a four year old with a ladybug. |
    | [00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=893) |  You know, we're four that can't, in fact you cannot take a three or four year old and walk |
    | [00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=897) |  across, if this room were grass and a grass yard, you couldn't go from there to here in |
    | [00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=903) |  five minutes with a three or four year old because there'd just be too many interesting |
    | [00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=907) |  things to see. |
    | [00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=908) |  Whoa, look at that. |
    | [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=909) |  That is so cool. |
    | [00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=910) |  Look at that ladybug. |
    | [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=911) |  It just opened its wings. |
    | [00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=912) |  Oh my goodness. |
    | [00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=913) |  And I work with people in chronic and acute pain. |
    | [00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=914) |  You can look at your pain that way. |
    | [00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=915) |  You can look at your emotions. |
    | [00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=916) |  Oh my God, I have terror here. |
    | [00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=917) |  Okay, where do you feel it? |
    | [00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=918) |  Where are the boundaries? |
    | [00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=919) |  Is there movement? |
    | [00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=920) |  Is it the same in the middle or in the outside? |
    | [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=921) |  No one's ever asked anybody these questions. |
    | [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=922) |  I don't know. |
    | [00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=923) |  Well, maybe. |
    | [00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=924) |  Actually, I think it's a good question. |
    | [00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=925) |  I think it's a good question. |
    | [00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=926) |  I think it's a good question. |
    | [00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=927) |  I think it's a good question. |
    | [00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=928) |  I think it's a good question. |
    | [00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=929) |  I think it's a good question. |
    | [00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=936) |  When you start exploring it, it is friggin' fascinating. |
    | [00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=940) |  And guess what? |
    | [00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=941) |  The suffering's gone. |
    | [00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=943) |  You're watching the pain. |
    | [00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=946) |  Usually as soon as we start watching it and stuff, often it turns into an energy. |
    | [00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=950) |  It often presents its flow nature. |
    | [00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=952) |  And pretty soon the suffering's gone. |
    | [00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=954) |  But fascination, this childlike fascination to explore with curiosity, with kind of an |
    | [00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=962) |  openness, that to me isn't where we're going. |
    | [00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=967) |  That's the yellow brick road to getting there. |
    | [00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=970) |  And so people who say, I can't concentrate, that fascination creates concentration. |
    | [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=976) |  Because everybody who did that 45 minutes wasn't able to sit at home for 45 minutes |
    | [00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=980) |  without their attention wandering. |
    | [00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=982) |  They were fascinated. |
    | [00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=983) |  They were interested. |
    | [00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=985) |  It rivets your attention. |
    | [00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=986) |  When you're doing something you really like, you go at it and hours go by and you're not |
    | [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=991) |  aware of it, right? |
    | [00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=993) |  You like it. |
    | [00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=994) |  So I say, get fascinated. |
    | [00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=996) |  You can practice getting fascinated. |
    | [00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1000) |  That 45 minute meditation, some people went, oh my goodness, I had no idea there was this |
    | [00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1006) |  and they went there and then this. |
    | [00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1009) |  Or last week with the rest, the whole notion of tuning into silence, even though sound |
    | [00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1014) |  was there, was like wow to people. |
    | [00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1016) |  And then we went there and then, so we filled one 45 minute meditation with all these things |
    | [00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1022) |  to explore and another just with flow. |
    | [00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1026) |  And then another 35 minute meditation filled with just places to rest and park and space. |
    | [00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1033) |  Every single moment of all those meditations is available in every moment. |
    | [00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1041) |  Every friggin' moment of your sensory experience is friggin' fascinating. |
    | [00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1046) |  There's so much to soak into. |
    | [00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1049) |  You just got to shift to that four year old and what I'm trying to supply is saying, it's |
    | [00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1056) |  like saying, have you ever wiggled your ear or a little tone? |
    | [00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1058) |  No one ever tried it. |
    | [00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1060) |  No one ever said, have you ever done that? |
    | [00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1063) |  It wasn't until my meditation teacher said, well what if you just look at that? |
    | [00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1068) |  What if you separate this experience? |
    | [00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1069) |  It didn't occur to me to separate it. |
    | [00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1071) |  I thought my emotions were part of the experience and I thought what I thought was the truth. |
    | [00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1077) |  I thought that voice in the head was me. |
    | [00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1080) |  I thought that was my narration of my life. |
    | [00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1084) |  The idea that the voice in my head wasn't me, I was just like, whoa. |
    | [00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1089) |  It's not who's driving the car, it's what's on the radio and I can turn it down or turn |
    | [00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1096) |  it off or change the channel or if the knob is stuck I can just treat it as background |
    | [00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1101) |  sound like the water or traffic or birds. |
    | [00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1106) |  Never occurred to me. |
    | [00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1107) |  So I was lucky to get a teacher to say, hey look, here's some other ways you can tune |
    | [00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1114) |  into that. |
    | [00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1115) |  That kind of makes life better, doesn't it? |
    | [00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1118) |  All this richness. |
    | [00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1120) |  And the question I get, and this was just on the YouTube video I put up, I had to re-watch |
    | [00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1125) |  myself. |
    | [00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1126) |  But some people go, doesn't that take away the beauty? |
    | [00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1132) |  You know, you're looking at these ingredients and you're missing that whole beauty of it. |
    | [00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1141) |  Doesn't that kind of take it away? |
    | [00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1144) |  You're getting kind of technical here. |
    | [00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1147) |  No. |
    | [00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1149) |  If all those ingredients are available in every given moment, do you see the richness |
    | [00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1156) |  and depth that's there? |
    | [00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1159) |  You start to realize that what we've been looking at is a cartoon versus what's real. |
    | [00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1166) |  What's really there is so much more interesting and fulfilling than what we've been accepting |
    | [00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1172) |  as. |
    | [00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1173) |  Of course that's what I think and that's what's there. |
    | [00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1177) |  What's there is what should be there. |
    | [00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1180) |  Or what could be there. |
    | [00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1181) |  Or what I'm afraid is there. |
    | [00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1184) |  So I know one teacher always says, you know your thoughts aren't real, right? |
    | [00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1190) |  And I just kind of like that. |
    | [00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1193) |  Because we go, what are you trying to say? |
    | [00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1198) |  But today we're going to work with, so if you're tangled up in thoughts and feelings, |
    | [00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1204) |  we have a lot of ways to go. |
    | [00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1206) |  You can watch them flow. |
    | [00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1208) |  You can find a place to rest. |
    | [00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1210) |  Or, and this is kind of what some Zen practice is, you can tune in to the grounded reality |
    | [00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1218) |  of the present moment of see, hear, feel. |
    | [00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1222) |  And this, I have a lot of clients who are psychologists and psychiatrists in the psychology |
    | [00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1229) |  field. |
    | [00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1230) |  There's lots of isms and ists in there. |
    | [00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1233) |  And we've communicated back and forth a lot about using mindfulness practice and stuff |
    | [00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1242) |  with patients. |
    | [00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1243) |  And I've mentioned this in here before, but there was, the person was trying to get a |
    | [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1250) |  woman to tune into her body in a restful way. |
    | [00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1253) |  And this woman had been sexually traumatized and abused. |
    | [00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1258) |  And so just going in the body at all was just danger, danger. |
    | [00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1262) |  Will Robinson can't go in the body. |
    | [00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1265) |  She just doesn't have, she just hasn't developed the skill yet to work with, there was so much |
    | [00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1271) |  there. |
    | [00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1272) |  So we said, what if we went out to sound? |
    | [00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1277) |  So she went out and worked with sound and insight, didn't even do the body at all, and |
    | [00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1282) |  developed this equanimity with it. |
    | [00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1284) |  And then developed the mindfulness skills there that then when we could come back to |
    | [00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1288) |  the body, she'd already had those muscles, those mindfulness muscles developed of clarity |
    | [00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1293) |  and equanimity and focus. |
    | [00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1296) |  So that when she came to the body, she didn't get, you know, if stuff came up, she had skills |
    | [00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1302) |  for saying, ah, this is this, this is this. |
    | [00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1306) |  And I can, I can see and work with this skillfully to then rewire the brain so that we're not |
    | [00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1312) |  re-traumatizing every time. |
    | [00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1314) |  Does that make sense? |
    | [00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1316) |  And sound is here now. |
    | [00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1318) |  So what we hear at this moment is happening in this moment, and we don't really have a |
    | [00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1322) |  drama about it. |
    | [00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1323) |  It's not related to our personal issues. |
    | [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1326) |  So if at any moment you're going, oh my God, this is going on, or I can't keep doing this. |
    | [00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1333) |  Okay, that's coming in as internal talk. |
    | [00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1335) |  That's hearing in. |
    | [00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1338) |  Wherever your distraction is, you can use your distraction to take you more deeply into |
    | [00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1343) |  your meditation. |
    | [00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1346) |  How? |
    | [00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1350) |  So if I'm hearing in, I can slide out on the auditory axis. |
    | [00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1355) |  Hear in, slide. |
    | [00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1356) |  Every time I go, my God, you know, that person is rude. |
    | [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1363) |  Okay, hear out into sound. |
    | [00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1367) |  You can think of it as some people went, oh, it's like an antidote. |
    | [00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1369) |  And I go, yeah, but it's really, you're already hearing. |
    | [00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1373) |  You're just sliding out and anchoring in the truth of this sound rather than the one you're |
    | [00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1380) |  making up in your head. |
    | [00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1383) |  And so when we hear sounds, sometimes we get images. |
    | [00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1388) |  And there's a visual component to our thinking process that we're usually less aware of because |
    | [00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1392) |  we walk around with our eyes open. |
    | [00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1395) |  But we all get image with our eyes open. |
    | [00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1397) |  And if you haven't done this with me before, I will demonstrate it. |
    | [00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1401) |  So everyone look up here to the front of the room and see this lovely scarf and really |
    | [00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1406) |  see all of, see she needs to iron that, see the texture of the wood and the light, and |
    | [00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1411) |  really, really see it. |
    | [00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1412) |  Now look up in this direction and visualize your car, the inside of your car. |
    | [00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1417) |  Okay, can you see the inside of your car? |
    | [00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1421) |  Okay, see how your focus kind of went back to see the car and this is softer? |
    | [00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1424) |  Now come forward and really see the texture here. |
    | [00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1429) |  See that difference? |
    | [00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1430) |  We do that thousands of times a day. |
    | [00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1433) |  We're not aware of it. |
    | [00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1435) |  We're going back and seeing it. |
    | [00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1436) |  Every time you get a thought, oh, I'm going to go to the grocery store, you're going to |
    | [00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1438) |  see a grocery store. |
    | [00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1440) |  He said that you're going to see his face. |
    | [00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1442) |  You're going to go back and forth like that all day long. |
    | [00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1445) |  So today we're going to be working with that, see this. |
    | [00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1448) |  If you find yourself going back, because we're going to have eyes open at one point, if you |
    | [00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1452) |  find yourself going into things, ground in this and really go up. |
    | [00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1458) |  Look for texture. |

     So, two times ago, I focused on flow. So what I had everybody do was tune into the moving, changing nature of everything with acceptance. And it can be the moving, changing nature of anything visual, which could be we watch leaves moving and just tuned into the movement as opposed to that's a leaf, that's a branch. And there might be different frequencies of movement. The branch might move like this while the leaves move like this. We just tune into that movement. Let the movement be a visual massage. I talked about how doing this driving around LA can be wonderful. There's traffic, people, right? There's movement happening. And you can just allow that. And it doesn't keep you, you don't start driving into walls. You're still present. But it can create a kind of an acceptance and a massage in the visual field. You can do it with sounds. Sounds are just moving and coming and going and expanding and contracting. You know, there can be just different movement of sounds. And that's seeing and hearing out in the outside world. Seeing hearing in, you can apply that movement of sound and they come and go to the talk in your head. Oh, it's a sound coming and going and getting louder and softer. It's just movement. You can do it closing your eyes with images. When we see, we tend to, I have a blank place where we rest visually. You just close your eyes and it might be just patches of lightness and darkness. And for a lot of people, it's like a lava lamp. It's got a glob here and it comes and goes. You can just watch that movement of it and let that be a visual massage. Or if images come in, for most people it's not like, hi, there's a square picture frame. It's usually a vague, hazy, subtle thing or maybe part of an image comes and goes out or something reminds you of something. And just let that movement of images coming in and out be a visual massage. And in the body, you can work with sensations moving around. Breath is an ultimate movement to come in and go out. There's how many different kinds of breath meditation I personally have taught, I don't know, 10, 12 different ways of looking at the breath. But one way I did was just noticing the movement, the expanding, the contracting, maybe the movement of air coming through the nose, maybe emotions coming in and out. A sound happens and ooh, you know, birds happen and I feel a little movement of delight in my body or a dog barks and I feel, oh, maybe a little tension and release there or something. So that we just turn into the movement nature and everybody thought, oh, that's cool, that's fun. And it makes us softer and I feel like I've really meditated, you know. Then the next week I went, okay, now we're going to look at stillness. We're going to look at space and rest. I tuned everyone into the same visual thing when you close your eyes. Kind of focusing on movement, even though movement's there, you're not watching movement. It's a place to park. We even worked with just a sense of space around you, a space around things to allow things to happen inside a bigger space. The real thing that was an eye opener for a lot of people was auditory, listening to silence even though sound is present. So we open out to the world of sound and there might be sound there, sound there, but what if we listen in a direction there is no sound? Ah, tuning into that space and then maybe even listening to the silence beyond sound. Ah, huge space, very expansive focus and everybody felt like, oh, we've really meditated now. You know, that's different. That's different than how we get through life. So we had one week of flow and then one week of rest and space. So today I thought, let's celebrate solidity. And this is also, if you've got emails, I ended up putting it as the theme. You've heard of the power of now, right? Let's be present. Well, there's a way to tune in to see and you'll notice everything I do is visual, auditory, somatic. We have five senses plus our thought process. Our five senses plus our thought process are what tell us who we are, when, where, why, how we feel about it, what we want to do, what happened and whether that was good or bad and what all our judgments are and all our suffering comes in in these five senses plus our thought process. And you could say thoughts and feelings, but the feelings will be in the body. And you can divide all of that into three because I like three. Trinity is also one of the things about three. My meditation teacher, Shinzen Young, came up with this though. It's his brilliance and his ingredients I cook with and send always appreciation and gratitude to teachers, always, always, always. I come from teachers and thank you. But he divides it all into visual, auditory, somatic. So your entire sensory experience, your thoughts, visual, I see images, I hear internal talk. So there's visual, auditory to thoughts. Things are in the body and there might be a thought component, but that's visual. So see, hear, feel. We either see out the world, we see into our mind. We hear out the sounds, we hear in to the talk. Feel out and feel in. Feel in will be emotions. Then we're doing subjective versus objective. Subjective would be emotional sensations. I have fear in my chest. You know when you want to cry sometimes and you try to choke it down, the tongue kind of gets engaged here and we've even got terms like cat got my tongue and I got a lump in my throat. I was all choked up. You know, and it gets, or teary feeling behind the eyes or a wave of love, of warmth we might feel in the chest. Or you get embarrassed, there might be a flush you feel up in your face. Usually it's the front part of the torso, maybe into the face, but some people get anger down the back of their neck, right? The hair stood up on the back of my neck. We've got that phrase. It broke my heart, right? We have all sorts of ways in which emotions play in the body and we don't, we might say my heart or I couldn't stomach that or you know, we'll point to parts of the body, but it's usually kind of, it, they're vague. It's kind of another dimension of feeling in the body. We can't say that was this organ. It kind of spreads and takes a certain area of the body and it's a kind of sensation just like earlier today in the meditation. I had you tune into a particular flavor sensation. The flavor or flavors of letting go release. There are other sensations. You could still feel your butt on the cushion, but we were tuning into letting go. While in the same way, feel in are certain sensations that are emotional in nature. And if you're not sure, say they're not. But if you think they are, if you think, ah, every time I go, damn it, why did he do that? And I feel this clench in here. We'll call that emotional in nature. Okay. And so you start to get to know where anger happens in your body, where fear, anger, fear, sadness, shame. Those are the big four. People suffer and kill themselves over those all the time. So and then we have good ones, love, joy, peace, gratitude, and they tend to be subtler. The louder ones tend to, hey, I'm here, but just like restful that we tuned into, that's a subtle thing that's available at any given moment. But no, I'm not tuning into that. I'm tuning into that guy cut me off, you know, or the talk, right? So you can, as a choice, learn to tune into these subtle. It's like tuning in a fainter radio station, but after a while, it's not so subtle. The more you tune into it, the bigger it gets. You know that way. You literally develop new neural pathways in the brain. I grew up in the woods, so I talk about taking a path in the woods, and I didn't like taking the regular trail. I'd always like to take a different trail. That to me was fun. I used to try to get lost. I thought that was so exciting. That moment when I'm like, I don't know where I am, because I grew up in a small town where everyone knew you since you were born and just anything unknown was thrilling. And I do a new path, and then pretty soon I take that new path every day, and that's my path, and all the animals would take that path, and then pretty soon the old one grows over, right? And then pretty soon that's the main path. Well, now I've got to try another one. But I've talked with neurologists and brain researchers, and at Harvard, even the guys who studied my brain when I was there, and they say what I describe as those paths in the woods, I'm telling people that's a way to create new paths, and they have told me that is exactly what happens in your brain. That every time you have that thought, and this happens, oh, the brain goes, there's a pathway. So the next time that thought happens, there's a higher probability you're going to have that same response because it knows that path. Not because that was the best one, not because that's the one that feels good. And then we have a tendency to associate familiar with what we like, and those are two different things. And I learned that real big at Duke when we worked with battered housewives who would rather get hit than go to something they didn't know. And they even sometimes let their children get hit rather than go to something they didn't know because there was a life or death fear of leaving that isn't rational. It has to do with us associating familiar with good. So in that way today, I'm going to be having you, now you're going, oh, this is going to be scary. So today I'm going to have you tune into something you do all the time. See here, feel out. Sight, you see all the time. Hear, you hear sounds all the time. Feel in the body, oh, I didn't do feel out in the body. Feel in where emotions, feel out is every other sensation. Every objective sensation that is not emotional. But on the cushion is feel out. Feel your tongue in your mouth, that's feel out. It's objective. There's no drama. There's no emotion in it. The breath is one of the reasons we use breath in meditation. For some people, 30% of people, when you say focus on your breath, they attempt to control it. They can't not. And so it's an unpleasant experience for them. But people who teach breath meditation don't always factor that. That can be an issue. But you feel your hands. You can feel your feet on the floor, clothes on your skin, temperature, humidity of air on your skin. There's lots of touch sensations that are not emotional in nature that would be feel out. So today, to be here now, our dramas tend to be where? See and hear and feel in, right? Thoughts and feelings. Ah, I remember that. This happened and I play it over and over again. We replay our traumas. We traumatize ourself over and over again, right? Where's a safe place to go? Well, we can go to our happy flow place. We did that. We can go to our happy rest place. Everybody wants to go to a happy place. We can actually ground ourselves in the truth and the reality of allowing all of our attention to soak into, penetrate, explore what we're seeing. Now see, hear, feel. We do it all the time. But what we tend to do is see and hear in general. We tend to let it all be one thing. We don't tend to separate out see from hear from feel. It's just all this stuff happening. And we tend to be drawn to an arising, pleasant or unpleasant, a loud sound. And that the only time we separate hear from see would be like music, art, and seeing the art. We'll let the art feel it. But then we'll have an emotional sensation to the art or something else. But we're not separating necessarily, deliberately separating the see out from it. In fact, the internal talk may be going wild while we're seeing the art. What does he mean? But to just focus in on the see, just focus in on the hear, just focus in on the feel. Now when you do this, especially with see out, hear out, feel out, it doesn't mean that if I'm just focusing on the see, I have stopped feeling and I have no ability to hear or sounds have all stopped. It doesn't mean that at all. It means I am selectively attending. I have so much real estate in my consciousness and I am filling it, choosing meditation, I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the rest of my body. I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the visual experience. So it's a choice to do it and at first it may seem effortful. Well normally I just see and hear and feel. You're making me just go there and just go there and just go there. Or you might say, I have trouble concentrating. I want to develop my concentration. Well my answer to that, this is my yellow brick road, is fascination. I guided, I think the week before last week, I think I did a 45 minute meditation on flow. I think I was. And last week was probably 35. But I did a 45 minute meditation. And everyone went, I didn't think that was 45 minutes. I was like, 20 minutes. And I said, okay, because that means you were in a state of high concentration. What's that mean? It means you were there and you weren't wandering off somewhere. You were there. Why were you there? Well I happen to think it's fascinating. So I share that fascination. It's like the fascination and I always say like a four year old with a ladybug. You know, we're four that can't, in fact you cannot take a three or four year old and walk across, if this room were grass and a grass yard, you couldn't go from there to here in five minutes with a three or four year old because there'd just be too many interesting things to see. Whoa, look at that. That is so cool. Look at that ladybug. It just opened its wings. Oh my goodness. And I work with people in chronic and acute pain. You can look at your pain that way. You can look at your emotions. Oh my God, I have terror here. Okay, where do you feel it? Where are the boundaries? Is there movement? Is it the same in the middle or in the outside? No one's ever asked anybody these questions. I don't know. Well, maybe. Actually, I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. I think it's a good question. When you start exploring it, it is friggin' fascinating. And guess what? The suffering's gone. You're watching the pain. Usually as soon as we start watching it and stuff, often it turns into an energy. It often presents its flow nature. And pretty soon the suffering's gone. But fascination, this childlike fascination to explore with curiosity, with kind of an openness, that to me isn't where we're going. That's the yellow brick road to getting there. And so people who say, I can't concentrate, that fascination creates concentration. Because everybody who did that 45 minutes wasn't able to sit at home for 45 minutes without their attention wandering. They were fascinated. They were interested. It rivets your attention. When you're doing something you really like, you go at it and hours go by and you're not aware of it, right? You like it. So I say, get fascinated. You can practice getting fascinated. That 45 minute meditation, some people went, oh my goodness, I had no idea there was this and they went there and then this. Or last week with the rest, the whole notion of tuning into silence, even though sound was there, was like wow to people. And then we went there and then, so we filled one 45 minute meditation with all these things to explore and another just with flow. And then another 35 minute meditation filled with just places to rest and park and space. Every single moment of all those meditations is available in every moment. Every friggin' moment of your sensory experience is friggin' fascinating. There's so much to soak into. You just got to shift to that four year old and what I'm trying to supply is saying, it's like saying, have you ever wiggled your ear or a little tone? No one ever tried it. No one ever said, have you ever done that? It wasn't until my meditation teacher said, well what if you just look at that? What if you separate this experience? It didn't occur to me to separate it. I thought my emotions were part of the experience and I thought what I thought was the truth. I thought that voice in the head was me. I thought that was my narration of my life. The idea that the voice in my head wasn't me, I was just like, whoa. It's not who's driving the car, it's what's on the radio and I can turn it down or turn it off or change the channel or if the knob is stuck I can just treat it as background sound like the water or traffic or birds. Never occurred to me. So I was lucky to get a teacher to say, hey look, here's some other ways you can tune into that. That kind of makes life better, doesn't it? All this richness. And the question I get, and this was just on the YouTube video I put up, I had to re-watch myself. But some people go, doesn't that take away the beauty? You know, you're looking at these ingredients and you're missing that whole beauty of it. Doesn't that kind of take it away? You're getting kind of technical here. No. If all those ingredients are available in every given moment, do you see the richness and depth that's there? You start to realize that what we've been looking at is a cartoon versus what's real. What's really there is so much more interesting and fulfilling than what we've been accepting as. Of course that's what I think and that's what's there. What's there is what should be there. Or what could be there. Or what I'm afraid is there. So I know one teacher always says, you know your thoughts aren't real, right? And I just kind of like that. Because we go, what are you trying to say? But today we're going to work with, so if you're tangled up in thoughts and feelings, we have a lot of ways to go. You can watch them flow. You can find a place to rest. Or, and this is kind of what some Zen practice is, you can tune in to the grounded reality of the present moment of see, hear, feel. And this, I have a lot of clients who are psychologists and psychiatrists in the psychology field. There's lots of isms and ists in there. And we've communicated back and forth a lot about using mindfulness practice and stuff with patients. And I've mentioned this in here before, but there was, the person was trying to get a woman to tune into her body in a restful way. And this woman had been sexually traumatized and abused. And so just going in the body at all was just danger, danger. Will Robinson can't go in the body. She just doesn't have, she just hasn't developed the skill yet to work with, there was so much there. So we said, what if we went out to sound? So she went out and worked with sound and insight, didn't even do the body at all, and developed this equanimity with it. And then developed the mindfulness skills there that then when we could come back to the body, she'd already had those muscles, those mindfulness muscles developed of clarity and equanimity and focus. So that when she came to the body, she didn't get, you know, if stuff came up, she had skills for saying, ah, this is this, this is this. And I can, I can see and work with this skillfully to then rewire the brain so that we're not re-traumatizing every time. Does that make sense? And sound is here now. So what we hear at this moment is happening in this moment, and we don't really have a drama about it. It's not related to our personal issues. So if at any moment you're going, oh my God, this is going on, or I can't keep doing this. Okay, that's coming in as internal talk. That's hearing in. Wherever your distraction is, you can use your distraction to take you more deeply into your meditation. How? So if I'm hearing in, I can slide out on the auditory axis. Hear in, slide. Every time I go, my God, you know, that person is rude. Okay, hear out into sound. You can think of it as some people went, oh, it's like an antidote. And I go, yeah, but it's really, you're already hearing. You're just sliding out and anchoring in the truth of this sound rather than the one you're making up in your head. And so when we hear sounds, sometimes we get images. And there's a visual component to our thinking process that we're usually less aware of because we walk around with our eyes open. But we all get image with our eyes open. And if you haven't done this with me before, I will demonstrate it. So everyone look up here to the front of the room and see this lovely scarf and really see all of, see she needs to iron that, see the texture of the wood and the light, and really, really see it. Now look up in this direction and visualize your car, the inside of your car. Okay, can you see the inside of your car? Okay, see how your focus kind of went back to see the car and this is softer? Now come forward and really see the texture here. See that difference? We do that thousands of times a day. We're not aware of it. We're going back and seeing it. Every time you get a thought, oh, I'm going to go to the grocery store, you're going to see a grocery store. He said that you're going to see his face. You're going to go back and forth like that all day long. So today we're going to be working with that, see this. If you find yourself going back, because we're going to have eyes open at one point, if you find yourself going into things, ground in this and really go up. Look for texture. That's the fascination. Look for texture. Every time you look, try to see something different you didn't see before. Like the kid with the ladybug or walking across the grass. That make sense? Cool. That's what we're going to do.
