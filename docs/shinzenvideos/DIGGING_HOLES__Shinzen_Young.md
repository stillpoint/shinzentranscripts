    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=0) |  We could say, you know what, my path to enlightenment is going to be see it. |
    | [00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=11) |  That's it. |
    | [00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=12) |  Theoretically, you could do that. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=15) |  Assuming you have had enough image activity to warrant that. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=21) |  And then it's all about seeing. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=24) |  It's about having a complete experience of seeing. |
    | [00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=29) |  So complete that it bores a hole through the time-space continuum. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=34) |  And the whole field just gets sucked into that nirvanic black hole through seeing alone. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=45) |  Could you do that in theory? |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=47) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=48) |  Could you do that with any of these atoms in theory? |
    | [00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=51) |  Yes. |
    | [00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=52) |  Could you do that with any of the modalities or any of the themes? |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=57) |  Yes, you could. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=60) |  Because remember appreciation, which is just my poetic way of saying experience mindfully. |
    | [00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=69) |  Appreciation and experience mindfully is experience with concentration, clarity, and equanimity. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=76) |  So quick way of saying all of that, appreciation taken to its limit beyond a certain threshold |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=83) |  of skill, appreciation becomes transcendence. |
    | [00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=89) |  It points to the formless. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=94) |  So that is to say that although we have the possibility of working at using this sort |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=101) |  of microscope with three magnification pieces, atoms, systems, everything, that is not to |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=108) |  say you have to do that. |
    | [00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=110) |  It's just to say that a person could do that. |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=114) |  Now you probably heard the expression, oh, well, you shouldn't dig a whole lot of holes. |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=121) |  You should just dig one deep hole. |
    | [00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=124) |  Well, for some people that's probably true. |
    | [00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=130) |  You should just have one thing and just stick with that, but not inevitably. |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=137) |  And I would rather use a different metaphor than the lot of shallow holes, which is pejorative. |
    | [00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=146) |  I would say you can learn a couple of ways. |
    | [00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=151) |  One way is yeah, okay, dig all the way down from the form to the formless, one hole. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=161) |  But you're still going to have to deal with all the rest of the stuff. |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=166) |  It gets dealt with by getting sucked down that hole, but there's still that process. |
    | [00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=174) |  Technique-wise you never do anything but this, but still all this stuff has to be dealt with |
    | [00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=180) |  through that technique. |
    | [00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=182) |  Nirvana means that the whole, you literally fold up the board. |
    | [00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=190) |  The game's over for a while anyway. |
    | [00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=193) |  You fold up the board and it goes into the closet. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=199) |  Oh, don't worry, it'll come out again. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=202) |  I didn't mention that. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=205) |  So instead of the pejorative of, oh, you're digging a lot of shallow holes, let's use |
    | [00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=211) |  a different metaphor. |
    | [00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=215) |  You've got a back hole and you're just clearing the whole field to a certain level, and then |
    | [00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=222) |  you clear the whole field to another level until when you finally get to the bottom, |
    | [00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=231) |  then there's nowhere in the surface that isn't now contacting the bottom. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=239) |  So just another way to think about the working. |
    | [00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=245) |  Our strategies to work. |
    | [00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=247) |  So what strategy should you use? |
    | [00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9_7B-nRlcs&t=249) |  What's fun and interesting and productive for you is which strategy to use. |
