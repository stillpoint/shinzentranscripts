    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=0) |  So, sometimes during the Metta, I like to do a chant. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=13) |  This is the chant that I do. |
    | [00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=17) |  So I wanted to explain what it means. |
    | [00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=21) |  Like I say, I'm not sure whether I do it or not. |
    | [00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=25) |  It's sort of like spur of the moment. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=27) |  But if you ever hear me do this chant, I want to make sure everybody understands that it's |
    | [00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=35) |  a spiritual, not political statement. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=40) |  This is one of the main Hebrew prayers that my rabbi used to say all the time. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=49) |  That's why I internalized it when I was a little boy. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=53) |  But I like it because it can be given a really deep interpretation. |
    | [00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=62) |  Excuse me while I let my whistle. |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=66) |  Shintzen, are you using that instead of the whiteboard? |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=71) |  It was just lighter to carry over. |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=76) |  Can people see it? |
    | [00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=77) |  If not, I guess you'll have to... |
    | [00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=80) |  This particular thing, unless you read Hebrew, may not be all that relevant. |
    | [00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=88) |  You know, if you sort of squint your eyes a little bit, it looks like Tibetan. |
    | [00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=94) |  That's not a coincidence. |
    | [00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=96) |  Can you believe that? |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=98) |  That is not a coincidence. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=101) |  Tibetan is derived from Devanagari script of India. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=106) |  Devanagari script of India is derived from the Aramaic script, which has its origin in |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=115) |  what is now called Lebanon. |
    | [00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=118) |  And so does Hebrew, and so does Greek, and therefore Latin, and therefore our alphabet |
    | [00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=125) |  also. |
    | [00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=126) |  Alphabet was only invented once. |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=129) |  It's one of the most extraordinary cases of cultural diffusion known. |
    | [00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=134) |  Some years ago, some very clever people in what is now Lebanon figured out the concept |
    | [00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=141) |  of alphabet. |
    | [00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=142) |  And it spread by diffusion all the way to Japan and Indonesia, and all the way to England. |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=155) |  Just went around the whole eastern hemisphere, basically. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=159) |  They all go back to one source. |
    | [00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=161) |  That's why alphabet from alpha, beta, gamma, delta, in Greek, aleph, bet, gimel, daled. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=170) |  Okay, ain't a coincidence. |
    | [00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=173) |  Anyway, this is Hebrew letters. |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=179) |  And it says, I hope I didn't screw it up. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=184) |  I did it from memory. |
    | [00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=188) |  Oseh shalom bimromav hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu ve'al kol Yisrael ve'imru. |
    | [00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=199) |  Amen. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=200) |  So this has this word, shin-lamet-men. |
    | [00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=209) |  This is a really, really interesting three syllables. |
    | [00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=220) |  The Arabic pronunciation is shalom. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=225) |  The Hebrew pronunciation is shalom. |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=228) |  Usually understood as peace, but it means a lot more. |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=233) |  A lot more. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=235) |  I'm not going to do it now, but in the past I've given an entire talk about how the entire |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=243) |  path can be described in terms of permutations of these three letters. |
    | [00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=252) |  Essentially it's not just peace. |
    | [00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=256) |  It's peace that comes through completeness. |
    | [00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=260) |  Shalom means complete as an adjective. |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=268) |  And so when you have a complete experience of something, okay, when you are complete |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=279) |  with it, where does that lead to? |
    | [00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=283) |  It leads to the absolute peace of zero. |
    | [00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=288) |  So the process of completing leads to this peace. |
    | [00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=294) |  And furthermore, it has a connotation of safety and well-being. |
    | [00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=300) |  It's all sort of there. |
    | [00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=306) |  The Afro-Asiatic languages, of which Hebrew is one, and so is Arabic, and so is Ancient |
    | [00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=313) |  Egyptian, they have a very different structure. |
    | [00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=319) |  There's three consonants, and then vowels and other consonants are permuted around that |
    | [00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=326) |  or positioned around that to create words and grammatical forms. |
    | [00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=335) |  So just the shilam alone, and then you could put vowels in different places. |
    | [00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=345) |  You can make shalom, you can make Islam, Muslim, and so forth. |
    | [00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=354) |  So anyway, this is a special kind of peace that comes about in my way of thinking through |
    | [00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=363) |  doing the activity of whatever it is. |
    | [00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=369) |  And sure enough, osay, this means doing, okay? |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=378) |  So may he or it who creates absolute peace, who is creating, actually this is a present |
    | [00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=394) |  participle, may the one who is creating the peace of heaven bring peace to you, ve'al |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=410) |  kol Yisrael, that's the part I wanted to talk about, and upon all of Israel's. |
    | [00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=420) |  So in my way of understanding, which is the way I choose to understand, Yisrael doesn't |
    | [00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=431) |  refer to a tribe or a nation. |
    | [00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=438) |  I like to think of it as the sangha, the community who struggles for spirituality, because actually |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=448) |  Yisrael, if you remember the story of Jacob's ladder, et cetera, Yisrael is from a root |
    | [00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=459) |  that means to struggle. |
    | [00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=461) |  So I interpret this as meaning to struggle to get to God, okay? |
    | [00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=469) |  So it has no political or ethnic connotations for me whatsoever within this statement, because |
    | [00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=476) |  I cannot imagine any kind of blessing that is limited to one nation or one ethnos. |
    | [00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=484) |  So just wanted to make that clear. |
    | [00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=486) |  Ve'al kol Yisrael, ve'imru and say, that should be over there, amen, which you know |
    | [00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=496) |  from English, amen, so be it, something like that. |
    | [00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=501) |  So if you ever hear me sing this during the Metta, you'll know what it refers to, because |
    | [00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=507) |  it has a lot of deep meaning. |
    | [00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=512) |  So just wanted to mention that. |

Can people see it? If not, I guess you'll have to... This particular thing, unless you read Hebrew, may not be all that relevant. You know, if you sort of squint your eyes a little bit, it looks like Tibetan. That's not a coincidence. Can you believe that? That is not a coincidence.
