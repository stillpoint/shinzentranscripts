    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=0) |  Sometimes when people first are introduced to your techniques, there can be a bit of |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=14) |  an overwhelm because they're not prepared for the technical nature of them. |
    | [00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=23) |  What would you say to people to help them get through that initial overwhelm so that |
    | [00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=32) |  they stick around to get the ultimate simplicity and good stuff it leads to? |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=41) |  I would say don't try to understand it, get used to it. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=50) |  There's a Japanese proverb, which literally means that. |
    | [00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=57) |  It's not a matter of learning it, it's a matter of getting accustomed to it. |
    | [00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=64) |  Someone once asked a very prominent 20th century mathematician, John von Neumann, about the |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=76) |  mathematics that he had used during a lecture, they said, Professor von Neumann, I can't |
    | [00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=83) |  understand your math. |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=85) |  He said, math is not something you understand, math is something you get used to. |
    | [00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=92) |  When I heard that, it was hugely helpful for me. |
    | [00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=102) |  You listen and you think and you practice and you read and you listen and you think |
    | [00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=108) |  and you practice and you read and you listen and you think and you practice and read over |
    | [00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=114) |  and over and over again, and with time, it sinks in. |
    | [00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=120) |  There is a reason why I formulated that copious and precise vocabulary. |
    | [00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=132) |  In the long run, it's going to hopefully allow people to work smarter. Because the old-fashioned |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=140) |  way, where you have to just sort of discover it on your own, and often it's a brute force method, |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=147) |  you just have to put yourself through such horrific ordeals that at some point you're just |
    | [00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=155) |  forced to experience certain states and forced to do certain things. Well, the average modern |
    | [00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=163) |  person is not going to intentionally put themselves through that kind of thing. So my idea was, |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=170) |  instead of the brute force methods, if we can make the formulation crystal clear, |
    | [00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=179) |  yes, up front it takes a little bit of work, because it's like we're being sent back to school. |
    | [00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=184) |  It's like, what? I have to learn vocabulary, I have to learn definitions, I have to make |
    | [00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=191) |  subtle distinctions with regards to things that seem irrelevant or that I haven't experienced. |
    | [00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=197) |  So I do understand that people have that resistance at the beginning. There's always |
    | [00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=203) |  strong points and weak points in every way of working. The weak point in the way that I work, |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=212) |  one of them, is that up front you're asked to really carefully think about the nature of sensory |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=221) |  experience, to have a classificatory system for sensory experience and also for the things that |
    | [00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=228) |  lead beyond sensory experience. It's described in a vocabulary that is something like the |
    | [00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=237) |  rigor and precision that we would find in mathematics. So it's like, wow, you're right, |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=243) |  that's a major stumbling block for people because they don't expect to have to learn |
    | [00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=250) |  to work that way. They're thinking they're coming to a retreat. Yeah, it's going to be |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=259) |  Zen poetry and a finger pointing to the hazy moon and suddenly it's like calculus. What am I doing |
    | [00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=267) |  here? However, my idea is that for that relatively small investment up front, in the end it will |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=277) |  allow them to work smarter and be able to achieve the classic goals, I don't necessarily say faster, |
    | [00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=285) |  but with less necessity for horrific intensities. Because when you hear about the sort of |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=296) |  traditional trainings that are done... And you're talking monastery... Yeah, monastic intensities, |
    | [00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=301) |  like, wow, who wants to put themselves through that kind of thing? So my idea is by giving people |
    | [00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=308) |  this very precise vocabulary and having them maybe work a little smarter, that in the end, |
    | [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=316) |  that will allow them to have comparable depth of experience, but still have their normal North |
    | [00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=322) |  American or modern, let's say, comfortable lifestyle. So yes, it's some investment up front, |
    | [00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=331) |  but I think, number one, if they realize how much it's going to help down the line, and number two, |
    | [00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=340) |  if they just take it gradually, just gradually get used to it. That's what I would say with regards |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=346) |  to that. Maybe take a break and do easing up, bearing down and easing up to balance, so that |
    | [00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=352) |  if they've been working very hard, they can ease up and do something that would be less intense. |
    | [00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=360) |  Well, I think you're asking with regards to learning the vocabulary, is that correct? |
    | [00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=365) |  Well, I was actually talking about first coming in with all the five ways and all the techniques |
    | [00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=371) |  and that potential overwhelm. I remember before the five ways, when I first went to one of your |
    | [00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=377) |  retreats, I said, you know, I was in an online with you and I said, you know, this is like playing |
    | [00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=382) |  scales. This is technical work, I'm having to pay attention and really play scales. And I stopped |
    | [00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=390) |  being a classical musician because I didn't want to practice my scales. And you said, it is like |
    | [00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=395) |  playing scales, but the music is your life. And I thought, good answer. You know, so that you're |
    | [00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=406) |  developing the skill to use in your life. Well, I would say that the reason I present people with |
    | [00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=414) |  several approaches is not that I necessarily want them to learn how to do all those approaches. |
    | [00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=424) |  I would like them to be exposed to a range of possibilities so that they can find what works |
    | [00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=430) |  for them. Some people like the flexibility of having five contrasting ways of working, |
    | [00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=436) |  but some people will just choose one of those five and decide that's all I'm going to go for. |
    | [00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=448) |  But at least they can see the range of what is available. And then, so the idea is not that you |
    | [00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=457) |  have to learn this giant system. The idea is all you have to do is find one good technique that |
    | [00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=467) |  works for you. And then if you want to just stay with that, fine. If you want to learn other things, |
    | [00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=473) |  that's fine too. So I think the combination of realizing that you only need one good technique, |
    | [00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=479) |  plus giving yourself time to get used to the vocabulary and take it slowly, plus realizing |
    | [00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=487) |  that the complexity and the scrupulous precision will in the end pay off because you'll be able |
    | [00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=499) |  to work smarter or get more bang for the buck, so to speak. I think keeping that in mind may |
    | [00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=506) |  help people a little bit with the challenges of studying meditation with a demented physics |
    | [00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr7txCTMeHA&t=514) |  professor. Somebody once called me that. A demented physics professor. I like that. You can use it. |

     Sometimes when people first are introduced to your techniques, there can be a bit of an overwhelm because they're not prepared for the technical nature of them.
