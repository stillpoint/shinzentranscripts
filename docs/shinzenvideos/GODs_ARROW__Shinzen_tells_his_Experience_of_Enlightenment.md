    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=0) |  How do you describe the book? |
    | [00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=6) |  Well, it's very hard to put into words. |
    | [00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=13) |  That's why most teachers don't talk about this stuff, right? For very good reason. |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=18) |  Because it can be described a lot better than the books tell you it can be described. |
    | [00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=24) |  But it cannot be perfectly described. |
    | [00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=30) |  I could try to amplify it, but it's going to be explaining the obscure with the even more obscure. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=39) |  That's okay. |
    | [00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=40) |  Yeah, I'll do it. |
    | [00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=41) |  But do it anyway. |
    | [00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=45) |  I'm going to do it anyway. |
    | [00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=47) |  I'm actually doing it as we're speaking. |
    | [00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=49) |  I have a line. |
    | [00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=53) |  There's a word in Latin that describes it, believe it or not. |
    | [00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=63) |  But it is so esoteric that almost no one has ever heard this word. |
    | [00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=74) |  The only reference that you will find to this word is if you look up the Ecstasy of St. Teresa, |
    | [00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=87) |  which refers to a piece of sculpture that was done in the high Renaissance, in the Baroque period, by Bernini. |
    | [00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=101) |  It's this great classic thing from the Counter-Reformation. |
    | [00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=107) |  Catholic art is very dramatic. |
    | [00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=113) |  So it's St. Teresa experiencing pervasive gone. |
    | [00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=128) |  But of course, how do you express that in a work of art that's going to emotionally grip people? |
    | [00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=137) |  Well, she's shown swooning. |
    | [00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=144) |  It was a hugely controversial work of art. |
    | [00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=149) |  People were very annoyed by it, and I'm talking about back in the 1600s, I guess, because it's very sensual. |
    | [00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=168) |  Let's just put it at that. |
    | [00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=170) |  Anyway, what's happening is she's out, and there's this angel on her chest, and he's pulling out this arrow. |
    | [00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=186) |  He's not stabbing her, he's actually removing the arrow. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=192) |  What happened before the arrow going through, that's called transverberation. |
    | [00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=202) |  It's when the source creates a wormhole from itself through time, space, self, and world, and back to itself. |
    | [00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=221) |  Right now, there's a wormhole. |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=223) |  It starts back here, goes through here, goes right through the center of your head, and out the other way. |
    | [00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=230) |  Part of me is looking through that wormhole, and it absolutely sees nothing. |
    | [00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=236) |  It's just void to void. |
    | [00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=239) |  But all around that is the color and form I need to interact. |
    | [00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=244) |  I really appreciate that. |
    | [00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=246) |  All I can say is, if that makes any sense to anyone, then I salute you. |
    | [00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=258) |  I just love that word, like God's arrow that goes through the time-space continuum. |
    | [00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=265) |  Of course, how wide is that channel? |
    | [00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=268) |  Well, if that channel attains a certain width, you will enter nirodha samapatti, infused contemplation, and you're out, out, out. |
    | [00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=279) |  Maybe three days. |
    | [00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=281) |  No movement, no perceptible breath, etc. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=287) |  To follow up, as a continuum, then, the degree to which you are the unfixated wormhole, and the degree to which there is a recognition of— |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=305) |  Is a movable feast. |
    | [00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=307) |  Yes, so that's the new paradigm, God's wormhole. |
    | [00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=320) |  It's called transverberation, if you're interested. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=324) |  It's just an odd word for meaning when God shoots an arrow through you. |
    | [00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=332) |  I also really enjoyed your saying what your day was. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=337) |  What I heard you say is that sometimes you live without source. |
    | [00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=344) |  That sent me to your book to look up the word source, and there are many recommendations in your book to read about source. |
    | [00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=355) |  How do you live without source during your day? |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=361) |  The same way I did before I started to meditate, because it's just the experience of an ordinary person that doesn't know how to meditate. |
    | [00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=372) |  The only difference is I don't care. |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=375) |  I have no preference between being in a deep state or just being agitated and bopping around, taking care of business. |
    | [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=385) |  Actually, St. Teresa explained it perfectly. |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=391) |  She said, it's a window, it's open all the time, but—well, not really. |
    | [00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=398) |  Sometimes it closes, but you don't care because you know it's going to open again. |
    | [00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=403) |  And you know that with such certainty that you don't even care. |
    | [00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=410) |  I have a question. The transverberation that you described the other day, the God's arrow kind of coming through with the shaft, did that for you— |
    | [00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=421) |  did that happen—we did a video on YouTube about key moments for you, and you talked about the first one where you reached around and realized your boundaries weren't there anymore. |
    | [00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=432) |  Did that happen just suddenly that day, or is this something that evolved over time? |
    | [00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=439) |  It took 20 years from the first breakthrough. |
    | [00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=442) |  The first breakthrough was that day? So it was 20 years after that? |
    | [00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=447) |  That I started to get the transverberation. |
    | [00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=450) |  And did it slowly develop? |
    | [00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=452) |  Yes, slowly. First just a hint, then more and more salient. |
    | [00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=458) |  Got it. Thank you. |
