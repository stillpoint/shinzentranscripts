    | [00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=0) |  So you were ordained a monk at Mount Koya in the Xiong'an tradition, right? |
    | [00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=14) |  Correct. |
    | [00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=15) |  Is that something you always wanted to do since you were a kid? |
    | [00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=18) |  No, not really. |
    | [00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=19) |  What I always wanted to do since I was a kid was be a samurai. |
    | [00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=27) |  I saw in the 50s Japanese samurai movies when I was in middle school. |
    | [00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=34) |  And I just got fascinated with the whole Japanese culture thing. |
    | [00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=39) |  And that led to my learning the Japanese language in LA, going to Japanese ethnic school in |
    | [00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=46) |  addition to American public school. |
    | [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=50) |  And that got me to Japan in my senior year at UCLA where I was an Asian language major. |
    | [00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=60) |  And I encountered real-life Buddhist monks, but my interest in them was just because it |
    | [00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=66) |  was the closest thing to ancient Japan that still exists. |
    | [00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=71) |  In other words, in the temples, I mean they have telephones and electricity and all that, |
    | [00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=76) |  but it's sort of like the old days, right? |
    | [00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=79) |  So I was fascinated with it. |
    | [00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=82) |  That would be the closest that I could get. |
    | [00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=84) |  Did they have swords? |
    | [00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=85) |  No, only the wisdom sword. |
    | [00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=91) |  So I was hanging out in Buddhist temples just to sort of live as close as I could the fantasy |
    | [00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=98) |  of ancient Japan. |
    | [00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=100) |  But I wasn't meditating because that's the last thing in the world I had a proclivity |
    | [00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=105) |  to do. |
    | [00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=106) |  I was scattered and impatient and wimpy and all those things. |
    | [00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=111) |  So I was just hanging out, having fun in the temple. |
    | [00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=115) |  But I had a sense that they knew a kind of secret that they would be willing to share, |
    | [00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=121) |  but they would never push on me. |
    | [00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=123) |  So when I got back to the United States, I was graduating from UCLA and I thought, well, |
    | [00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=129) |  I want to go to graduate school. |
    | [00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=131) |  I want it to be related to Asia. |
    | [00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=133) |  I'll study Buddhism because you need a lot of esoteric languages for that, and I was |
    | [00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=138) |  good at languages and so forth. |
    | [00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=140) |  So I was going to become an academician, a professional scholar of Buddhism. |
    | [00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=147) |  I passed my prelims for a PhD at the University of Wisconsin. |
    | [00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=153) |  So they sent me back to Japan to do research on a topic. |
    | [00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=159) |  I decided to pick the Shingon School of Buddhism, which is the Japanese version of Vajrayana |
    | [00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=166) |  practice, also known as Tantric Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism. |
    | [00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=171) |  I chose that because although many Westerners at that time were studying the Tibetan forms |
    | [00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=177) |  of Vajrayana practice, no one knew about or was studying the practice as it had been preserved |
    | [00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=185) |  in Japan for a thousand years. |
    | [00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=187) |  So I thought, okay, I'll make this my academic bailiwick, my specialty. |
    | [00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=192) |  I'll be the expert in the Western world on the Japanese version of Vajrayana practice. |
    | [00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=200) |  So I went there with that in mind, with that goal. |
    | [00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=205) |  But when I got there, they wouldn't teach me anything because it's for self-transformation, |
    | [00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=212) |  not just as an intellectual curiosity. |
    | [00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=216) |  So they said the only way that I could learn it is if I was willing to become a monk and |
    | [00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=223) |  live in the temple. |
    | [00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=225) |  So in order to be able to write my PhD thesis, I... |
    | [00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=229) |  You became a monk just so you could write your PhD thesis? |
    | [00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=233) |  Pretty much. |
    | [00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=235) |  But what happened is that my motivation shifted once I started to live in the temple and once |
    | [00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=243) |  I started to get some instruction in the practice, I realized there was a huge potential there |
    | [00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=251) |  for me personally. |
    | [00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=253) |  So they were very clever. |
    | [00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=254) |  They put me in this situation that turned me around. |
    | [00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=259) |  And then something happened, something happened in my personal life that pretty much blew |
    | [00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=264) |  me away emotionally and pointed out to me the absolute necessity of seeing beyond the |
    | [00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=275) |  body and the mind. |
    | [00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=277) |  And that happened while I was in that first year that I was a monk there in Japan. |
    | [00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=284) |  And that just changed everything for me. |
    | [00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=287) |  When I was in graduate school at Wisconsin, my hero was my graduate advisor. |
    | [00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=293) |  His name was Richard Robinson. |
    | [00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=296) |  And he was an intellectual giant, just an intellectual giant is all I could say. |
    | [00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=305) |  He could make puns in three languages simultaneously. |
    | [00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=309) |  His specialty was Buddhist logic. |
    | [00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=311) |  Yes, there is something called Buddhist logic. |
    | [00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=315) |  It's Aristotelian syllogistic logic that was used in the Madhyamaka school of Nagarjuna. |
    | [00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=324) |  Somewhat along the lines that the Greek Zeno school and so forth used logic to sort of |
    | [00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=333) |  show people beyond the world. |
    | [00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=337) |  What's beyond the world? |
    | [00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=338) |  Anyway, he was a master of that. |
    | [00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=341) |  And while I was a monk, I got this letter from the United States. |
    | [00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=346) |  He had been injured in a bizarre and horrific accident. |
    | [00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=353) |  A fuse blew out in his house and he went down to change it and there was no source of electricity. |
    | [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=361) |  So to light, he struck a match and there had been a gas leak there and it went up like |
    | [00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=367) |  a soccer torch and just burns all over his body and horrifically, if he had lived, he |
    | [00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=375) |  would have been horrifically deformed. |
    | [00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=378) |  He just suffered in agony for a month and then died. |
    | [00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=384) |  I thought to myself, what good is all that knowledge? |
    | [00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=391) |  What good is all that intelligence if this can happen at any time to a person? |
    | [00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=399) |  That made it real for me and gave me the motivation to want to see beyond the limited identity |
    | [00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=407) |  with the body and the mind. |
