{"text": " Did there continue to be flow in image space? Yes. As you focused on it, did it have any soothing qualities or not particularly? It was more neutral, I think. Okay, not particularly soothing. But you could detect the movement there. Mm-hmm. Now I'd like you to move your attention back into your head where you might hear internal conversations, which we'll call talk space. And are things pretty quiet right now, or is there chatter present? A little. There's a little chatter, but it's pretty quiet. Sometimes when things are quiet in talk space, there can be a sense of a kind of undercurrent of energy, a kind of rumbling or whispering deep down below the conscious talk. You've experienced that in the past. You know what I'm talking about. I'd like you to scope out and see if anything like that is present right now. It may or may not be. If it's not there, that's fine. It's not like an assignment to find it. But we're going to just see if there's any of that subtle vibratory flow, that pre-conscious talk thing. Anything like that at this time, or are things just pretty still and quiet? I had some. Then I had a tune visit me for a while, and then there was some talk. Explicit talk. So there's not a lot of that vibratory, subtle flow at this time. No. Is that correct? That's right. Okay, fine. Bring your attention back to the body, and see if the flow is still there with regards to the body. Yes. Good. Excellent. So, any questions about what we did so far? No. Okay, good. Now we're going to go through the same exercise, see if you can keep contact with the flow with your eyes open. Yes. Excellent. Now we're going to go to the next challenge level. See if you can keep contact with the flow and make eye contact with me. So it's more like an ordinary type situation. That's a lot. Yeah, you can do it. Excellent. So, this is pretty cool, huh? Any final questions or comments? No. Any time in your life in the future, if you have physical discomfort, you can remember that you can do things like this. And what I was doing is, I was doing exploratory work. I was like asking you questions, seeing what was going on, and then based on that I would like change the guidance and suggest certain things. First we checked out some local flow and then we found that it tended to spread through your body. So I was looking. I know that that's a tendency. It doesn't always happen. But if it does happen, it's significant because then the person can get this sort of whole body massage thing. Then I took a look to see if there was any fluidity in your mental experience. At this time there wasn't any. There wasn't any significance and there doesn't need to be. But sometimes a mind space will also flow. If that had been the case, I would have had you broaden your focus to zoom out and cover the whole mind and body as a single flow field. But that wasn't the case and we didn't need to do that. Are you still experiencing it now in the body? You've got your money's worth, right? The huge smile indicates the taste of purification and freedom from suffering. That's excellent work. So that's how it goes. Any final questions or comments? No. Okay. Well, we're done.
