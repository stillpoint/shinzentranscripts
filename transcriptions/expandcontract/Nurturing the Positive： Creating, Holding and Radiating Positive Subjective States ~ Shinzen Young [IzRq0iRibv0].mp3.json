{"text": " A final theme is to intentionally create, hold, and radiate positive states in feel-image-talk. You'll remember I described feel-image-talk as the core subjective system. That's the world of thought and emotion. We have internal control over it to a certain extent, particularly talk. We can decide to create a certain talk and repeat it over and over again. Essentially that's a mantra practice. But it's also a cognitive therapy practice. If you have irrational talk going on, irrational cognitions that are word-based, you can selectively attend to the antidote to that, which would be a more rational cognition. In cognitive behavioral therapy, that's what they have people do. I would say that that person is intentionally creating and holding positive talk, positive in the sense of rational as opposed to irrational, or appropriate as opposed to inappropriate. We can also hold positive images. Once again, they can be either more rational images, or they can be images of behavior changes or performance improvements that we would like to make, or images of outcomes that we would like to see happen, or images of symbols, archetypes that represent spiritual goals for us, or just images of people, places, objects that make us feel good, that activate pleasant emotional feel, that would be an antidote to uncomfortable emotions, depression, fear, and so forth. It's pretty easy for most people to intentionally create a positive dimension in talk and hold that. A little harder for image, but doable by many people. Feel is even harder, but it's doable. You can actually learn in a systematic way to turn on positive feel. By that I mean pleasant feel, that would be interest, joy, love, gratitude, those kinds of things, compassion. Intentionally creating, holding, and radiating positive states in one or a pair or all three of the fit system.
