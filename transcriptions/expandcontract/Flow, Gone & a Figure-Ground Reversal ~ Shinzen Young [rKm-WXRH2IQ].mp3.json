{"text": " Let's say that you decide, okay, you're going to just note flow. At first, you'll probably be aware of where the flow is, what's flowing, and so forth. But you may reach a point where you actually don't care and don't even know whether it's somatic, visual, or auditory. Those discriminations break down. Subjective versus objective breaks down. Ordinary versus restful breaks down. All you're interested in is just flow. You actually begin to lose specificity with regards to all the distinctions that we make in the other techniques. That's highly desirable. You can't make that happen. But there's really, you know how I always say it's a dialectical process. Half of the dialectic is making these discriminations in a healthy way. The other half is destroying the discriminations also in a healthy way. Flow is lecom platisil. It's the great leveler that destroys distinctions. The only greater leveler is gone. That destroys time and space. Can't have distinctions without time and space. You can still distinguish flavors of flow. Vibratory, undulatory. There's no different flavors of God. If you reach a point where you're noting flow and it's like sort of what I was describing. It's like all flow and you don't even know what it is or where it is or who you are or where you are, that now you're getting close to that figure ground reversal that I talked about last night. And good, go with that. Same deal with the gone. You can reach a point where you don't know what it is that's disappearing. You don't even know whether it was big or small. Pleasant, unpleasant, simple, complex. You forget about all that. You're just dominated by the vanishingness of things. And that once again leads to the figure ground reversal piece. That was what you were starting to experience. And if you get the combined where it's flow, go, flow, go, flow, go, that's all you're with, then that's going to lead to that experience of there's this matrix of nothingness that is birthing self and scene moment by moment inside that rhythm of flow and go, flow and go. When there's go, there's nothing. And then it breaks apart and it sort of scintillates and that scintillating mist, if it gets coagulated, we call it a self in a world. If it doesn't get coagulated, we call it pure spirit. And part of it is constantly spreading out effortlessly. Part of it is constantly pulling in effortlessly. It's a fountain of youth, invisible doing. So that would be the flow gone, flow gone. You combine the two together.
