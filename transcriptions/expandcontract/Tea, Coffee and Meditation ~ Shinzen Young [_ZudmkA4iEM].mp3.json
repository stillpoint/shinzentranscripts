{"text": " We need a few more swigs. Forget about the instant level, we're not even at room temperature. It is certainly historically the case that the custom of drinking tea was introduced from China into Japan in association with Zen. It was the Song Dynasty style of making tea, which is the powdered tea that's in with the matcha in the Japanese pronunciation. That came in with the initial introduction of Zen at that same period that I was talking about in Japan in the 12th, 13th century and so forth. However, China had had tea prior to that, and I don't know to what extent it was drunk in Japan. I mean, everybody says it came in the Kamakura period with Zen from China. But tea goes back at least as far as the Tang Dynasty. But in the Tang Dynasty, they made it into bricks. It's like a brick, and I guess you pull it apart like the bole, the chao bing. They're very expensive. They come from, actually not too far from where Philip's ancestors come from, in South China. I've had those, and somebody will tell you that this is like $2,000 in bole, brick tea. But then later on in the Ming Dynasty, they started to steep the leaves, and that's called sencha. That was introduced into Japan also by a school of Zen, the Obaku school of Zen, that came in at the transition between the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the early Tokugawa period. So there's been like three different ways that tea was made, brick, powdered, and then just leaf, which is the modern way. And two of those ways were introduced by different streams of Zen that came into Japan. There's no problem with the stimulant if the choice is the Zen lurch and the keisaku beating. So the alternative is, well, a little stimulant. Now in fact, sometimes business magazines like Fast Company and whatever, they do stories on Green Mountain Mindfulness program, my program, and the slant they always use is, isn't this weird? A coffee company is teaching tranquility, how strange is that kind of thing? When I think of meditation, yeah, there's a tranquility component, but there's also a clarity alertness component. And then some people get jangly if they drink stimulants, so of course that's not good in that case. But that doesn't seem to happen to me, so it works out. I've never closely researched the history, but I've heard sort of anecdotally that coffee fulfilled the same role in the Islamic Sufi meditative tradition as the matcha did for the Zen, but I'd have to look that up and see if that's really true.
