{"text": " Impermanence is not just a characteristic of sensory experience. Impermanence is a kind of energy that is a vital energy that you can learn to ride on. In other words, impermanence is chi. And so the idea in the Zen style of experiencing impermanence is, yes, it's the same deconstructive thing I described, but then you're also interested not just in form as emptiness, but you're very interested in how emptiness becomes form, moment by moment, bre-ay yesh me-ayin, to use the Hebrew Kabbalistic term, how there's a rising of something from nothing. Well, the nothing repolarizes into this kind of energy, and in Zen they want you to ride on that energy, not just to observe impermanence as an object, but to literally become impermanence. And there is a kind of bouncy, springy vitality to the experience of emptiness as it is encouraged in the Zen tradition. And that was fostered by a certain rhythm of practice, if you've ever been to Zen retreats, where you're never allowed to fixate. In Vipassana we move so slow that you disappear. In Zen you move so fast that you disappear. And the idea is that you're, I would almost say, although this may sound a little bit inscrutable, that in mindfulness practice you first observe impermanence, and then down the line, hopefully, you'll learn to ride on impermanence and live it, have it animate you. But in Zen, the style of the monastery, the style of the training, with its spontaneity and its demand to perform without thinking, what that does is that causes you to ride on impermanence. And if you live impermanence in that lifestyle, then eventually you'll be able to see impermanence in your sensory experience. It's almost like they approach the same issue from opposite directions. So Zen has a kind of bouncy vitality to it, and a kind of \u00e9clat or creativity that is characteristic of it. Sometimes the Hinayana form of Buddhism, the Vipassana, it's sort of like prosaic and sort of like, I don't know, low-key and dull and boring, but it's like a good, it gets the job done. It's like a carefully crafted essay. But Zen stylistically is like an energetic poem. So it's a whole different style of enlightenment, a whole different expression of enlightenment, yet it's the same enlightenment.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.0, "text":
