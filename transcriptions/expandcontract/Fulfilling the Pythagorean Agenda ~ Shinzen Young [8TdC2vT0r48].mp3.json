{"text": " What is the origin of the word civilization? At the beginning of Western civilization, there was, back in the 6th century BC in Greece, was Pythagoras. And Pythagoras had a remarkable notion. A notion that somehow the nature of the material world and the nature of the inner world of thought, emotion, and spirit and the nature of number were somehow linked. And if you could figure that out, then you would have a complete model that would cover all the needs of humanity. One of the problems, there were, as I look upon it, three problems. One is his notion of the nature of number was too limited. Essentially, it was positive whole integers. The second is that they didn't have the experimental method to explore nature. That only developed with Galileo, Francis Bacon, Newton, and his optics, for example, and then subsequent researchers, scientists. And the other thing ancient Greeks lacked was methods of developing enough concentration power systematically to explore the nature of the inner world. So they didn't know how to make experiments to explore the nature of the outer world. And they didn't have the technology of high concentration that India did have that you need in order to explore the inner world. And they didn't have an adequate concept of number in order to model either one. But I think that we now are in a position to fulfill the Pythagorean agenda because we now have a notion of number that's broad enough. Both the outer dance and the inner dance can be modeled with our present number system because it has enough contrasts built in to explore the different flavors of expansion and contraction. The West has discovered the concentration methods from the East. We have the experimental method for looking at the outside nature. There's a teaching in Mahayana Buddhism that all beings have the Buddha nature. The Greek word for nature, the thing that Pythagoras and Western civilization from his time on wanted to study, the word was physis, and that's given us the word physics, for example. Physics is the study of the nature of things. I think that the confluence of the empirical method, the focus techniques from the East, empirical means experimental method, and the ability to mathematically model the results of experiments on the outside, and now in this century we'll start to model the results of experiments on the inside mathematically, we'll be able to achieve the Pythagorean agenda. As a result of that, it's easy for me to imagine that there could be, I don't say this will happen because who knows, I just say it's not hard for me to imagine that the human condition in the next century could change rapidly and globally and dramatically for the better. I think that every one of us that follows this path has a little role, perhaps, in what could be one of the most important events in all of history.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0,
