{"text": " As you know, I like to describe the practice in terms of contrast. The practice is born between, like a lot of things, like maybe everything. One of the things it's born between is the interplay of efforting and dropping effort. Another thing it's born between is working with parts and working with wholes. So if you get really good at working with parts, that's going to impact your ability to work with the whole without making so much effort. What you're describing in this global awareness where there's a lot of mindfulness and it's covering vast experience, but you aren't having to make an effort very much to keep track of things, that's the momentum of that local work that you did, working with the individual parts, which was efforting. That coming together with the practice of do nothing, which was its own practice, those develop a certain momentum. So when you start working with the whole and you're not efforting to penetrate the parts, you're working with the whole, but a momentum of clarity is present from having worked with the parts effortingly and you're maintaining a minimum effort, which you know how to do because you've practiced the no effort whatsoever. Now you get this delicious thing that's in between, where it's half like do nothing, but it has all of the crispness of a bear down, like, okay, penetrate this sensation kind of practice. That's why I said, good, what you're reporting is essentially what I hope is going to happen with time.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 15.0, "text": " As you know, I like to
