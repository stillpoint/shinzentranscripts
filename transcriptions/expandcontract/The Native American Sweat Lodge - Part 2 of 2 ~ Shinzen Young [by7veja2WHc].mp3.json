{"text": " Yes, a stone axe is in some sense more primitive than a steel axe. So I guess the assumption among the Europeans when they came to the Americas was, well, their axes are more primitive than ours, therefore their consciousness must be more primitive than ours. And once you've participated in their ceremony, you don't know whether to laugh or cry at that notion, because it is so deep and so subtle. On the surface, it's a prayer ceremony. It's also a physical cleansing. It's also a shared group's sort of group therapy, because people talk and their defenses are down. It is a shamanic journey into the power realms, because of the altered states that you may enter. At a deeper level, it is purification of consciousness through having equanimity with strong sensations, both physical and emotional sensations come up. And within the context of the ceremony, the ceremony induces a mindful state, and therefore consciousness is purified. Purification equals sensation multiplied by equanimity fits in my model perfectly. So that's at a very deep level. And at the deepest level, it's an experience of the flow of nature in terms of the fundamental forces of expansion and contraction. They may use different words. They use father sky, mother earth, or they talk about the bowl of the pipe versus the stem of the pipe, the earth versus the tree. But everything is built on an interplay of a flow of affirmation and negation. I've even heard native people talk about yin and yang, actually use those words in the ceremonies because of their education, that they've learned of concepts from East Asia and so forth and see how they map on. In fact, the word inipi in the Lakota language, I said it means a tool for life, but the stem ni in Lakota, Lakota, if you're not familiar with the term, is the Western Sioux. Ni means life, but it also means breath, and it also means the sort of flowing energy of spirit that would be vibrating, expanding, contracting, and so forth. So the whole ceremony is built around merging with the fundamental flow of the expansive sky and the contractive earth and the vibrating energy that's born in between them. So it's the essence of mindfulness practice as I understand it. And on top of that, it's fun. It's colorful. It's shared with a group. Buddhist practice is sort of, well, I mean, there's the subtle sharing that happens on a silent retreat, but it's sort of like silent, you're with yourself. This is not a subtle sharing. You're singing. You're like really singing, okay? And people are crying and people are saying things because their defenses are down, and then everybody is affirming them. They're saying, that's good. Yeah, that brother, good. It's like this shared support structure that you have. It's very communal. So it makes the perfect complement to the Buddhist practice. The Buddhist practice gives you systematic techniques for doing things. They don't have those systematic techniques because they don't need those systematic techniques. They just do these ceremonies. They don't have the concepts of purification equals plain plus equanimity, multiplied by clarity, et cetera. They just do the ceremonies, okay? They don't need the terminology. They don't have to have a philosophical system about the fundamental oneness of things. They just say, all my relations, okay? And that sums it all up, okay? We're all related. It's like, oh, so this is what they mean by primitive religion, okay? In other words, this so-called primitive religion is really subtle, multi-layered, goes down to the deepest, from the most surface to the deepest in a single integrated ceremony. It's like so impressive as a spiritual vehicle. So I knew this is for me. It was 27 years ago, and it's been true. I've been doing these ceremonies with native people wherever I can, wherever I run a retreat, when there is someone that can do it in the traditional way, I make it available for our retreatants. My metaphor is that for me, the Buddhist practice will always be the cake, sort of the substance, but I like a little frosting on my cake. And the Native American ceremonies in general, specifically the sweat lodge, represents that frosting on the cake for me.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.16, "text": " Yes,
