{"text": " What is the difference between positive and negative? Very good point. Because normally it's like what I have people to do when they're freaking out in pain and emotions and things. But if you do it in positive, then it turns into bliss city. How can I do it with restful? You just need to notice that physiologically it has to happen or the out-breath won't occur. So when you breathe out locally in the core of your body, there's automatic relaxation. As that's happening, if you spread awareness to how the whole body is also settled, the five limbs, the two arms, the two legs and the head, that's actually an example of zoom in and out on a restful state. The restfulness from the core spreads and affects the whole body. So each out-breath just completely inundates you with physical relaxation. And that's a zoom in out on a restful flavor.
