{"text": " What is wisdom? The wisdom voice is the wisdom activity percolating up to the surface, communicating in the only way that it can, through image or talk, talk in this case, and that's Prajna. That's what is meant by Prajna. It simply wells up and takes that form, or you're channeling it. People say, you know, well, I got out of the car, I moved without thinking. It was a movement that just happened. So you can have thinking without thinking. It's a thought that just happens, and it comes from the same spontaneous place, and it will talk to us that way, and then eventually it will start to come out of our lips also. If it's lofty, then it's Indic style. Different cultures have different wisdom voices. If it's homey, then it's the Zen style, down to earth. If it's quirky and humorous, that's the Jewish wisdom voice.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.0, "text": " What is wisdom?", "tokens": [708, 307, 10712, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3841053889347957, "compression_ratio": 1.4899328859060403, "no_speech_prob": 0.02812308818101883}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 8.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " The wisdom voice is the wisdom activity percolating up to the surface,", "tokens": [440, 10712, 3177, 307, 264, 10712, 5191, 680, 8768, 990, 493, 281, 264, 3753, 11], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3841053889347957, "compression_ratio": 1.4899328859060403, "no_speech_prob": 0.02812308818101883}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 14.0, "end": 20.0, "text": " communicating in the only way that it can, through image or talk, talk in this case,", "tokens": [17559, 294, 264, 787, 636, 300, 309, 393, 11, 807, 3256, 420, 751, 11, 751, 294, 341, 1389, 11], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.3841053889347957, "compression_ratio": 1.4899328859060403, "no_speech_prob": 0.02812308818101883}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 20.0, "end": 25.0, "text": " and that's Prajna.
