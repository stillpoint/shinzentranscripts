{"text": " If you think of the spiritual journey as a journey from surface to source, in making that journey, some people will have blissful dissolution, that they just sort of dissolve back into the flow and go of the source. Some people have these horrific dissolutions that if they can stay with it, then become blissful and eventually just purely blissful. Some people get a mixture of both, and some are not particularly aware of going through a dissolution process, so it's not required. I do talk about these things and other teachers talk about them because we want to give you the heads up, just in case it happens to you. Basically, you need to know two things, why is this happening and what am I going to do about it? So we do talk about it. The advantage is that if it does happen, you know why it's happening and what to do about it. But the disadvantage is, if we talk about it, some people listening will say, that hasn't happened to me yet, so I must be the child of a lesser god, I'm not really making progress. They're not missing that. Well, it depends. Not always as rough as you had. People think, well, I haven't experienced that so I must not be making progress, so there's that problem. And then other people think, oh my god, I hope that doesn't happen to me, and there's that problem. And then other people are thinking, wow, I wish that would happen to me. There are problems involved in explicitly talking about these phenomena. It scares people or it creates craving or comparison mind. But I think it's still worth talking about. Definitely. Get it out there. Because I think if you wouldn't have been there, I would have gone for psychiatric help. And that could have had tragic consequences because... They may not have understood. There's actually something called the Spiritual Emergence Network, you know about this, that was created because they realized people who were having spiritual experiences didn't have someone to talk to. They go into the mental health system, while those mental health professionals in prior times didn't know about this stuff. And the Spiritual Emergence Network was designed to inform mental health professionals that hey, just because somebody's reporting the kind of things you're reporting doesn't necessarily mean they're losing their marbles and that they necessarily need to be put in chemical restraints. I can see the importance of that. You know, there could have been horrific consequences or tragic consequences if you had gotten somebody that didn't understand the difference between dissolution and insanity. I would say the single most important thing if a person goes through an experience like this is you've got to have somebody to talk to who's actually themselves been through it. I made it through to the other end. That's like, that's the cure. Okay, more than anything it's like, okay, find somebody who's actually experienced this. Then they'll take you through it. Isn't that what I said I would do? And you're more or less through it, aren't you? I mean, you had a little recurrence today, but... It's taken on a different texture. That initial destabilization is still going on in different areas in my life. But you've acclimatized. Well, every time you acclimatize to something or some fixed reference point, that seems to, the carpet gets pulled out. Zen master Rinzai talked about finding that true person within you who has no fixed position. Wu wei zhen ran. That's what you're being called on to do. Those are great words, and I've read a hundred spiritual books that thought, wow, I'd like to be free. I want to find that true person within me that has no fixed position. Be careful what you pray for. Absolutely, because it's not like I have ever imagined. There is no informed consent to enlightenment. It's both not as good as, and much better than, you fantasized. And I realized that for most of my life, my spiritual model was wrong, in that I was a person, an ego, that was going to have more awareness, that I was going to make a better me, a new, improved me, with more consciousness. You were going to polish a brick into a mirror. I was going to be a better, new, improved version of myself. But instead you discovered that you're a brick that gets smashed into a trillion pieces and vaporized. And what I realized is that it's not that some kind of perfection gets added to me. I get erased. I get erased, and the perfection that was always there becomes clear and starts to shine. That's called a figure-ground reversal. And that's wisdom that's speaking through you now, to say those words. That's exactly how it works. I would never have guessed it from reading the books. Can you repeat that? I interrupted you. That was really good. No, just what you said. You thought it was... Well, I always thought spirituality was adding something, becoming bigger and bigger. More consciousness, more power, more clarity, more focus, more success in my life. And then I realized that what spirituality is about is not having a self that has that at all. And that those powerful qualities are just always there in creation all the time when you step out of the way. And the price for that is? Everything. As T.S. Eliot said. Everything you ever believed in, everything you ever thought you were. It's a very humbling experience. But I wouldn't give it up for anything at this point. I want to thank you for kicking me into this place, for jump-starting.
