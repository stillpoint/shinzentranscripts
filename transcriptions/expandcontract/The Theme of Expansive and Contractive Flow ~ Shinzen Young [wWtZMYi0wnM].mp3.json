{"text": " What is the relationship between change and force? It can happen in our sensory experience that we could be aware of change and the forces and energy that produce change. I call that aspect, that theme, the dynamic aspect of experience. If the change has the form of an abrupt diminishing, then I call that a vanishing, even if it doesn't completely vanish. And all the other aspects of change I call flow. Now, there's lots of different flavors of flow. Flow can be sort of like bubbly or it could be wavy and so forth. But in the formulation that I like to use, behind all the different flavors of flow are two oppositely directed flavors of flow that we'll refer to abstractly as expansion and contraction. Sasaki Roshi has a list of several dozen synonyms for this contrast. Many of the synonyms are confusing, don't seem to have anything to do with the other synonyms, and sort of wig people out. But what he's trying to do is point out that many things that superficially appear to be unrelated, in fact at a deep level, reflect these two sides of nature. He'll sometimes call them purasu, purasu to mainasu. Can you understand purasu? Purasu. Mainasu. Yes, to means and, so purasu to mainasu. Interestingly, very seldom will he ever say yo to yin. Yin to yo. Yin is yin and yo is yang. Although clearly these are related to the Taoist yin and yang. But very seldom does he say yin yo. He prefers to use the English mainasu purasu. But behind it is obviously the Taoist background of East Asian thought. Mixed with the Indic element of the notion that there's a cancellation of yin and yang called zero. Expansion is the principle of increase. Contraction is the principle of decrease. Expansion is the principle of outward movement, outward force. Contraction is the principle of inward movement, inward force. So that means that as you're paying attention to sensory experience, if anything increases, that's expansion. So expansion isn't this mysterious thing that someday if you finally grow up you'll be able to experience. If you have a pain and it's getting bigger, that's expansion. If you're listening to a sound and it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller as the airplane goes away, that's contraction. Don't tell me you never experienced expansion or contraction. Any increase, any decrease represents these underlying principles. So what can increase? Well, intensity level can increase. Of what? Anything. The talk in your head, pain in your body, hot, cold, light. So expansion, contraction. No more mysterious than that. One thing that it can increase and decrease is intensity level. What else can increase and decrease? Well, vibrations can speed up and slow down. The talk in your head can get louder and softer but it can also get faster or slower. The spiking pain in your knee can spike at a certain level, then it can speed up a whole lot, then it can slow down a little bit. So the sort of frequency of something can increase or decrease. In your body you may be aware of pressures. If you take any pressure, you can analyze it, ask yourself is it outward, inward or both at the same time. Frequently it's both at the same time and frequently they're clashing, producing a sense of discomfort. But that's okay, those are still forces, expansion, contraction forces. Have you noticed that your mind can be scattered in many directions? And that it can obsess on one thing? That can be looked upon as a problem or that can simply be looked upon as a manifestation of expansion and contraction. And not a problem, just part of the flow of nature. What happens if the attention is scattered in many directions at once? If the attention is scattered in many directions at once and you're focused on the fact that it's scattered, then you have high concentration on expansion. And yes, you let that happen with this technique. And you give up the need to have order and you just let yourself be sort of always at once kind of thing. But there is concentration and clarity. You're clear that you're scattered and you're focused on how you're blown in all directions at once. So yes, with this technique, let that happen. And if you can't get off something and you're like nailed to it, you can parse that as the contractive force and not fight with it. Most importantly, the spatial scope of a sensory phenomenon can increase or decrease. As I have set up these categories, touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, every one of them has depth, width and height. Now the depth, width and height, I've set up in the first category, has depth, width and height. Now the depth, width and height might not be well defined. It might be sort of cloud-like and nebulous. But there's a right-left measure, there's a front-back measure, there's an up-down measure, roughly for any of the spaces. Even the mind has a front and a back. There's a visual part that tends to appear in front and an auditory part that tends to be more posterior, relative to that. Talk space, not very well defined spatially, but image space, you've got the images in the center of image space, the images around you, the images of your own body. That's space. The space occupied by a sensory event may increase or decrease. Usually it does one or the other. Very seldom do all three dimensions of a sensory volume remain completely fixed. So if it gets a little wider, expansion. If it gets a little narrower, contraction. If it gets a little larger in the front-back dimension, deeper, depth increases, expansion. Depth decreases, contraction. Lengthens, expansion. Shortens, contraction. Lengthens and at the same time pulls in to the sides in the front and back? Both. It's expanding in one dimension, contracting along the other. If you take spaghetti dough or something and you pull it, it will expand and contract at the same time. Any change in spatial volume along one, two or all three of the axes counts as expansion and contraction. For anything. Touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk or the corresponding restful states for that matter. The increase and decrease in intensities, the increase and decrease in frequencies, the inwards and outwards pressures in the body, the scattering and gripping forces in the mind, in the end all present themselves, if you look carefully, as stretchings and or squeezings of the spatial volume of experience. A spatial volume of sensory experience. If you have a pain, you can measure it, its width, its depth, its height. Take that all together, that's its spatial volume. So things squinch in along one dimension, they pull out along another dimension. And sometimes the whole spatial volume can increase, the whole spatial volume can decrease. All three axes at once spreading, collapsing. When you become very sensitive to the moment of arising of a sensory event, you see that as that sensory event transitions from non-existence into existence, it occupies, it creates a volume of space. And when that sensory event disappears completely, that volume of space disappears, that it occupies. If you totally, 100% affirm a sensory event at the moment of arising, if you're just like instantly with it and instantly giving the big yes, then you'll see that as soon as it's arising, it's not just a moment of arising, but that as soon as it's arising, it's already passing. Already passing. It's arising and its beginning is its end, as T.S. Eliot said. As it's arising, it's already passing. That means there's a simultaneous growth of spatial volume and a shrinkage of spatial volume right behind that in time. So that it's both moving out and in at the same time. I just give this to you as a heads up. There is nothing in the world that you can do to make that experience available. But you now have a vocabulary and a languaging, just in case you should ever notice that as soon as something is arising, it's also passing. Temporally, its space is expanding and its space is contracting right behind that at the same time, producing a bidirectional flux. At a local level, that will often take the form of biflow and then a complete disappearance, a vanishing. So both gone, both gone, both gone. At a local level. That sums at a global level to an experience of everything is simultaneously born in between expanding, contracting spirit flow. And that expanding, contracting spirit flow is peppered with trillions of vanishings that give it a profound tranquility at the same time. So it literally goes everywhere. Everywhere meaning as far out as out and as far in as in can be and goes nowhere at exactly the same time. That's the theme of expansive, contractive flow. Thousands and thousands of human beings over the centuries have become completely enlightened without ever once using the word expansion and contraction. So don't make a big deal out of this. It's just a theme that can be explored.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.0, "text": " What is the relationship between change and force?", "tokens": [708, 307, 264, 2480, 1296, 1319, 293, 3464, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.6359366868671618, "compression_ratio": 1.3934426229508197, "no_speech_prob": 0.01107355859130621}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 6.0, "end": 21.0, "text": " It can happen in our sensory experience that we could be aware of change and the forces and energy that produce change.", "tokens": [467, 393, 1051, 294, 527, 27233, 1752, 300, 321, 727, 312, 3650, 295, 1319, 293, 264, 5874, 293, 2281, 300, 5258, 1319, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.6359366868671618, "compression_ratio": 1.3934426229508197, "no_speech_prob": 0.01107355859130621}, {"id": 2, "seek": 2100, "start": 21.0, "end": 31.0, "text": " I call that aspect, that theme, the dynamic aspect of experience.", "tokens": [286, 818, 300, 4171, 11, 300, 6314, 11, 264, 8546, 4171, 295, 1752, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2183793584505717, "compression_ratio": 1.488, "no_speech_prob": 5.824851541547105e-05}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2100, "start": 32.0, "end": 43.0, "text": " If the change has the form of an abrupt diminishing, then I call that a vanishing, even if it doesn't completely vanish.", "tokens": [759, 264, 1319, 575, 264, 1254, 295, 364, 33401, 15739, 3807, 11, 550, 286, 818, 300, 257, 3161, 3807, 11, 754, 498, 309, 1177, 380, 2584, 43584, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2183793584505717, "compression_ratio": 1.488, "no_speech_prob": 5.824851541547105e-05}, {"id": 4, "seek": 4300, "start": 43.0, "end": 52.0, "text": " And all the other aspects of change I call flow.
