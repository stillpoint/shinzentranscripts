{"text": " How did you discover positive feeling? We started with having you explore just the spontaneous presence of positive feel in your body, which you did, and actually you were able to do that to a certain extent. But then it went away and it didn't come back, which is not uncommon. Finding positive feel is only one way to go about the technique of working with positive feel. Another thing that you can do is you can intentionally create positive feel and then focus on it. One of the easiest ways to create positive feel is to briefly, intentionally make a positive thought that's likely to make you happy or loving or joyous and so forth. Thought is something you have control over. Thought is your mental image and your internal talk or both at the same time. So you briefly think a thought that's likely to give you a pleasant feel, and it could be anything of your choice. Then you sort of drop that and you tune into how that pleasant feel may continue to resonate in your body even after you've dropped the thought. Then you focus in on it, the same way we focused in on the pleasant feel that was just there spontaneously. But in this case, if the sort of resonance of positive feel goes away, then you think the same thought or a different thought just briefly, just enough to get the body vibrating again with a momentum of pleasant feel. I call that triggering the positive feel by a brief intentional thought. Does that make sense as a concept? Yes. You may have to make the intentional thought frequently, or it may be that your body is emotionally very resonant. So just like you think a positive thought and maybe for 30 seconds or 3 minutes, your body continues to resonate, and now you're focusing in on it with concentration and so forth. The metaphor that I use for that is if we imagine that your emotional body is a bell. This is your emotional body bell, and it's sort of passive. It just responds, and this is your thought, which you have control over. If you briefly think a positive thought, that's going to resonate. That's like striking the emotional body bell. Then you can tune into the resonance for as long as it may last, then strike again if need be. We're going to do it for the fun of it with external sound. I'm going to strike it, and then I'd like you to listen to it until it's completely\u2014 there's no more resonance anymore. I'll do the same. Gone. But we could strike it again as need be. Does that make sense? Very good. We'll call that triggering positive feel. But our focus isn't the thought. Our focus is still pure body. We're training your emotional circuits to strengthen the positive emotional muscles, so to speak. It's like physical therapy. A lot of people, if they don't exercise muscles, they atrophy, and then you have to give them physical therapy, and then those muscles get strong. There's sort of like positive emotional circuitry within our brain, but if we don't exercise it, it might atrophy. People that are depressed, for example, or whatever. This exercise that I'm showing you is a sort of emotional physiotherapy. It strengthens the atrophied circuits and gives you a tendency\u2014it imparts to your body a tendency to go to positive emotional experience as opposed to negative. So should I be trying to aim it at different parts of my body? As a general principle, when you detect the pleasant feel with this technique, you try to intentionally spread your attention as broadly as you can within it. In fact, if possible, you try to experience it over your whole body. If possible, but you can't force that. So however wide it may be present in your body\u2014right, left, front, back, up, down\u2014you sort of stretch your attention over it. If it gets really strong, which it will with practice, it will fill your whole body. Then when it gets really strong, it will seem to be larger than your body, like it's radiating out into all six directions. You're sort of like this high-wattage transmitter. Then you start walking through the world like that, and that has an influence. That's an advanced level of the practice. Make sense? At least conceptually. Sounds like a pretty good idea, right?
