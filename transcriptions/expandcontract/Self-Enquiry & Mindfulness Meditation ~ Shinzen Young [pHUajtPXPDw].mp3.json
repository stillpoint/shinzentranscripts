{"text": " How does self-inquiry relate to mindfulness practice? Someone wrote in asking, how does self-inquiry relate to mindfulness practice? It's a really interesting question. In a sense, it would seem like they're very, very different. If you're not familiar with what's meant by self-inquiry, actually there's a range of traditions that teach it, including Zen, some Zen teachers, but also many people working within the Hindu tradition, the non-dual tradition, and so forth. Basic idea is you're constantly asking a question like, who am I or what am I? Whatever comes up, you're saying, well, who's experiencing this? What's experiencing this? You're having a thought, well, where did the thought come from? Who's thinking this thought? It's an approach that's been discovered independently in a number of cultures, used all around the world, actually. As I mentioned, there's some Zen teachers that teach it. There's also within the Hindu fold, and then people not affiliated with either Hinduism or Buddhism would give you a similar kind of model. As I say, they all have the same basic idea, it's like turn consciousness back on itself, turn the awareness back on itself. That would seem to be a very different practice from mindfulness. Mindfulness asks you to keep track of what's going on. However, if you really look deeply into what mindfulness practice is about, you will see that there's an interesting symmetry between self-inquiry on one hand and mindfulness on the other hand. It is true that the initial experiences that a person has when they do mindfulness can be described as, I'm a meditator over here observing stuff over there. However, with time, two very significant things take place. One is that the habit of meditating begins to meditate. In other words, there's not so much that sense of, there has to be an I here doing the meditation. There's a momentum of concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity, those three things. A momentum of that builds up and it just carries itself. One important change that takes place with time, with mindfulness practice, is that sense of efforting and thinking that you initially needed in order to observe things, that goes away and there is just the observing. Just the clarity, well, if you want to call it observing, there's just the concentration, clarity, and equanimity. That's one change. A second change is that you develop a sensitivity to what's called impermanence. Now sometimes impermanence can be sort of continuous or vibratory or wavy, but another aspect of impermanence is noting the moment when things vanish. If you read the classic Visuddhimagga, for example, the path of purification written in probably the 5th century in Sri Lanka by Buddhakosa, he talks about a stage where your awareness is dominated by rising and passing, and then a stage where your awareness is dominated by just passing. You're just aware of endings, endings, endings. In my vocabulary, I have people note it as ko. It's nothing mystical shmistical. You've all experienced it. You pay attention to your internal conversation as soon as you notice the talk arises, it sort of vanishes. Mental images disappear. Sounds come to an end. It's no big deal. Something everybody experiences, but you can reach a point in your practice where that you become really, really aware of how many vanishings there are in things that you thought were quite solid. So at some point, you're just noting gone, gone, gone, gone. The place, each time you're noting a vanishing, for just a moment, your attention is adverted, that is to say, turned towards the source of consciousness. Because where something goes to when it vanishes is where it comes from when it arises. So if you want to turn the attention towards the source, you can take one of two strategies. You can say, A has arisen. Now let's look back and see where A came from. That's one way to go about it. That would be the self-inquiry way. And it's very powerful. It works very well for some people. But it doesn't necessarily work well for everyone. Another way to go about it is, well, instead of saying, A is arising, where did A come from, constantly asking that. Another way to go about it is, A has arisen. Now A disappears. Watch A disappear. And that spot is going to be where B arises from. So you watch the vanishing piece. And if you want to be present at the very instant of the arising of B, you can do that by noticing the vanishing of A, the thing that preceded it. That's the gone of A is the origin of B. A and B meaning any two successive sensory experiences, big or small. That's what I meant when I said that there's a kind of symmetry between the two ways of working. So within the mindfulness tradition, there is actually something that more or less corresponds to self-inquiry. And it's hugely, hugely important. But it's not done with the model of keep looking back, keep looking back at where things are coming from. It's done with the model of keep watching where they go to when they pass away.
