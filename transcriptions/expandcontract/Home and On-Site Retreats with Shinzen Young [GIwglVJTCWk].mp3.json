{"text": " People have been writing in questions to this channel about what happens at my retreats. So I'd like to talk a little bit about what you can expect if you do a retreat with me. I do two kinds of retreats, actually. One is an on-site type situation, which is more like the traditional way of teaching for householders, where you come to a venue. Often it will be a residential situation where you stay overnight, although not inevitably. It might be a commuter type situation where you come in for one day or a weekend, but you go home. But I call those on-site retreats because I'm physically present there. So I do on-site retreats around the world, mostly in North America. You can find the schedule for those at the website shinzen.org. Then I do another kind of retreat that I call the Home Practice Program. That comes to you by conference call. You do that from wherever you are in the world. You register for those retreats by going to basicmindfulness.org. The whole program is explained there. That's a really cool program because it takes away all of the showstoppers, the speed bumps that people have with regards to doing the other kinds of retreats. For an on-site type retreat, you need to leave your home, leave your family, incur loss of job time, incur perhaps travel expenses, loss of income, and so forth in a troubled economy that can be problematic. Also, people don't want to be away from their families. Their schedules don't allow for travel. You might not be a center in their area. You might be living in a part of the world where you don't have even a place you could go to do something like that. Or you might be disabled, you can't leave your house. So we wanted to create a delivery system for what I call industrial strength but user-friendly meditation that anybody can have regardless of their familial, work, financial, or health situation or geographic situation. So that's the home practice program. You register for that and we give you an access code and a telephone number to call at the appointed time. Most of those are done in four-hour blocks. Just about anybody can get four hours during a month to do the practice. And that's a second delivery system. If you come to a residential retreat with me or a commuter retreat with me, in other words, if you do an on-site type program, you have the advantage of a buildup of momentum and so forth. If you do a home practice program, you have the advantage of enormous convenience. Sometimes people ask, well, if I go to one of his on-site retreats, will I have to practice his techniques? And the answer is absolutely no, not required. At my retreats, you are free to practice whatever form of meditation you wish. A lot of people come to my programs because they want to learn my approaches and my techniques, the so-called five-way system of basic mindfulness that I teach. And you will have a chance, of course, to learn that, but it is by no means required that you practice that, either at the retreat or for your own self-practice. It's been my experience over the years of teaching that different things work for different people at different times in their spiritual itinerary. So my basic motto about what to do, if you were to ask me, well, how should I meditate, how should I practice, I would say do what works. I'm not alone in this regard. Another senior teacher, Joseph Goldstein, wrote a book called One Dharma, and basically that's, if you had to sum it up in a soundbite, that's what the book is about. And that's been my conclusion also. Do what works. So no, you don't have to do any of the five ways at my retreats. The way I think of the organization of the practice is I have this system of five approaches, and then there's everything else that anybody ever did that worked. So I divide all ways of practicing into the five ways, which in some ways is just a modernization of a whole bunch of old stuff, so stuff that sort of fits within that framework. And then anything else that doesn't fit within that framework, I refer to them as special exercises. You can mix the five ways with special exercises. You can mix it with whatever you want to do. You're just totally free to practice as you wish. So I like people that study with me as the result of having studied with me, not to become a devotee of my way of teaching, but rather to see the commonality within all the ways of teaching so that they can be comfortable with anybody's program. They can make use of everybody's program. From my perspective, there's only one teacher in the universe through all times. There's just one teacher, and she is the thousand-armed, thousand-headed goddess of compassion. And each one of us individual teachers sort of represents one head and a couple of arms on that single archetype. And if you look at the\u2014this is Avalokiteshvara, or Kannon in Japanese, Guanyin in Chinese, Guanam in Korean, and Guan Am in Vietnamese, and Chenresi in Tibetan, known by many names, sometimes actually male, but often in East Asia, female. So I call her the thousand-armed goddess of compassion. If you look at this particular archetype, you'll see each one of her hands has a different attribute, a different object, a different symbol. And to me, that represents all the different approaches that different teachers have developed over the ages. But we're all limbs on one formless activity that pervades time and space. Each one of us contributes as best we can to this overall activity. So my job as a teacher is to set you up to see things that way, so that we, all of us teachers, can share this huge job that needs to be done for the world.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0,
