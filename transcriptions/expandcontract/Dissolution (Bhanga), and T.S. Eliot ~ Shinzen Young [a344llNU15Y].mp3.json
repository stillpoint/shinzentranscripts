{"text": " There's an experience that some people have in their spiritual path that in the Pali language is called Bhanga, B-H-A-N-G-A. Pali is an ancient Indian language, the one in which the earliest Buddhist writings are preserved. Bhanga means dissolution, literally, and it's reported all over the world. It is by no means distinctive to Buddhist practice. In fact, it's pretty central to a lot of shamanic paths in different tribal cultures. The dissolution or Bhanga experience has two sides to it. On one hand, it can be unbelievably blissful because your whole body dissolves into champagne bubbles, this pleasant vibratory energy. Not just your whole body, your whole body and your whole mind, or maybe even not just your body and your mind, but even your external senses of sight and sound all dissolve into champagne energy. It's like having a bubble bath. It's like being massaged by the Holy Spirit. It's like the cosmic parents are holding you, embracing you, stretching you and squeezing you in loving ways that totally fulfill you. That's the heavenly side to the dissolution experience. Having said that, you might be saying, gee, I hope I get that someday. First of all, you don't have to have that kind of experience in order to gain insight and purification. Secondly, there is another side, the side that is not heavenly. The side that hopefully will be purgatorial and hopefully will not be hellish. Purgatory and hell are very different, theologically speaking. Purgatory is a temporary place where you are purified. Consciousness is purified and every minute that you spend in purgatory, although it may be uncomfortable, is a moment that takes you closer and closer to heaven, the beatific vision. Hell is a place of pointless suffering. It doesn't lead you anywhere. Purgatory definitely has a goal and there's a silver lining to the cloud, you might say. So sometimes the experience of dissolution can be purgatorial. It can seem as though you're being torn apart. You can be terrified. It can seem as though you have no firm ground to stand on. There are horrific, painful mental images, images of death and destruction. In classical shamanic cultures, this sometimes takes the form of animals eating you up. The whole thing is in some ways like being sick, the purgatorial side of dissolution. In fact, in traditional African cultures, this stage is often associated with actual physical illness from which the shaman recovers and then knows their vocation as a server of humanity. There's exactly four possibilities. Some people do the path without any dissolution. Some people do the path with the heavenly kind of dissolution. Some people do the path with the purgatorial kind of dissolution. Some people do the path, there's a mixture of the heavenly and the purgatory. My favorite poet is T.S. Eliot. He pulls no punches. Apparently for him, the Bhangra did not have much of the blissful aspect that I'm describing. As I said, it's different for different people and you have to just accept. Some people don't have dissolution experiences, some people have blissful ones, some people have horrific ones, and some people have a mixture of the two. It seems, if we just base on what Eliot had to say, that his was much more purgatorial. In part of the Four Quartets, he compares this to being sick. He compares the action of the Trinity to a surgeon, that would be the son, and to a nurse, that was the Holy Spirit, and to the owner of the hospital, which is God the Father. Remember that Eliot was a traditional high church Anglican, very conservative Christian. He thought of his job as not trying to convince people of Christianity through poetry. He didn't think that was the poet's job. The poet's job, if they're a Christian poet, is to allow people to experience what it's like to be a Christian, even if they may not be Christians. You can experience what it feels like to be a Christian, in his case a form of Catholic Christian, Church of England. You can experience what it's like to be that, even though you might not believe in that, by reading his poetry, and that's why I like his poetry, because although I wouldn't say that I buy into the belief system of that path, I really appreciate that by reading him I can experience what it's like to be somebody on that path. So I'm going to read for you a little section on how the Holy Spirit, which is the Christian term for the activity of impermanence, how the Holy Spirit acts on you in order to rip apart your somethingness, and in a sense kill you, but kill you in the sense of dissolving the somethingness of self within you so that there's nothing in between you and the beatific vision, which is their word for the direct experience of the source. The wounded surgeon plies the steel that questions the distempered part. Beneath the bleeding hands we feel the sharp compassion of the healer's art, resolving the enigma of the fever chart. Our only health is the disease if we obey the dying nurse, whose constant care is not to please, but to remind of our and Adam's curse, and that to be restored our sickness must grow worse. The whole earth is our hospital, endowed by the ruined millionaire, in which if we do well we shall die of the absolute parental care, which will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere. The chill ascends from feet to knees, the fever sings in mental wires, if to be warmed then I must freeze and quake in frigid purgatorial fires of which the flame is roses and the smoke is briars. The dripping blood our only drink, the bloody flesh our only food, in spite of which we like to think that we are sound, substantial flesh and blood. And in spite of that we call this Friday good.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.120000000000001, "text": " There's an experience that some people have in their spiritual
