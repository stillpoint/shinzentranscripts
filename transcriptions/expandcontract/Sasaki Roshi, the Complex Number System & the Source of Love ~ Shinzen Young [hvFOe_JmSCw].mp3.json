{"text": " Sasaki Roshi makes a lot more claims about his paradigm than I do. He may be right. I only claim it's a useful way to analyze how consciousness works moment by moment. He implies that it's more than that, that it's a universal grand theory of everything. You can look at everything that is in terms of a paradigm of mutually contrasting activities that can cancel into a neutral, and a neutral that can cancel into a neutral and a neutral that can polarize into mutually contrasting activities. He says this is sort of like the way everything works. It is not inconceivable that in a hundred years, two hundred years, a thousand years, whenever, finally a single unified grand theory of everything is hit upon, that it turns out to have something to do with binary contrasts that can cancel. There's some hint that that might be the case because so far our best model for everything is the complex number system, our modern concept of number. And the complex number system consists of three types of contrast, each one of which can neutralize to a non-contrasting state. There's the multiplicative domain, which is a stretch-squeeze thing. You stretch-squeeze, or nothing moves, which is one, multiplied by one. Or you can multiply by a number whose absolute value is less than one, that will squeeze things. You can multiply by a number whose absolute value is greater than one, that will stretch things. But if you multiply by one, it's a neutral element. Then you have the additive domain, where you can move to the right, move to the left, or not move at all, or front, back, top, bottom, or any direction of any vector. Well, in the complex plane it's a two-dimensional thing. In other words, move in one direction, move oppositely in that direction, they cancel out. That's additive zero. And then there's a rotational component in the complex numbers, where you can turn to the right, turn to the left, or not turn at all. T.S. Eliot talks about the spirit as the dance. Except for the point, the still point, there would be no dance. And there is only the dance. If you look at a dancer, what do they do? Like Martha Grant writes, stretch your arms out, bring your arms in, okay, this sort of stretch-squeeze, but they also move up, move down, they jump, they move to the right, they move to the left, they turn to the right, turn to the left. All the actions of the dancer are actually quantified with our modern concept of number. Also, it turns out that the quantum weirdness is in a sense a consequence of our modern kinds of numbers, the complex, what are called the complex numbers. The waves that are complex waves allow for these weird things to happen. Among them, something coming from nothing, which is rather extraordinary. The neutral state can be a source of polarized something. It is possible that he's right. Who knows? Only time will tell. But the fact that our number system seems to be built on binary contrast that can neutralize three different flavors of them, actually, the fact that he says consciousness is this contrasting, neutralizing activity, could be that this is pointing towards a grand theory of everything. The whole point in experiencing this is that it's analogous to the peristalsis of a formless womb. And as you begin to experience yourself and the world coming from this doing and returning to this doing, even though the doing is impersonal and empty, it's also a source of unconditional love. When we contact it, it has that effect on the human part of us.
