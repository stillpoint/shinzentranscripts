{"text": " How does a person's growth on the path of liberation differ from that of a person's liberation? Not true for everyone, but often a person's growth on the path of liberation will follow what is colloquially called a hockey stick curve. The proper name for this is an exponential curve, and exponential curves have the characteristic that the more you grow, the faster you grow. Snowball is an example of an exponential curve. The growth rate of the snowball is proportional to the surface area of the snowball. So the bigger the snowball gets, the faster the snowball adds snow. So the rate of growth is proportional to how much it has grown. And if you have any background in calculus or analysis, you know the math behind this. It's quite fundamental actually in those fields. So in any event, when you start your practice, if you follow this common pattern, you do grow. But it seems like you're growing linear, and there's growth there, but it's not stunning. It's sort of like, well, at this rate, it's going to really, really take a long time to get anywhere. But hopefully you persevere, and at some point, you start to notice it's really taking off. And some people call this the break point in the curve. As I say, it is by no means the case that everyone that follows a spiritual path goes through this kind of situation. But an awful lot of people do. Now of course, the natural question is, at what point does this dramatic upsurge take place? And we can't say exactly. For some people, it happens fairly early on in their practice. For other people, it might take, in the most extreme case, maybe 10 or 15 years. What happens at this point that makes the difference? Well, there can be a lot of factors. But one of them is certainly when one reaches the point where one starts to get what I call the flavor of purification. In other words, you start to actually detect, have a tangible experience that when you bring mindful awareness to an unpleasant experience, you're purifying consciousness. You can actually taste the purification happening within you. It's really hard to put into words, but it's a kind of knowing that because of the way I'm experiencing this moment, every moment of my future is going to have more fulfillment and less suffering. Another way to put it is, it's a tangible awareness that because of the way I'm experiencing this moment, I'm clearing up the stored poison and pain from all my previous moments. You actually sense that happening. Once that taste is there, you've got a positive feedback loop going. And what characterizes hockey stick growth is it's a positive feedback loop. In other words, the bigger it gets, the faster it grows. So once there's the positive feedback that bringing equanimity, concentration, clarity, but especially equanimity to a present experience, that you can actually taste it building a better future for you and cleaning out the past for you. Once that happens, now you've got a positive feedback loop, and that's one of the causes of this dramatic runaway growth. There can be other causes also. So I give people this hockey stick metaphor by way of encouragement when they're in this seeming linear phase here, and it just doesn't seem like anything. It seems like, yeah, growth is happening, but if the journey is a million miles and in the first year I go 10 miles, that doesn't bode well. But what people don't realize is that, well, maybe in the next year you'll go 100, in the next year you'll go 1,000, et cetera, et cetera. And at some point it becomes evident to you, you reach this sort of, oh my God, place right about here where you realize that little old me can feasibly hope to experience the classic results that I've read about in these ancient books.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " How does a person's growth on the path of liberation differ from that of a person's",
