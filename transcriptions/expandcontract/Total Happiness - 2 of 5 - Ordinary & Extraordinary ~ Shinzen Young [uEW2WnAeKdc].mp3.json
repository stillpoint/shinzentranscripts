{"text": " The sensory nature of thought seems to go very, very deep into the unconscious thinking. Audio-video. And as far as I can see, underneath that audio-video is subtler audio and subtler video, and underneath that is subtler subliminal audio and subtler subliminal video. And underneath that, well, who knows? An ordinary concept of happiness for the body is you get pleasant sensations in the body. And the body is happy if it can avoid unpleasant sensations. Well, the mind is happy if it can get answers to things, and the mind is happy if it can avoid confusion, if it can avoid muddle. And muddle can be very intense. The aging process can muddle our minds very severely. Strong emotions can do the same. Losing our mental capacities is not going to happen to every person, but it's certainly going to happen to some people. So not only do we start to get discomforts in the body and lose bodily abilities, but we start to get confusion in the mind as we get senile, we get older. Then if we're old and we have illness, on top of that, we can be in very confused states. Even people that were very smart, very together in the ordinary sense in their lives can end up very muddled mentally. And of course, the extreme cases are dementing diseases like Alzheimer's and so forth. It's going to happen to some of us, okay? The job of the mind is to know stuff, to get answers. And when it can't get answers, or worse still, its very ability to get answers is compromised and perhaps permanently compromised, then the mind's not very happy. So two things, gets answers, avoids the don't know and the muddle for the mind. Body is happy, gets pleasant sensations, physical, emotional, avoids unpleasant sensations, physical, emotional. So that gives us a way to think about ordinary happiness. Mindfulness, skills, increase all these dimensions of ordinary happiness. In contradiction to the pole called ordinary happiness, there's another pole that contrasts to that, which could be called extraordinary happiness. Let's start with body experience. What we think we want is to avoid unpleasant sensations, but what we really want is to avoid the perception of suffering that comes with unpleasant sensations. Perceived suffering equals intensity of discomfort in the body divided by mindfulness. As concentration, clarity and equanimity get bigger, even though the intensity of the discomfort remains the same, the perceived suffering will diminish. And if mindfulness becomes big enough, the perceived suffering due to physical or emotional discomfort in the body can be dropped to effectively zero. That's liberation from suffering of that sort. Mindfulness is directly related to a dimension of extraordinary happiness, where our concern in the extraordinary happiness domain is not get rid of uncomfortable touch or feel in the body. Our concern is get rid of uncomfortable touch and feel if it's appropriate or if you can, but when you can't or when you should be experiencing those things because they motivate and direct you, under those circumstances, experience them mindfully so that they become more poignant and less problematic, although that seems somewhat contradictory. They're experienced more deeply, but the suffering, the perceived suffering due to discomfort drops. So mindfulness pays off both ways. It allows the discomforts in the body to fulfill their function because you're having a complete experience of them. You're bringing concentration, sensory clarity and equanimity to them. That's called a complete experience. That's not called getting rid of them. Get rid of them if it's appropriate or you can, and it's appropriate, but when it's not appropriate to get rid of them or you can't, it would be appropriate but you just can't, then the mindfulness will allow you to experience that discomfort with diminished suffering and in the most extreme case, no suffering. In the dimension of extraordinary happiness, our goal is essentially not to avoid discomfort in the body but to avoid suffering in the body by having a complete experience of discomfort in the body. Likewise, in the domain of extraordinary happiness, our goal is not merely to have pleasure but to have fulfillment. Now it turns out that fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by mindfulness. Small pleasure, a lot of mindfulness, a lot of satisfaction. Bad news, big pleasure, not very much mindfulness, I can't get no satisfaction. The Imelda Marcos phenomenon. How many pairs of shoes will satisfy you if you don't know how to derive fulfillment from pleasure? 100 times 0 is still 0. 1000 times 0 is still 0. 2000, I think that's what she eventually got up to. But it couldn't deliver the goods. I can't get no satisfaction. The dimension of extraordinary happiness, our concern becomes not merely getting pleasure but deriving fulfillment and eventually enormous fulfillment from whatever pleasure is there. The preoccupation with avoiding discomfort is replaced with the noble quest for freedom from suffering. And the preoccupation with getting pleasure is replaced by the noble quest of achieving total fulfillment, which of course implies no more drivenness. But does not imply for a moment a lack of dynamic motivation. You can have conditions that are producing pain in the body and there's no pleasure in the body, still happy. Extraordinary happiness is happiness independent of conditions, external object of conditions. What it mainly depends on is your base level of mindfulness. And that's good news because we can elevate our mindfulness as far as we want. So that we can be in the realm of extraordinary happiness, there's no limit as to how happy we can be. What about the mind? In the world of extraordinary happiness, the mind's not preoccupied, not in this or that question. It is interested in the question. And extraordinary happiness comes about when the mind gets the answer to the question. And what is the question? The question is, what am I? When the mind's got an answer to that, it knows its source. I would call that salvation, to know your source directly. And I would call that wisdom. The preoccupation with this or that question is in the realm of extraordinary happiness replaced with the preoccupation with the question.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " The sensory nature of thought seems to go very, very deep into the unconscious thinking.", "tokens": [440, 27233, 3687, 295, 1194, 2544, 281, 352, 588, 11, 588, 2452, 666, 264, 18900, 1953, 13], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.37838992266587806, "compression_ratio": 1.8258064516129033, "no_speech_prob": 0.07545726746320724}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 13.92, "end": 20.92, "text": " Audio-video.
