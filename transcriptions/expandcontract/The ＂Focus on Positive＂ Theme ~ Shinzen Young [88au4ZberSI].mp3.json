{"text": " Instead of just observing the subjective system of field image talk, we've been intentionally finding, creating, holding, and even radiating what I call positive states. So sometimes in the process of just observing, it might happen to you that you get a mental picture that has a deep positive significance for you. It might happen. Native people value this very much and actually go through various physical ordeals of fasting and other ceremonies in order to get those deep sort of directional images. And anthropologists call it a vision quest, although native people just call it fasting. If an Indian says, I've been fasting, they probably mean I just spent four days without any food or any water alone on a hill crying for a vision. So it could happen as you're just in the course of practice that a particularly powerful image comes up, or you could intentionally create it. So if it comes up spontaneously, you can just note it if you're doing focus in and not treat it in any way special. Or you can decide, hey, this is significant. I'm going to try to hold it, intentionally go with it. And that becomes a focus on a positive image. Analogously, it could happen just spontaneously that a wisdom word or phrase, something that encapsulates a certain good direction, psychologically, behaviorally, or spiritually for you, something comes up in the talk space. And you might want to just observe it, or you might want to hold on to it. So then you could shift to a focus on positive. But it's also possible to intentionally create those kinds of words, phrases, and sentences if you wish. Positive feel is a special case, I would say, of feel in general. And it's feel that typically is pleasant, although you can have compassion type feels that are sort of sad but in a compassionate way, et cetera. Quite how one would classify that, I'm not sure. But usually, the positive feels are pleasant. They're associated with a positive direction in your behavior or positive aspirations for others. But I also count positive feel as pleasant sensations associated with being in highly concentrated states, pleasant sensations associated with the presence of flow, restful states, or just an intrinsic joy for no reason whatsoever. Ahe Tukananda in Sanskrit is joy that's just our birthright and doesn't have to have a reason. This would be a range of things that we could call positive feel. And they could come up, once again, spontaneously as we're just observing things. Or we can sort of look for it, create it, attempt to hold it. And when you look for it, when you decide to hold it, if it's come up spontaneously, or you intentionally look for it, create it, and then hold it, that's an approach called focus on positive. When you have things that fall under the category of positive come up spontaneously, then you sort of have a choice of whether to deal with the matter of factly, whether to go for a focus on positive, which is sort of a formal structure where you hold, repeat, and so forth, or whether to go into just discursive thinking. And like, okay, I'm going to explore this and think about this in the normal way that I think about things, because this seems like nature is opening an insight door or some window, and I would like to pursue it discursively. So essentially, if something unusually positive comes up visually, auditorially, or somatically in the subjective domain as you're practicing, I would say you have three choices. And sorry to give you so many choices, but they're all good. The basic thing about not being freaked out by choices is to realize all the choices are good. You're not going to miss out no matter which one you take. So one choice is you're just going to deconstruct it. There's a famous story about the Zen monk is meditating, and the gods are so impressed by his practice that they come and give flowers every day. This goes on for a couple weeks, and finally, one day, he just takes out the kesaku and beats the crap out of all the gods and says, get the hell out of here. Well, it's a metaphor for being matter of fact no matter what comes up, even if the gods give you flowers and bathe you and whatever, seemingly, that's just field image talk. So even if very impactful things come up, you might decide to simply, that's just field image talk. That's one decision, and then you would be penetrating them, but in the same way that you would penetrate any sensory event. Alternatively, okay, let's go to hold positive. It's a formal technique. I'm going to repeat that talk as a mantra. I'm going to try to maintain that image. I'm going to try to maintain that field or some combination of those three, a pair or all three at once. So then you go to focus on positive. Third possibility, oh, nature seems to be presenting me with an insight window here. I need to think about this, and you start thinking. Notice that I go nowhere without a notepad. When insights come, I will often go into discursive thought, and I will write things down, et cetera, et cetera. Now, I know I'm suspending the formal practice in order to think in the normal way because I have to think in the normal way to pursue that insight, and it's certainly okay to do that on occasion. What we want to avoid is a meditation that is only discursive thought because that's not really meditation, but it's certainly okay to do that when it seems appropriate.", "segments": [{"id": 0,
