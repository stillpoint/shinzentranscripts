{"text": " The sources of shifting in visual experience are several. Obviously if you turn your head, you turn your body, that causes huge shiftings and that's a source of shift. Then you have what might be called the large scale movements of the eyes, like sight, sight, sight, sight. But then there's like sight, but then I could be aware of shift, shift, shift, like smaller movements from place to place within the object. Each one of those is a sight too and probably those small shifts are some combination of saccadic movements, which are physical, plus movements in the visual cortex where in the brain the center of attention is shifting around, even though there's not a physical basis for it. And any of the shifts from the gross movements of the body to the shifts that actually are not based on the physical but are based on what the nervous system is doing centrally, any of those scales of shift represents a new instance of visual experience. And in fact that's the whole trick in getting the flow in sight space, is to detect each large and small scale shift. And just like the body, as you become aware of how the attention shifts around, starts to become undulatory and soft, the external visual experience goes through a similar change as you're sort of with each shift like that. I encourage people, maybe you can guess what I'm going to say now, both, right? Do it with the glasses on so that you get the normal 20-20-20, but also the glasses off, well that's just a little bit like Yaza or something, it's artificial but it could be a platform to learn some stuff. I myself now am in total pixelated flow.
