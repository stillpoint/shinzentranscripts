{"text": " The first level of untangling was to sort of separate out the strands. So first you separate out the field of your stock.

So you untangle, that gives you insight into no self. Sometimes noting ordinary can be sort of harsh and uncomfortable. You can always go to the restful states and note them and you can have the same sequence of insights and purifications in a little more pleasant modality. But then there is a deeper level of untangling where you see that the strands themselves are all just made of vibrating energy. They're like vibrating super strings. Field image stock is all made of vibrations, etc., etc. That's the focus on flow technique that I gave you. That was called insight into impermanence. And then you look a little more deeply. They're vibrations that they sort of vibrate and then they disappear, vibrate and disappear.
