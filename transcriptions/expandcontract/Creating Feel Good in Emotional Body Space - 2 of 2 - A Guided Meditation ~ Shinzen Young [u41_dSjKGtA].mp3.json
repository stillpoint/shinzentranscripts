{"text": " Let's explore it. So once again, take a moment to stretch up and settle in. And now this time, we're going to actively create positive feel, if possible. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We'll just see. So I'd like you to think some thought that's likely to produce a pleasant feel in your body, and then focus in on that. And it will either continue to resonate or it will dampen and die away. If that happens, rethink either the same thought or a different one. And then drop the thought and focus on the pleasant resonance in the body for as long or as short as it may last. Does that make sense? Yeah. Now one thing that can help this is to intentionally smile just a little bit, like the Buddha smile, a little hint of a smile. Notice how that produces a pleasant feel. And that can fortify the process. Better? to do that to a certain extent? Excellent. But stay with it for a few more minutes. Laughter counts as positive feeling. Let it spread as broadly as you can. That might go out of your body. As you do this, try to actually taste how it develops a concentrated state. You're very focused. You're in samadhi. You're in the zone. And your object of focus is this pleasant experience. And the more concentrated you become, the more pleasant it becomes, motivating you to become even more one-pointed with this pleasant flavor. That creates a positive feedback loop that revs up your concentration power. Does that make sense as a concept? Excellent. Now, stay with that concentration in your pleasant emotional body. But open your eyes. Eyes open, but awareness back into the positive feel. Good. And now we'll make eye contact. Let's see if you can just keep some awareness during the social interaction. Takes a little bit of practice. So, any final questions or comments? Well, I think this was an excellent session. There's actually a lot more to say about the technique, but you can read about that at basicmindfulness.org. Look, there's a reference guide to all the different aspects. I just taught you some parts of it, but clearly you have enough to implement it, and that's excellent. Thanks for helping out to make this video. Thank you.
