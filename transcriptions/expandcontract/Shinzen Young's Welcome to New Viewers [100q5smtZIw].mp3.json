{"text": " My name is Shinzen Young, and I would like to welcome you to my YouTube channel. Literally welcome. It is well that you have come. If you're watching this, you probably have some interest in what might be described as the spiritual path. It is good when a person comes to the place in their life where they are considering taking on the practices of the spiritual path. Obviously, there are many approaches from which this can be done. At this YouTube channel, you'll hear me describe one of those approaches. It's an approach based on what's called mindfulness, and it takes as its model that the spiritual path is a kind of cultivation of a skill set. It's exercises, in a sense, that will allow you eventually to both see beyond the self and the world and to, in an optimal way, improve yourself and improve the world. I would say that those are the two basic themes of a deep spiritual path. See beyond yourself and the world, in a sense, get over the self and the world, and at the same time, improve the self and the world, and see those as complementary endeavors. When you can see those as complementary endeavors, I would say that you have reached spiritual maturity. Mindfulness, as I like to define it, is a threefold attentional skill set involving the gradual development in a natural way of concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity. It turns out that when you develop this skill set, which, by the way, anyone can develop with time, practice, and competent instruction, when you develop this skill set to a certain critical degree, which, once again, anyone can do, given enough time, ordinary experience becomes utterly extraordinary. It becomes spiritualized. In the Christian tradition, this is sometimes referred to as the practice of the presence of God, meaning that you don't have to go to church anymore because you can't get away from church. Every place you look is a beatific vision. Every sound of the world is a sacred hymn. Every ordinary sensation in your body is the massage of the Spirit. So that's ordinary experience experienced with an extraordinary awareness. That's the essence of the mindfulness approach. Within mindfulness, there are a number of different traditions, different ways of developing that skill set. What you'll learn from me is eclectic. I've drawn from a couple of the Burmese traditions, but I've also been influenced by something that is historically not part of mindfulness, which is Zen and also Vajrayana. I've taken the influences from those. Vajrayana, if you're not familiar, is a practice primarily associated with Tibet. I've taken from those traditions, but sort of woven them within the framework of the mindfulness way of working. Why I like to use the mindfulness framework is for several reasons. First of all, it's possible to present a really deep and complete spiritual path within the framework of mindfulness without there being any specific religious doctrines involved. You can just extract it from the background. Historically, the background is Buddhism. There is certainly a thing called the Buddhist religion, but you can extract the mindfulness practice from that thing called the Buddhist religion and make something that is acceptable to anyone. I don't know if you can hear in the background, but they're chanting mass where I am right now. We're at the Carmelite Spiritual Center in Niagara Falls, Canada. I'm running a mindfulness retreat. Why is it that these Catholic priests welcome us? Well, they realize that we're teaching something that is certainly compatible with their Christian contemplative practices. The Carmelites are a meditating or contemplative order. They know that we're not trying to convert people to Buddhism, even though our technique is derived historically from Buddhism. We're not trying to convince people to believe in reincarnation or to worship icons of the Buddha or something like that. We've extracted the essence of the practice, the concentration, clarity, and equanimity skill cultivation. We've extracted it from the doctrines. I like to say we give people hardware and we'll let you run your own software, your own philosophy, which could be Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, or radical, secular Marxism. It could be whatever you want. We give you the hardware. You run your own software. I find that the mindfulness framework makes it very easy to do that. Also, the mindfulness framework allows us to discard the cultural aspects that are associated with Asia. I just came back from Israel, where I ran a retreat that was... I had 90 Israeli people there. They were all Jewish. There's actually a law in Orthodox Judaism, and some of those people were Orthodox, that you're not allowed to have any statues, any idols in the land of Israel. Well, that's not a problem. That's just a cultural piece of baggage from Asia. It's not central to what we do. You don't have to chant in Sino-Japanese or eat with chopsticks in order to attain enlightenment. So, the mindfulness framework allows us to extract the essence from the cultural background. The other thing that I like about the mindfulness framework is that it is very harmonious with science. In fact, it's basically like science. The nuts and bolts of science is to track how much of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates. Those of you that have a background in science, technology, or engineering know what I'm talking about. It's the nuts and bolts of science. Well, it turns out that the nuts and bolts of mindfulness is essentially identical, except applied to sensory experience. It's how much of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates, with regards to your experience of self and world. So, the mindfulness perspective fits very well with modern science, and it is amenable to study through the methods of neuroscience. Because we can extract from the doctrinal background, we can extract from the cultural baggage, and we have something that is not only compatible with, but actually potentiates the scientific point of view. For those reasons, I like the mindfulness perspective on the spiritual path. So, at this channel, that's the perspective that you'll be getting. And I hope that you'll find it useful and can apply it to the nitty-gritty of your inner life and your external behaviors.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.64, "text": " My name is Shinzen Young, and I would like to welcome you to my YouTube channel.
