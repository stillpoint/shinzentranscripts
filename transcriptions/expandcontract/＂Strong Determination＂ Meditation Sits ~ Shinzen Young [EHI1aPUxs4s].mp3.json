{"text": " Strong determination sit is an English translation of a Pali expression aditana. That means that you make a determination or an intention that for a certain period of time you're going to sit without moving voluntarily. It could be an hour, it could be two hours, three hours, four hours, or longer. And in general, there is the issue of sitting for long periods of time, whether you make a vow not to intentionally move or not. I encourage people, as a general principle, at least occasionally, to do long sits and or strong determination sits. I think it's a very good way to push the envelope of practice. There are some parameters, of course, some basic principles you have to keep in mind. The first and obvious one, but still needs to be mentioned, is I would never encourage anybody to sit to the extent that it causes any harm to the body. Usually for the average person, you would have to sit quite a long time to cause harm to the body in terms of joints or paresthesia of nerves or that kind of thing. I mean abiding paresthesia from having damaged nerves. I don't think that's likely to happen for the average person in just an hour or two hours of strong determination sit. But a person does need to be careful that no physical damage arises due to the practice. And how you do that is basically you start experimenting, and if you do something that causes you to be limping for a half hour after you get up, well, that's a sign that you don't want to be doing that kind of thing. We want to just deal with the sensations, the sensory challenge that's involved in the long sits. So what's the sensory challenge involved in strong determination sit or long sit? Well, clearly it brings up physical discomfort, and that physical discomfort then brings up mental and emotional reactions. So the mental reactions come through mental images and internal talk. The emotional reaction comes from the emotional type sensation in the body, which many of you know I call feel, body sensation that seems to a given individual at a given time to be emotional in nature. And then the more physical type sensations, the pain, the fatigue, and so forth, the sleepiness, possible nausea, those sensations I call touch in contrast to the feel. So basically the longer you sit, the greater the intensity of sensory challenge that arises. Mental discomforts become more intense, your feel-image-talk reactions to them become more intense. So at some point you have a touch-feel-image-talk storm going on in yourself. Now to the extent that you can bring concentration, clarity, and equanimity to that, to that extent it's going to turn into a flavor of empowerment and purification. On the other hand, by forcing yourself to sit long or sit without moving, it may drive you into a state of concentration, clarity, and equanimity. So one use for the longer sits or the strong determination sits is it will force you or literally drive you into new levels of mindfulness that can be extremely useful because that then becomes the new set point for your practice. So sometimes people will tell me, well, I've reached a certain plateau with my practice. What can I do in order to push the envelope to move on to the next level, and so forth? Well actually there's a bunch of things a person can do, but one of the simplest things they can do is start doing at least occasionally, not necessarily every time, but at least occasionally doing longer sits, strong determination sits, dealing with that challenge pushes you forward. I said that there's some guidelines. One of the guidelines is, well, don't damage the body with this. Another guideline is don't get goal-driven in terms of thinking that the issue is how much can I take for how long. That's not the issue in this kind of sitting. The issue is how much can I learn and retrain the nervous system. That's sort of your goal. The goal is not like, okay, I've got to make it to four hours without moving kind of thing. The goal is, okay, how much mileage retraining of my processing of touch, feel, image, talk can I get from what I'm doing? The guidelines are don't damage the body. And yes, there is a goal, but the goal is not to achieve certain personal records in terms of duration of sit or intensity of what you sat through. The goal is, well, how effectively am I learning? There's something to be gained by bearing down. There's something to be gained by easing up. The main advantage to this is, as I say, that it will tend to push the envelope of your practice in a natural way because the natural response to intense physical discomfort is actually to drop into equanimity. But in order to access that natural response, you may have to push the envelope a little bit. For certain people, this is actually a very easy way. Well, no, I won't say a very easy way. It's a relatively easy way to make a lot of progress, a lot of tangible progress. So if you find that you're one of those people, I would encourage you to explore this within the parameters that I mentioned. Remember that if you've got 10 units of physical discomfort, 10 units of emotional discomfort, 10 units of disconcerting imagery, and 10 units of negative talk, if you can keep that all separate, you'll have 10 plus 10 plus 10 plus 10, which is 40. If they get tangled, you're going to get the impression of 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, which is 10,000. Put alternatively, a level of perceived suffering that the average person would say is 10,000 and utterly unbearable, it's fainting, it's kill-me-now level for the average person. For someone with mindfulness skills, it's not 10,000, it's 40, and that's quite doable. So if you bear that in mind and explore in that direction, then this can be a very meaningful practice for you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.120000000000001, "text": "
