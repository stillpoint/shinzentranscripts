{"text": " This was way back at the end of the Vietnam War. I was living in a Vietnamese Buddhist temple, but not in Vietnam. It was a Vietnamese ethnic temple in Los Angeles. You may remember the news footage of the people clinging onto the helicopters in Saigon, trying to get out and whatever. What happened was that there was this huge influx of Vietnamese refugees. They were sent to marine camps, dedicated marine camps throughout the United States. One of the big places they were sent was Camp Pendleton, which is near San Diego in Southern California. The temple where I was living, the International Buddhist Meditation Center, was in L.A. It was really interesting to see the marines in action. They realized that at least half of the people that were coming into that camp would be Buddhist. The other half would be Catholic, because that's sort of the religious breakdown in the country. They could handle the Catholic, because that's international. You just get Catholic priests. But they were smart enough to know that there were Buddhists, Buddhist clergy in the United States. They were smart enough to, in fact, know that there were Americans that had been trained in the Vietnamese stuff. The U.S. Marines contracted with the temple, our temple, to hire a Buddhist clergy that would be there when those refugees arrived. They went out and they bought Buddha statues. They had these tents set up. It was there for these people that the night before had been hanging from the helicopters. They were that organized. That was actually quite impressive. What happened was that a whole bunch of us went down the morning after the thing of the people on the helicopters. We went down on a bus to Camp Pendleton. We could see people coming in buses. The people we'd seen on the news the night before hanging from the helicopters were being bused into this. It was amazing to see the look on their face when they saw Americans of all races in Vietnamese Buddhist robes and able to chant and do the liturgy in Vietnamese. There's this expression, to meet the Buddha in hell. For them it's hell. It's the last thing in the world they would ever expect going to the United States on a military camp. The first thing they're going to see is native-born Americans that are capable of working within their tradition as Buddhist chaplains. The reason I thought about this was there were among those refugees a certain number of Buddhist monks, as you might imagine. They would want to get out of the country if it was going to go communist. I noticed that among all the Buddhist monks there, there was one that was young, but no matter where you would see him, he would always be surrounded by people. He was like a people magnet. His English was pretty limited, but through a combination of his limited English and writing in Chinese characters, because I can write Chinese and the monks in Vietnam learn how to write classical Chinese. Through the limited English and us writing back and forth with Chinese characters, I was able to talk to him. His name was Thich Dung Nguyen. I said, it's like, what's the deal? People seem to relate to you very differently from any of the other Buddhist clergy that's here. They said, well, my teacher taught me loving-kindness practice from the very get-go. Loving-kindness is a traditional version of the focus on positive feel. From the time he was just a little kid, he was trained to radiate this out. You could see the objective impact it had on the people around him. Anyway, at an advanced level, it's not just going to be in your body. It's going to go out of the body in all six directions. It would be just like a high-wattage broadcast of human positivity. Sound like a plan?
