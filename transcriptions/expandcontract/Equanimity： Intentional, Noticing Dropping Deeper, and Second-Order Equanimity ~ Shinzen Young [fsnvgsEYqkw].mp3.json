{"text": " How can we bring equanimity to an experience? You can intentionally bring equanimity to it. There are ways of doing that. However, I would say that in the end, the most significant learning about equanimity comes about by what you described initially, which is it just sort of happens to you and you notice it, and you notice its effect. How can you bring equanimity to an experience? Well, you can try to physically relax the body. That tends to open the body, and that tends to open consciousness. So if you can keep the body physically relaxed as various sensory phenomena are arising, that's something that you can intentionally do that would tend to create equanimity. You can attempt to intentionally create talk that sort of welcomes whatever is coming up, or you can attempt to sort of disregard talk that judges, or a sort of combined strategy, you replace judging talk with accepting talk, because we have a certain control over internal talk. So you can use your control over talk and your control over the relaxation of the body to create equanimity to a certain extent. But there's only a limited extent to which a person can do that. And mostly you just wait for it to happen. You drop into it. It's a numbers game. And then when you drop into it, you notice it's happened, and you notice the effect of it on your sense of happiness, and that creates a positive conditioning loop. It's important to also understand that if you can't have equanimity, meaning you can't control the tensing in your body and the judging in your mind, then have equanimity with the non-equanimity. Go to that and just observe and accept the tension and observe and accept the judgments. So that either you have equanimity or you have equanimity with your lack of equanimity, which is a second-order equanimity, would be my recommendations.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.0, "text": " How can we bring equanimity to an experience?", "tokens": [1012, 393, 321, 1565, 1267, 17869, 507, 281, 364, 1752, 30], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2502453736584596, "compression_ratio": 1.819905213270142, "no_speech_prob": 0.03301173076033592}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 6.0, "end": 11.0, "text": " You can intentionally bring equanimity to it.
