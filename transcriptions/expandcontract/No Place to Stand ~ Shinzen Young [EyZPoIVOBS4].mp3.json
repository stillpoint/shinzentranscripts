{"text": " Okay, we use metaphors for this practice. We meaning all the mindfulness teachers in the world. And those metaphors are metaphors and if they help you, good, and if they get in the way, not good. One of the metaphors for equanimity is, and it's a standard one and it's used by very famous and deep teachers, you sit on the bank of the river and watch it. But that is just a metaphor for equanimity. That's not what equanimity is, okay. One of the things about the way I teach that people often find weird is I don't actually give you a whole base to go back to. A lot of people give you the breath, say okay, keep coming back to the breath. Why doesn't Shinzen do that? Well, not against it. It's a totally valid way to practice. But there is a reason why I don't give you a place to stand. And I quote no less an authority than one of the great enlightened masters of China, Lin Ji, who says, inside of every human being, there is an authentic person that has no position. The authentic human with no position. If I were to characterize the experience of Zen practice at Mount Baldy, I would say it is de-centering. You've heard of centering prayer? That's de-centering prayer. Gives you no place to stand. It's very disorienting. When you finally give up the notion that you're going to have a place to stand, that's when that figure ground reversal takes place. That's when you're doing three-dimensional Zen, as opposed to flat Zen, which would be the Zen put down of the way Vipassana is often done, from a fixed perspective. I'm over here sitting on the riverbank, watching the river. Well, if that works right, at some point you will become the river without being caught in the river, if it works right. But if it doesn't work right, you're going to spend 20 or 30 years on the bank of that river and never be liberated. So I don't want you to have a place to stand. I don't want you to have a center. I want the center to have you. It's a completely different experience. It's intentional. So it is hugely not a problem if you cannot find a place to stand while you do Vipassana. It's like hugely not a problem. It will be a problem if you don't have some modicum of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, though. But that's why I asked you the question about the spoken labels. Once I determined that you were doing something, then I could say with confidence, absolutely do not try to find a place to stand in general, ever. And just let the place. I don't know if you know, but the very common word in ordinary Israeli Hebrew for God is hamakom. That means the place. The place. Let the place find you, rather than you find a place.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.6, "text": " Okay, we use metaphors for this practice.
