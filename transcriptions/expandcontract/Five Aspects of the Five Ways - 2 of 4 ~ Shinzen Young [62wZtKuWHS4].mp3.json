{"text": " Each one of the five ways goes back to at least one, if not many, historical traditions that were developed around the world, and not exclusively in the East from Buddhism, but they also link to traditions from other parts of the world, the West, Christianity and so forth. Because as I say, I tend to see the worldwide contemplative tradition as a unity. You could look back from the five ways and you could see the whole history of the development of contemplation from its shamanic origins through the arising of civilizations and through the seminal discoveries of the Buddha particularly, and then the Mahayana sort of merging with Zen and what came out of that, and then the Vajrayana, and then the sort of more non-dual approaches. All of that is behind it. And I could go into a long talk and have elsewhere as to the rich historical origins of each of the five ways. They have a past, but they also have, I believe, a future because they represent reworkings of those traditions. I don't claim that these are those traditions. I am attempting to make, represent a secular modern approach to these things. The spiritual clout I don't want to lose, the liberating clout that each one of them can lead to classical enlightenment, can lead to what I believe is the core spiritual experience of humanity. Certainly don't want to lose that. Cultural trappings, doctrinal trappings, things that are based on mythology or things that don't seem to have an empirical basis or don't seem probable logically, I have tried to take that out, for better or worse. It's an approach that will work for certain people and not work for other people, like all approaches. Every approach has strengths and weaknesses, and that's good because different things work for different people. This is one direction that a person could take if they wanted to explore what can be done creatively with what has come down to us from the past. Just one possible way to go. If you look carefully at the five way system, you'll notice it's all built on binary contrasts. Binary means one-on-one, one-on-one contrast, like black versus white, that's a binary contrast. That's intentional because when you study, when you do functional imaging of brain changes as the result of whatever, meditation or anything else, you can't actually image the brain function. You can just have two contrasting conditions and compare them. I designed the system to work that way. There's a contrast between tracking ordinary sensory activity and tracking corresponding restful states. There's a contrast between intentionally creating positive feel-image talk and just observing any and all feel-image talk. There's a contrast between working with the subjective somatic visual and auditory experience versus objective somatic visual and auditory experience. There's a contrast between relative rest, where you're focusing on restful qualities, and absolute rest, where you do nothing, etc., etc., etc. Any one of those presents itself as a natural thing that can be studied with the imaging technology. When I say that the five ways have a future, hopefully, by that I mean they've been set up based on what I know that scientists need when they do this kind of research so that their effects can be easily researched in subsequent generations.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.080000000000002, "text": " Each one of the five ways goes back to at least one, if not many,
