{"text": " Oh, I think it would definitely heal the world. If we take, if by that we mean stream entry and we mean millions and millions of people having that experience. I don't have a scintilla of doubt. Well you have to look at the big picture. You have to look at all the people that were ever enlightened as they have been in the world and then you have to compare that to as they would have been if they hadn't been enlightened. And you have to take all the people because most enlightened people are not public figures. And there may be indeed a certain push to the ones that do become public figures that also is related to whatever. So I didn't say it would heal the world right away either. Because remember, I use classical enlightenment as a rough equivalent to stream entry. So that's the first out of four steps. And usually about 20 years after stream entry you realize how unenlightened you really are and that the work is now just starting. But you're guaranteed success essentially. So after a few hundred years of millions and millions of stream enterers, I think that the course of this planet would pretty much take care of itself. Now of course, I mean if you want to think really ambitious, maybe if we had a really deep model of enlightenment we'd be able to figure out how to churn out our hots with consistency. That's only maybe five times as ambitious as turning out stream entries. Who knows? Now if you start having millions and millions of our hots on the planet, it's very quick. So yeah, plenty of people that have seen the no-self screw up, but then you have to look upon it from the big picture. How badly would they have screwed up if they hadn't done that? Well I can think of maybe that I know personally of maybe a dozen people that have seen the no-self, were authentically enlightened at least to the stream entry level, and had major public screw ups. Maybe a dozen, okay? But there's probably a hundred times that many enlightened people on the planet. That's one percent that we know about. But even those screw ups are, I can only think of a couple that I would say are really horrible relative to the normal human screw ups. When the teachers screw up, by and large it's just normal human screw ups. People have sexual harassment bosses. So it's sort of like things people do, right? I can only offhand right now maybe think of one or two that I would say were really bad.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.48, "text": " Oh, I think it would definitely heal
