{"text": " I'm going to do a little bit of a demonstration of that. That came to represent for me a tangible experience of not just an integration of my thoughts and emotions, but the integration of my whole body, mind, self. So I still don't like discomfort, okay? But I know now that whenever I have to face discomfort, it will lead eventually to this same experience. I've come to expect that to happen on a regular basis, eventually. And the experience is that the entire body, mind becomes unified. And it's a really delicious experience. Anyway, that's oneness at an even larger scale. So we can have the oneness of the thoughts and emotions, but we can also have the oneness of thoughts and emotions, and the emotionality and the physicality of the body. So most people would define themselves as a body-mind entity. When you get body-mind unified as flow, then that's an integration of yourself. But how about the outside world? How about the world of sights and sounds? What I just described was a kind of other, the touch, and my feel-image-talk, which is sort of the perceiver, the it of the touch and the me of the fit, the feel-image-talk, becoming a single flow, united. When you have a complete experience of sight, external seeing, and at the same time you have a complete experience of your thoughts and emotions about what you see, then the exact same thing happens. Your eye never fixates on the external side of the flower, for example, here. So the flower is a flow of light, of colored light, and the eye looking at the flower is a flow of feel-image-talk colorations, you might say. And those two flow together, and that gives a unification of inside and outside along this dimension. And even easier for most people is with sound. That's probably why people like music so much, because whether they know it or not, they can have an experience of merging or oneness with the music. But if you understand the sensory components and how allowing your thoughts and reactions to the music to arise without any interference, so they just flow, they're suffused with concentration, clarity, and equanimity, so they become simply a flow of energy. And the music itself is relatively easy for people to experience that as a flow of energy. The hard part is to experience the listener as a flow of energy. What I found interesting when I asked people about their experiences of music, people that weren't meditators, right? Lots of people talked about the music gives them a kind of energy. And that means that although they don't quite have the categories clear and they don't quite realize the potential, when they're having that kind of, quote, energy with the music, the music is beginning to cease being a thing and it's starting to become a flow, a doing. But that's the easy part. The hard part is you're going to have thoughts and emotions that react to that music. To experience them with so much concentration, clarity, that they flow. And the music is also flowing, so the music and the listener literally become a single, integrated arabesque of empty energy. And if you can do it with music, you can do it with ordinary sounds. And if you can do it with ordinary sounds, you can do it with annoying sounds like somebody breathing in the meditation hall when they're not supposed to, or your neighbor's blasting the stereo, or you have to room with somebody that's snoring, et cetera, et cetera. So you have these various rageful reactions to the sonic invasion. Well, that's feel-image-talk. And then there's the flow of the sound. It turns out that impermanence, flow, change is the great integrator. It integrates the head and the heart. It integrates the mind and the body. It integrates the inside and the outside. It's a vacuous integration, though. It's a one and a zero at the same time. In addition to integrating the head and the heart, the mind and the body, the inside and the outside, there's an even more awesome level of integration. We could say that broadly, touch, sight, sound is it, and feel-image-talk is me, broadly. So self and world can be integrated. But there's one more contrast, deeper than the contrast between I and it, is the contrast between both of us and the formless source. In other words, between creation and creator, if we want to use a somewhat Western paradigm. When that connection becomes integrated, when there is one with the zero, the ultimate zero, that's the ultimate integration. That's the experience of living nirvana.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 15.72, "text": " I'm going to do a little bit of a demonstration of that.", "tokens": [286, 478, 516,
