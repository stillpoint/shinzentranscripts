---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=0)   My ears are asymmetrical, there's just no way around it. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=15)   Get him to tell you that story. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=17)   You know how my ears got asymmetrical? I'm not sure there's any deep dharma to it. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=24)   I was in a car accident a long, long time ago. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=30)   We flipped over in a little sports car. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=35)   I was a passenger, we got sucked under a truck. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=40)   It can actually happen, it's like a triumph. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=43)   It's a very, very light car. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=45)   We were going from San Francisco to LA. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=50)   There's no dharma in this story, okay? 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=55)   Is there any dharma in this story? 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=58)   Can I make it into it? 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=59)   You can make it into it. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=63)   No, there's no dharma. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=68)   This was before I was into meditation. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=71)   It was like way, way back in the crazy days. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=76)   Me and my friend were driving back from San Francisco to LA. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=83)   He just bought this car. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=90)   I didn't want to use the safety belt. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=96)   It may have been back when it still wasn't mandatory. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=102)   He says, no, there's no way that we're going to drive without having that seat belt on. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=108)   So I put it on. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=111)   He was in a normal state of consciousness. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=114)   I had decided to be in an altered state. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=121)   Highly altered. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=123)   It was back in the day. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=124)   We were living in Haight-Ashbury, so you get the general idea here. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=128)   What did you take? 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=129)   Huh? 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=130)   What did you take? 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=131)   Wow. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=132)   Wow. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=133)   I haven't heard this one. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=136)   There's no dharma in this story. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=140)   It's just like a weird story. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=142)   I can't put a spin on it to be of any value to you. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=146)   It's just, God, he did crazy shit. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=152)   So, yeah, it's like a couple hours down from San Francisco. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=157)   We just got sucked under a truck and then skidded out and fishtailed and then flipped over and over again and landed upside down. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=169)   And of course, the only reason I'm still here is that I have the safety because otherwise I would have just been out. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=176)   So, yeah, I'm just sort of tripping out. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=182)   I see you're liking this story. It's not going anywhere. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=187)   You can find a little dharma. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=189)   Yeah, it's like things are getting, you know, the electrical poles were like becoming little sci-fi movies. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=200)   And then there's sort of like this rumble. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=203)   And then the next thing, it was just nothing. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=205)   It was like I have complete retroactive amnesia. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=212)   I was just, there was this rumble and the next thing I'm looking up at a highway patrolman. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=218)   And he's like, you're right on. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=220)   And my friend comes over and he's all bloody and everything. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=225)   And he said, we had an accident. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=228)   And I think I said, am I OK? 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=245)   And then I passed out. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=249)   And then the next thing, I'm like in an ER. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=253)   And this doctor is looking down at me and he says, your ear has been torn off, but don't worry, we can sew it back on. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=270)   But mind you, the LSD trip is still happening. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=274)   It did not stop. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=278)   I don't want you to turn into a bad trip. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=281)   It never did. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=283)   It was never a bad trip. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=286)   I said, oh, great, OK. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=294)   But I wasn't a meditator. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=296)   I just got lucky, I guess. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=299)   I didn't freak out. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=305)   And then apparently my friend, the guy that was driving, who eventually became an MD himself, actually, 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=312)   but he told me that we lucked out because the guy was a really good surgeon. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=317)   And you can't tell that, you know, it's like you couldn't quite tell which one it was, but you could still see the scar here. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=327)   So there were some funny parts, like my friend came up, he spoke Japanese. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=339)   He was American. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=341)   I mean, he was non-Asian, but we'd been in Japan together. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=345)   So he says to me in Japanese, don't worry that the doctor's looking right in your eyes, 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=351)   because with head trauma your eyes dilate anyway. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=358)   They're not going to know. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=362)   So he's sneaking me this secret message in Japanese in front of the doctor. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=369)   So I said, OK, good. 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=373)   And it was actually something pretty funny. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=377)   So I had to be in the hospital, but then they let me out the next day. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=382)   I really lucked out because it freaking totaled the car. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=386)   I completely destroyed the car and neither of us sustained any significant injury. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=391)   And my friend had the presence of mind to bury all the drugs by the roadside. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=398)   Despite the fact that he thought he had killed me. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=407)   I was just hanging there, unconscious, because the car was upside down. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=413)   Not a serene scene, apparently. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=419)   I have blessedly no memory of this at all. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=425)   So they keep you in the hospital, and I'm just laying there at night, and I'm just peaking. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=436)   I'm looking at the ceiling, and it's like flowers are blooming. 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=443)   Well, there's the Dharma, OK, expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=447)   It was very evident. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=451)   I couldn't get to sleep, right? 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=457)   So I called the nurse, and I can't get to sleep. 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=463)   Just give me something to help me get to sleep. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=467)   She says, oh, no, in cases of head trauma like this, we never want you to be on any drugs. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=474)   I said, OK, OK, let's watch the movie for a few more hours. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=488)   Actually, I fell asleep. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=491)   That's how I got asymmetrical ears. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=496)   But actually, I can work Dharma into this in a very minor way, which is after that, I started to have something. 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=510)   There was no untoward consequences of this, apparently, other than my parents pretty much freaked out when I called them. 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=520)   But it was OK. 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=523)   At the clinical EEG, they checked out everything. 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=527)   But I did start to have something happen that has subsequently happened from that time on, which is, and it was probably a consequence of this. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=546)   I don't know, but there's something called sleep paralysis. 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=550)   You probably experienced it where you really think you're awake, and you can't move. 
<br>[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=560)   And then all sorts of, sometimes some very weird stuff happens. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=567)   Some people get Kundalini rising. 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=571)   They call it the exploding head syndrome. 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=575)   I've had that happen many times during the sleep paralysis. 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=581)   It's like someone sheared off a fire hydrant, if you've ever seen what that looks like, except it's going up your spine and blasting out of the top of your head. 
<br>[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=594)   So I started to have occasionally those kinds of experiences. 
<br>[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=598)   But the really weird things were I would have experiences where I thought I was awake and things had happened in the real world. 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=613)   I mean, I absolutely was convinced they had happened. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=618)   But then when I checked reality with all people, they hadn't happened. 
<br>[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=625)   So I was having dreams that were so vivid that they completely fooled me. 
<br>[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=633)   And that was a little bit weird. 
<br>[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=637)   And then, so some of you, if you've ever had this sleep paralysis, then you know what I'm talking about. 
<br>[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=645)   Now, what's happened over the years is I eventually did start to meditate, but the sleep paralysis thing still happens. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=653)   But it's completely different because now I'm lucid. 
<br>[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=657)   I know it's happening and I know I'm a meditator. 
<br>[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=661)   And so I can play with it. 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=663)   And I don't play with it. 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=665)   I just meditate in it and sort of explore it as an altered state. 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=672)   But in addition to the exploding head syndrome and the dreaming that is so vivid, that really sort of alters your sense of what might be reality. 
<br>[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=686)   Like, let's just imagine if in 10 seconds you suddenly find yourself in bed and someone's waking you up saying you had a dream you were at a meditation retreat. 
<br>[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=704)   Just imagine how jarring that would be. 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=710)   So that happened a lot of times. 
<br>[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=714)   And that was sort of interesting because once again, I hadn't meditated yet, so I didn't have a context for this kind of thing. 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=722)   But it really does make you think, like, maybe this is just one really big dream. 
<br>[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=730)   So anyway, that's... 
<br>[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=735)   And the other cool thing is I completely understand alien abductions. 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=742)   I have been abducted by aliens. 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=745)   It's happened several times. 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=749)   And it's a classic. 
<br>[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=752)   I mean, the whole classic thing, they're gibbering in some extraterrestrial language. 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=760)   And yes, it's true. 
<br>[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=764)   It's true. 
<br>[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=770)   I've experienced it myself several times. 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=774)   They do probes. 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=783)   Yes, I can confirm. 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=786)   And it is what they say. 
<br>[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=788)   It's that place that gets probed. 
<br>[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=795)   The one little difference is, you think I'm making this up? 
<br>[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=801)   It's happened any number of times. 
<br>[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=805)   But the one difference is I know it's happening in sleep paralysis. 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=811)   I don't think. 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=815)   But it's very, very vivid. 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=817)   It's actually the origin, this sleep paralysis and then weird shit happening with you being, like, violated, 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=827)   or in some way, like, being touched in a way you don't want to be touched, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=835)   That is the origin of the word nightmare. 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=838)   Originally, well, night is night. 
<br>[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=843)   What the hell is a mare? 
<br>[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=845)   It's not a female equine species. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=850)   A mare is a demon, and it may even be cognate to the Sanskrit word mara. 
<br>[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=858)   I'm not quite sure about that, which is demons or devils in Buddhism. 
<br>[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=863)   The original nightmare was an experience of an incubus or a succubus. 
<br>[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=870)   These are, like, creatures that sit on your chest, or they prod you or bite you or do weird things that are, like, very uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=883)   And this goes back centuries and centuries. 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=886)   You can look it up, succubus and incubus. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=888)   Those were the Latin terms for it. 
<br>[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=890)   But nightmare was the Anglo-Saxon. 
<br>[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=893)   So this sort of being paralyzed in sleep and having weird stuff happening, that's – there's a lot of cultural references to it. 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=903)   But each age interprets it differently. 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=905)   So in the Middle Ages, where people were superstitious in the Christian sense, they thought it was devils and things like that. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=913)   And nowadays people sort of have archetypes of sci-fi and space opera, so they experience it as an alien abduction. 
<br>[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=923)   So I know that I'm just in sleep paralysis. 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=927)   I don't believe it's actually happening, but it's very, very vivid. 
<br>[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=933)   It's as vivid as anything. 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=935)   But I don't know if this is true for other people, but I can tell you that when – as I'm waking up, as I'm waking up from this, 
<br>[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=958)   I could actually watch the transition between the two realities, the one where there's these aliens and they're doing this anal probe thing, okay, 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=971)   and then coming back to the current physical reality. 
<br>[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=977)   And I don't know if it's other people, it's the same or not, or this is just me. 
<br>[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=982)   But as I'm coming back to ordinary reality, the experience of the anal probe becomes the experience of detecting my pulse in that region of my body. 
<br>[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=998)   So apparently that's a slightly uncomfortable sensation if you're in a vulnerable sleep-like state and it gets interpreted. 
<br>[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1010)   At least that's my experience. And it's always that. I can detect my pulse there. 
<br>[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1016)   It has a physical basis. And I guess it's just a very sensitive region that when you're in a sleep state – 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1023)   Yeah, Louie's finding this hilarious. 
<br>[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1028)   Has it happened to you? 
<br>[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1031)   I refuse to talk about it. 
<br>[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1035)   I know, it's very painful. It's hard to talk about. 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1038)   I can't reveal the source of my laughter. I can't reveal why I'm laughing. 
<br>[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1043)   I see. Well, I tell you, I'm going to check to see if you've got a zipper back here. 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1054)   That you're just wearing a human suit of your love. 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1061)   Come to think of it, that seems plausible. 
<br>[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1066)   I remember you from somewhere. 
<br>[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1070)   Well, that is not a Dharma talk. 
<br>[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1076)   But they say you should tell stories. 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hKtH6ih1yA&t=1080)   That's how my ears got asymmetrical and how my mind got maybe commensurately warped. I don't know.
