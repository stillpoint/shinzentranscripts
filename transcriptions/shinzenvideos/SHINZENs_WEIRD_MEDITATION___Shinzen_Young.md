title: "SHINZEN's WEIRD MEDITATION  ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=0)   So, I've been told that people like it when I talk about myself, my own experiences and 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=11)   things like that. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=15)   So just for the heck of it, since I listen to your reports about your meditation, I thought 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=25)   you might, I don't know, for what it's worth, be interested in hearing my report about my 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=30)   meditation. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=31)   Now, this is just one person's experience, though, remember, so the danger in this is 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=38)   to think, well, that's what Shinzen does, so that's what I should be doing. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=45)   But not the case, profoundly not the case. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=53)   My standard answer to the question, how should I meditate, what's my standard answer? 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=63)   Whatever works. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=65)   Claims are made, systems have strong points, they have weak points. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=71)   And even a given individual may relate to one system at one point in their spiritual 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=76)   itinerary, they may relate to quite a different way of working later on. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=82)   So I'm not about to give the, I want to avoid giving the impression that there's a certain 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=91)   way that everybody should be doing practice. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=95)   So I had a really intense and unusual experience during the process as I was guiding you in 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=107)   meditation in your practice today. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=111)   So I wasn't following my own guidance, I got off on this other riff, okay. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=121)   So what happened was is that I was sort of doing a version of outer sea rest, okay, that's 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=137)   the like looking out but not at, sort of the defocusing of the eyes that you know about. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=146)   But I did a variation on it. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=149)   It was sort of like a combination of sea out and sea rest, in the sense that I experimented 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=161)   to see how, with making a very, very small aperture, but just enough of an aperture that 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=174)   pretty vivid patches of color would appear, okay. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=181)   And so it was sort of like sea out because it was color but it was right on the cusp 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=189)   of this urge to look at it as an object, okay, right on the cusp. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=196)   So what I saw was this field of patches of different colors that was the room in all 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=204)   of you folks. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=207)   And then I sort of collapsed the distance between me and those color patches. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=214)   And those color patches were like paper thin but very vivid. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=219)   It was like really, you know, it's interesting the word in Sanskrit, rupa, is ambiguous. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=228)   It means both color and form. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=231)   So it means color, it means form, but it also means matter in the sense of materiality. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=239)   And you have to be a little careful when reading traditional Buddhist literature because sometimes 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=243)   like in the phrase nama rupa, in this case rupa means matter as opposed to nama which 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=250)   is mind. 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=251)   But in other cases it literally means color or form, etc. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=258)   So I was looking at rupa in the sense of just patches of color. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=267)   So it was like really vivid, bright, but like paper thin. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=276)   And what that created was this huge need to look at what the object was, to not look at 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=291)   it as just a patch of color. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=294)   And it was a need that I can only describe as being like the need to breathe. 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=303)   It was like I'm just going to die unless I objectify that color patch, those patches, 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=313)   and look at them as people and the room and so forth. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=321)   And the way that it, the form that it took was that, okay, so the subject of self, see 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=328)   in, hear in, feel in. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=332)   Now there are many layers of activation within that system. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=340)   There's the surface that you could be aware of, but then below the surface there are subtle 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=347)   associational spreads. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=350)   There are, they are many, but they're much lighter, thinner in a sense. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=357)   And then around those are subtler spreads. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=362)   So it's not like there's just three strands, see, mental image, mental talk, and emotional 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=368)   body. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=369)   If you think of it as like three colors, so imagine that you have this big red, this big 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=380)   red rope, but when you look really carefully, carefully at that red rope, it's got like 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=387)   green and blue mixed in. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=390)   And then if you take one of those little strands of green or blue, you see, well, you know 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=394)   what, it's got some red and some other thing mixed in. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=397)   So it's really tangled, and it's tangled at many scales of subtlety. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=405)   So I didn't have any surface, I didn't have much surface organized, see in, hear in, feel 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=416)   in, in the sense of the ordinary self kind of arising. 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=422)   But I was aware of this undercurrent, this constant deep, deep, deep sort of swirling 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=434)   of subtle see in, hear in, feel in that was going on, and what it was trying to do is 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=441)   make sense of things. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=444)   And so that was part of what was driving that urge to objectify the patches of color. 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=452)   But that wasn't the main thing that was driving the urge. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=457)   I don't know if I should even talk, I mean, you know, people say they want me to do this, 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=461)   but I can see it's already getting weird and it's going to get weirder. 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=466)   So I've never tried this before, so we'll just see what happens. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=471)   Okay, so there's this sort of background of really deep, really subtle flowing see in, 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=480)   hear in, feel in that's so deep and so subtle that it's not really clear what it is. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=488)   But it's churning down there and it's trying to make sense of the world. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=494)   But what was really interesting was that, I don't know how to put it, cutting through, 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=505)   like you know, like a hot knife through butter. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=509)   So cutting through that was this constant movement of incandescent terror, to borrow 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=528)   a phrase from T.S. 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=531)   Jackson, that would go away if I only looked at the world the way I usually look at it. 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=540)   And it was deep and just hot, that's the only way I can describe it to you. 
<br>[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=552)   But because of years and years and years of practice, it was flowing. 
<br>[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=558)   So it was also blissful. 
<br>[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=560)   But it was absolutely incandescent, paralytic terror, associated with being right on the 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=569)   cusp. 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=574)   You know, it's like withholding an orgasm or something, sorry, okay I knew it was coming. 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=583)   I just got it. 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=584)   But, okay, but I'm not, I'm sorry, that's what it was like. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=593)   And the urge was, in this case, was to objectify the patches of dark and bright, the patches 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=600)   of colors. 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=601)   It was like, I just have to, but I'm not, I'm gonna suspend that. 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=607)   And what was driving it was the terror. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=609)   But fortunately it was flowing so it was actually pleasant. 
<br>[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=616)   And otherwise it would be impossible to do this. 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=621)   So it was like this magic world. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=630)   Because there was, my eyes, so then I was experimenting with aperture, okay, like how 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=638)   wide can I get it and still just see patches of color and not give in to that need to make 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=644)   an object. 
<br>[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=645)   Sasaki Roshi, some of you know this story, the first time I ever had a sanzen, or what 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=655)   they call sanzen in Japanese, it's a one-on-one zen interview. 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=660)   First time I ever had sanzen with him. 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=663)   I can't remember exactly what he says, most of our sanzens were in Japanese, but, and 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=672)   this was once. 
<br>[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=674)   I don't remember the exact words, but I remember the general purport, which was, okay, Shinzen, 
<br>[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=686)   you've been a monk in Japan, you know what this trip is about. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=691)   I'm tired of these wimpy Americans. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=694)   I expect you to reach the point where you never need to make an object out of self or 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=705)   world again. 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=709)   Okay, now, sometimes zen teachers intentionally use ambiguous language, but other times zen 
<br>[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=724)   teachers are very, very precise in their language. 
<br>[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=731)   Did you hear exactly what he said? 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=733)   Because this was precise, okay. 
<br>[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=735)   He didn't say, reach the point where you don't make an object out of the world or the self. 
<br>[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=741)   He said, reach the point where you no longer need to make an object out of the world. 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=747)   But I'll tell you what arose in my image space when he said that. 
<br>[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=752)   I had this image of him handing me a revolver and saying, okay, here's the gun, here's the 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=760)   bullets, put it to your head and blow it off, because, I mean, not make an object. 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=766)   You're dead, right? 
<br>[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=767)   I mean, if you're not making corpses, don't make an object out of self. 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=774)   But what the saving grace was is that I could see moment by moment, just by watching him, 
<br>[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=781)   that indeed, that's what he was experiencing. 
<br>[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=784)   I could also see that that did not one whit interfere with his ability to enjoy life and 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=794)   to deal with life in an efficacious way. 
<br>[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=799)   In fact, it very much empowered both of those. 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=804)   So I had this living proof that as counterintuitive as it might seem, it's like, who wants that? 
<br>[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=813)   I could see he was doing it. 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=816)   It was evident in his body language. 
<br>[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=819)   And I could see it really worked. 
<br>[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=821)   It made him happy and powerful in the world. 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=827)   So I guess it was okay. 
<br>[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=831)   If I were to describe the body language, I would say that he has the body language of 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=838)   Ray Charles. 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=839)   Now, if you've ever watched Ray Charles, it's like, you sort of can't take your eyes off 
<br>[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=845)   him. 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=846)   It's just something that you don't know what it is, but you just, you're mesmerized. 
<br>[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=854)   Well, what I think you're seeing is there's one blind man that completely accepts his 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=862)   blindness. 
<br>[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=863)   He does not need anymore to see the world as an object, and that's reflected in his 
<br>[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=869)   body language. 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=877)   So this was sort of a case in point. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=880)   I could really see the structure of what was like driving me to turn colors of patches 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=888)   into people and objects and rooms and so forth, colored patches. 
<br>[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=893)   So because of the years of training and skill and whatever, I was able to just maintain 
<br>[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=900)   this indefinitely. 
<br>[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=901)   And it was like really, really fun. 
<br>[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=908)   So it was an interesting, you know, sort of, ah, I see that's one way that these sensory 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=920)   structures work. 
<br>[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=921)   But then it got weirder. 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=925)   Got really weird. 
<br>[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=930)   Because we're in this church, right? 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=934)   Chapel. 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=935)   And it became every church in the world and every synagogue and every mosque and every 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=946)   guru bar, etc., etc., etc. 
<br>[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=950)   I mean like in a really tangible way. 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=956)   Like a really tangible way. 
<br>[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=963)   And then I was thinking, oh, I remember something a little like this many, many decades ago. 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=974)   And you know what that was, right? 
<br>[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=979)   Psychedelics. 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=980)   Except no psychedelics. 
<br>[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=983)   This is 100% attentional skills. 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=991)   Attention, clarity, equanimity, that's it. 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=994)   But it was a trip. 
<br>[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=997)   And unlike psychedelics, it didn't just go away. 
<br>[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1001)   It's like just there and there and there and there. 
<br>[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1004)   So there was this sense of transcending time and space in a very tangible way. 
<br>[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1014)   Now why would that happen? 
<br>[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1017)   I wasn't really seeing the chapel as an object, but some part of me was processing it as what 
<br>[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1027)   it was, but more in the sense of the platonic ideal. 
<br>[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1034)   You know, it's interesting we have this word ideal. 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1038)   If you look it up historically, it comes from a notion of Plato, that there are these universal 
<br>[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1045)   perfect forms. 
<br>[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1048)   And it's quite evident from reading Plato that he didn't just come up with this entirely 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1054)   by intellectual speculation. 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1061)   I think he had actual experiences. 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1064)   So these idealized perfect forms of things is an aspect of how deep image space works. 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1080)   I do a lot of my practice in visual experience. 
<br>[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1085)   Yesterday I mentioned that you don't necessarily have to maintain a formal technique all the 
<br>[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1094)   day. 
<br>[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1095)   For most people that's just not feasible, and you shouldn't think of that as a defeat, 
<br>[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1100)   but you should have some practice in life, you should touch base. 
<br>[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1104)   But actually I do attempt to maintain technique during most of the day. 
<br>[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1111)   And if I am not doing the technique, it's actually a conscious decision, so it's almost 
<br>[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1116)   the other way around. 
<br>[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1117)   I decide, okay, let's take a little vacation, let's not get one-sided here, let's just go 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1122)   unconscious and munch on a burrito and watch TV or whatever, without practicing. 
<br>[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1133)   But usually, like now, I have a technique going, right now as I'm talking to you. 
<br>[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1140)   And once again I hesitate to talk about it because it's like, well, okay, that's what 
<br>[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1145)   he does, so that's what I should be doing, it's not that. 
<br>[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1148)   But what I find, what allows me to be continuously tasting a deep meditative state is see out. 
<br>[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1159)   And I alluded to that earlier today when I said, you know, there's like a hundred thousand 
<br>[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1166)   shifts in the visual field. 
<br>[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1168)   See out, gone, see out, gone, see out, gone, see out, gone, see out, gone. 
<br>[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1175)   I'm actually verbalizing exactly what I'm noting, but the noting is on autopilot. 
<br>[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1182)   It just happens in the visual field for me. 
<br>[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1185)   But it took years and years and years of practice. 
<br>[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1189)   The first koan that Sasaki Roshi gave in that first interview, where, as I say, he handed 
<br>[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1196)   me the revolver and said, I want you to spiritually kill yourself, not physically. 
<br>[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1203)   The first koan was, when you see the flower, how do you experience true love? 
<br>[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1210)   And then when you can't do it, he says, okay, I'll make it easier. 
<br>[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1217)   When you see the flower, how do you experience God? 
<br>[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1219)   Oh, you don't get it yet? 
<br>[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1222)   Okay, like five months later, okay, well, I'll make it easier. 
<br>[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1226)   When you see the flower, how do you become free from yourself? 
<br>[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1230)   It's all the same thing, right? 
<br>[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1235)   Well, how do you become free from yourself? 
<br>[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1238)   Well, how does the self arise? 
<br>[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1240)   When the eyes are turned towards a flower, a self is going to arise as he in here and 
<br>[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1247)   feel it, isn't it? 
<br>[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1249)   Well if that doesn't arise, and if the visual field does not fixate, he can tell by your 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1258)   body language and so forth, that's how you pass the koan, not by explaining everything. 
<br>[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1266)   You have to actually see the flower and everything. 
<br>[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1270)   Because then the next thing is, okay, you experience God when you see the flower, now 
<br>[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1275)   how do you experience God when you see Roshi? 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1277)   Okay, now you've got to look at him and do it. 
<br>[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1285)   And you'll be amazed, even though you know exactly what you're supposed to do, it ain't 
<br>[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1289)   so easy. 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1290)   They took him to see a Charlie Chaplin movie once, and afterwards they asked him, Roshi, 
<br>[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1299)   what do you think of Charlie Chaplin? 
<br>[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1302)   And he said, Charlie Chaplin, very great actor, but I am a better actor. 
<br>[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1312)   It's an authentic American Zen story. 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1323)   Meaning someone told me it, and it should have happened even if it didn't. 
<br>[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1329)   One of the monks told me that that happened, so let's propagate that. 
<br>[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1336)   I wasn't there. 
<br>[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1341)   But I'll tell you, I was there translating when he said that enlightened masters should 
<br>[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1350)   model themselves on scientists. 
<br>[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1355)   And I mean, Sasaki Roshi is an old timer, 105 years old. 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1363)   What does that mean? 
<br>[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1364)   Well, did you see the movie The Last Samurai? 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1368)   If you saw that movie, that movie took place at the transition from feudalism to modern 
<br>[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1376)   Japan. 
<br>[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1377)   And there was a young emperor, remember the kid that he talks to that is the emperor when 
<br>[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1384)   he finally meets the emperor? 
<br>[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1386)   That was emperor Meiji. 
<br>[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1388)   So Sasaki Roshi can remember that emperor's funeral. 
<br>[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1394)   He's just one generation out of medieval Japan. 
<br>[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1401)   So for such an old timer to have such a radical notion, and it was specific, science improves 
<br>[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1412)   in each generation. 
<br>[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1415)   The paradigms and technologies of enlightenment should model themselves on that. 
<br>[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1421)   They should improve with each generation. 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1425)   If you're as enlightened as your teacher, if you're as good a teacher as your teacher, 
<br>[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1432)   you only have half the virtue of your teacher, is the phrase that he used. 
<br>[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1438)   Okay, well, that's a whole other little riff. 
<br>[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1441)   Let's get back to my epiphany in the chapel. 
<br>[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1446)   So what's going on here? 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1450)   Why would the, you know, I'm not exactly into mystical schmistical, okay, but this is sensory 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1458)   experience that is significant. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1463)   Why would this happen? 
<br>[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1465)   Well, it has to do with the freeing up of the deep levels of visual association. 
<br>[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1477)   There's see out and there's see in. 
<br>[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1482)   What's behind see out? 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1483)   Well, presumably what's behind see out is an endless chain of causality that has led 
<br>[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1491)   to this object or that object and so forth. 
<br>[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1496)   That's called pratityasamutpada in traditional Buddhism, usually translated as a conditioned 
<br>[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1504)   co-arising. 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1505)   Although utpada is a very interesting word because ut, it's actually cognate to the English 
<br>[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1512)   word out, but in Sanskrit it doesn't mean out, it means up, up. 
<br>[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1518)   And padati means to fall, so utpadati means to fall up. 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1524)   So you know what it means to fall down, it just happens. 
<br>[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1527)   A leaf falls, it just happens. 
<br>[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1533)   This world, according to Buddhism, falls up into existence, the way a leaf falls down, 
<br>[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1542)   which is rather extraordinarily similar to a notion in physics called entropy. 
<br>[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1549)   Is that a coincidence? 
<br>[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1553)   Maybe. 
<br>[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1554)   But to me it's intriguing. 
<br>[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1558)   So pratitya means connected, or interdependent. 
<br>[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1566)   Samut means together, ut means up, and pada means falling. 
<br>[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1573)   So falling up together through interconnectedness. 
<br>[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1577)   The Japanese word is much shorter, it's engi. 
<br>[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1583)   Ti means arising, and en means connection, so connection arising, engi. 
<br>[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1591)   In Mandarin Chinese it would be pronounced yuanqi. 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1595)   Now what's interesting is that as a technical term, engi means what I just said, it translates 
<br>[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1603)   the Sanskrit pratityasamutpada. 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1607)   But it's also an ordinary colloquial word in Japanese that, well actually the n part 
<br>[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1622)   of it, which is an abbreviation of engi, the n is an ordinary word in Japanese that means 
<br>[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1634)   relationship or connection. 
<br>[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1636)   If you sense that you have a natural connection with someone, then they say you have n with 
<br>[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1644)   that person. 
<br>[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1647)   So the flower koan, there's another version of the flower koan. 
<br>[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1655)   The older version, when I first started translating for him, wasn't how do you see God when you 
<br>[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1661)   see the flower. 
<br>[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1663)   For years he talked about how do you make a relationship with the flower. 
<br>[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1668)   Of course it's exactly the same thing. 
<br>[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1671)   It's another way to say, and if you think he's talking about different things, then 
<br>[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1675)   you get really confused. 
<br>[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1676)   And of course as soon as he says relationship, then it's like people get all tripped out 
<br>[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1684)   on relationship. 
<br>[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1685)   It's like a big buzzword for people, a big hot, warm, cold button, what have you. 
<br>[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1693)   So then you're all tripped out on that. 
<br>[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1695)   You don't really listen to what he means by relationship. 
<br>[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1699)   But of course he's also implying that interpersonal relationships are best dealt with the same 
<br>[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1707)   way you relate to experiencing God when you see the flower. 
<br>[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1713)   Because after you pass the flower and you look at him, then he says, okay when you see 
<br>[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1718)   your lover, how do you experience freedom from yourself, etc. 
<br>[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1726)   So this connectivity, as you well know, I don't claim, I try to be very, what would 
<br>[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1741)   be the word, modest in my claims. 
<br>[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1747)   I don't really claim to know any reality other than how the senses work. 
<br>[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1755)   So I don't know what's out there in terms of the objective world. 
<br>[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1760)   But if I had to make a guess as to what's behind see out, what we're actually looking 
<br>[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1769)   at when we look at this color and form, which as you can see is quite labile, my guess would 
<br>[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1780)   be that it's a vast network of connections without any things being connected. 
<br>[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1790)   Now, hey, don't meditate on this, okay. 
<br>[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1796)   This is just, I said, if I had to make a wild guess. 
<br>[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1799)   You know, what's really interesting is, and once again this is probably just a coincidence, 
<br>[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1810)   but if I say mathematics, most of you probably think, well, it's very abstract. 
<br>[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1821)   Especially, say, upper division or university level mathematics, sort of like abstract. 
<br>[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1835)   Among mathematicians, there's a branch of mathematics that they consider abstract. 
<br>[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1843)   If you read any Wikipedia article on any math topic, you know how the Wikipedia, it's organized 
<br>[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1854)   in a certain way. 
<br>[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1855)   The first sentence is supposed to be something that a high school or junior high person can 
<br>[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1861)   understand. 
<br>[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1862)   And the first paragraph is supposed to be something that certainly most people can understand. 
<br>[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1870)   But then they're allowed to go deeper and deeper and deeper into a subject. 
<br>[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1876)   So that by the time you reach the end, at least in the math articles, you're dealing 
<br>[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1880)   with the most advanced levels of mathematics. 
<br>[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1884)   Like if you look up multiplication, for example, it will start with what you learned when you 
<br>[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1890)   were six years old. 
<br>[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1891)   But in the end, there's going to be something that is so abstract that you will wonder what 
<br>[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1898)   in the world is this. 
<br>[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1901)   And that the last part of each article on math topics in the Wikipedia is taken from 
<br>[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1909)   that branch of mathematics that even mathematicians jokingly refer to as generalized abstract 
<br>[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1918)   nonsense. 
<br>[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1921)   And just for your reference, oh, by the way, how many times have you heard me say the way 
<br>[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1931)   to learn technical terms is to not attempt to associate them with what they mean in ordinary 
<br>[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1940)   English. 
<br>[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1941)   That will completely and totally screw you up. 
<br>[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1949)   Right? 
<br>[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1950)   When I try to explain what see in, hear in, feel in, et cetera, et cetera, I ask you, 
<br>[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1956)   don't associate it with ordinary English. 
<br>[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1958)   These are going to be defined in a certain way. 
<br>[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1960)   So anyway, I'm going to tell you what this branch of mathematics is called. 
<br>[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1963)   And it's an ordinary word. 
<br>[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1965)   And you're going to think it has something to do with what you think that word means. 
<br>[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1969)   And it don't. 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1970)   Or if it does, it's like so beyond that you don't have to worry about it. 
<br>[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1979)   Anyway, it's called category theory. 
<br>[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1982)   You can look it up if you want to really see something abstract. 
<br>[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1986)   Why do I even mention this? 
<br>[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=1987)   Well, what's interesting is that many mathematicians believe that this is the foundations of mathematics, 
<br>[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2004)   not set theory. 
<br>[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2008)   This is really the deepest, most powerful statement that math has made to date. 
<br>[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2017)   And if mathematics is the language of physics, and physics is the language of our best understanding 
<br>[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2025)   of the material world, then what's at the base of mathematics may, I don't know, maybe 
<br>[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2037)   have something to do with what's at the base of spirituality. 
<br>[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2042)   Anyway, why I mention this is, in this particular branch of mathematics, the only thing that 
<br>[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2055)   you're interested in is arrows that point. 
<br>[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2063)   And what do they point to? 
<br>[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2064)   Other arrows. 
<br>[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2067)   The objects are just arrows pointing to themselves. 
<br>[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2072)   It looks and smells like pratityasamutpada. 
<br>[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2078)   It's just this connected to this, it points this way, it points that way. 
<br>[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2084)   But there's no thingness here. 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2087)   It's all directions and relations. 
<br>[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2092)   And it turns out that that's our most powerful statement. 
<br>[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2098)   And our ordinary arithmetic is a trivial consequence of this. 
<br>[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2106)   So anyway, if I had to make a guess, I think that there are just arrows pointing to arrows 
<br>[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2113)   pointing to arrows pointing to arrows. 
<br>[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2114)   This being that is not, this not being that is not, okay, you may have heard the talk 
<br>[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2120)   in those terms. 
<br>[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2121)   So there's this vast realm of connectivity, presumably, that is what is. 
<br>[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2130)   Color and form appear, my guess is that color and form are an abbreviated language that 
<br>[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2136)   the brain has come up with in order to represent what, in a way convenient to our species, 
<br>[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2146)   that vast network. 
<br>[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2147)   This is just a conjecture on my part. 
<br>[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2150)   But what I can tell you for sure is that when you look into image space, when you look visually 
<br>[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2157)   in the other direction, you actually see that vast network. 
<br>[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2162)   Which is your imaginesmundi, your stored images of the world. 
<br>[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2171)   It's constantly flipping through them like a rolodex at lightning speed. 
<br>[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2177)   When you look at the image space, when you look at the blank mental screen, sometimes 
<br>[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2184)   you might notice that there's a kind of shimmering there. 
<br>[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2190)   That can be various things, it can have physical causes. 
<br>[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2194)   But one of the things that it can be is the subconscious visual mind flipping through 
<br>[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2198)   the rolodex. 
<br>[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2200)   And you can get a sense that you're looking at worlds, and some of those worlds are memory, 
<br>[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2209)   but some of them are fantasy worlds, mythological worlds, possum worlds. 
<br>[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2216)   There's just a lot down there, and it just propagates. 
<br>[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2221)   But it's all color and form, just very, very subtle. 
<br>[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2230)   But it's the part that's so far in, it is me, you, it's my visual mind, but it's the 
<br>[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2241)   sort of part of me that is so far in that's sort of out. 
<br>[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2247)   It sort of connects with that other network. 
<br>[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2254)   So I think that's why I was in every church and mosque and synagogue, because the inner 
<br>[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2267)   and outer visual worlds were all getting unfixated and merging. 
<br>[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2277)   So it was really interesting that the fear level, like I say, it was like paralytic, 
<br>[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2285)   incandescent terror, just slowly sort of like, I don't know, like seaweed in a tide pool 
<br>[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2294)   just moving through my whole body. 
<br>[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2297)   And it was like, you know, it was scary, but it was blissful at the same time. 
<br>[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSobyZjJSvs&t=2306)   So that was my morning. 
<br>
