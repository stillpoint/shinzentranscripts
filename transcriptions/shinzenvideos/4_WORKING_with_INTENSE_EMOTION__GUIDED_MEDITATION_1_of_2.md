<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=0)   Okay. 
<br>[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=1)   So, let's do it. 
<br>[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=4)   Okay. 
<br>[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=5)   Okay, so take a moment to stretch up and settle in and focus for just a second on physical 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=16)   relaxation into the posture. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=23)   Okay, we're going to start by working in the fierce, sad system. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=43)   So at any given instant, there'll be exactly one of four states, just fear, just sad, both 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=56)   or neither. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=57)   We're going to ignore everything else. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=59)   We're just going to penetrate that one system of affective somesthesia. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=66)   My way of talking make sense? 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=68)   Well, until the last two words. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=70)   I know what you meant. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=71)   I know, I know. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=72)   That's Greco-Roman for emotional type body sensation. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=78)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=79)   I love it though. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=80)   I know. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=81)   So, I'd like you to note fear, sad, fear and sad, or none, one of those four. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=93)   You want fear and sad or both? 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=96)   Just use fear and sad with a Boolean and operation. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=102)   We'll get the four logically possible states of the fierce sadness system. 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=110)   Any questions about that? 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=112)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=115)   Out loud? 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=116)   Yeah, for starters. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=119)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=123)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=128)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=133)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=139)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=140)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=142)   Now go to mental labels. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=144)   See the labels rather than speaking them. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=166)   Is it still mostly both at the same time? 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=183)   Yes. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=184)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=185)   Now we're going to work just with the fear. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=193)   I'm assuming that there is one or more areas of local intensity for the fear. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=199)   Is that correct? 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=200)   Yes. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=201)   Is it one or are there several disconnected? 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=205)   There's probably one primary one that spreads out and has little branches to it, and then 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=212)   there's a little bit of a journey to a secondary one for the most part. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=218)   Okay. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=219)   So the primary one spreads branches. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=222)   The primary one is right at the center of my chest, like right in between my rib cage. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=230)   How broadly are the branches spread through the body? 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=236)   It kind of comes down around to the side and in there, but it kind of spreads out a bit 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=243)   like the core, the center is kind of there in a kind of big, odd shape, and then there 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=251)   are ways in which I think it kind of reaches subtly, like subtle veins kind of going out 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=258)   around to the middle of my back. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=261)   Okay. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=262)   Excellent detection skill. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=264)   I'm assuming that the subtler ramifications are of less intensity? 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=271)   Absolutely. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=272)   Here's what we're going to do. 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=275)   We're going to just work with fear. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=276)   Each time you note sad, I would like you to zoom out to the subtle ramifications, focus 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=283)   on them only. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=284)   Every time I note sad? 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=286)   I'm sorry, every time you note fear. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=288)   Go out to the subtle ramifications and work towards perfect equanimity with those subtle 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=294)   sensations. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=295)   Because they're subtle, it may be possible to have complete openness with them, even 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=300)   though you can't do so with the local intensities that are at the epicenter of it. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=307)   So we're going to use the zoom out option on the noting. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=311)   You're going to zoom out to cover the subtle spread and work towards perfect equanimity 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=319)   with that. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=320)   And don't concern yourself with the local splash at the center at all, just with the 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=326)   global ripple in a rhythm with the mental labels of fear. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=334)   Any questions about that? 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=336)   No, you want me... 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=338)   I'll just repeat it back. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=341)   I'm going to keep noting fear with mental labels, but I'm going to, when I note fear, 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=347)   zoom out to the subtler tributaries, so to speak, of the experience of fear in my body, 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=357)   not tuning into the main Grand Central Station part of it. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=365)   That's perfect. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=366)   And by mental label I mean think toward fear, to indicate that that's the flavor. 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=373)   And then you zoom out, and then I'm just going to have you do that on your own for a few 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=378)   minutes. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=379)   To show that one, that you are focusing on that. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=408)   I want to do that pretty good. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=426)   Is there any hint of flow in the global spread of the fear? 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=434)   It's pretty fluid? 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=435)   Yeah, it flows. 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=438)   It's interesting. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=442)   I tend to be flowy in general, but when I worked with this, at first I got little hits 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=449)   of nausea. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=450)   I started to feel a little nauseous. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=451)   Other flavors. 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=452)   Yeah, and then a little ticklish, but if I just kind of kept with it, those would just 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=458)   stay. 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=459)   They dissipate. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=460)   So you're able to get the global component in the fear flavor to flow. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=471)   Can that flow spread into the local intensity so that you get a local global flow with the 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=478)   fear? 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=479)   You know, I think I started to naturally start to do that, and I think that's when the nausea 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=484)   started. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=485)   I think my body... 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=486)   Let's go for local global flow now. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=488)   So that means you'll remember that there's, in my standard formulation of the noting technique, 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=494)   you remember zoom in, zoom out, zoom both ways. 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=497)   So we're going to zoom both ways, out to the perimeter, to the weak sensations there, and 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=503)   ride the momentum of the flow that's there, and simultaneously zoom into the core intensity 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=510)   and see if you can get them to get that local splash, global ripple. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=518)   While keeping the zooming, so simultaneously. 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=520)   Yeah, you're zooming in and out, into the core, out to the perimeter, and you're doing 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=526)   that precisely to facilitate the spread of the global flow into the local intensity. 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=537)   So the awareness is moving in and out. 
<br>[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=541)   In and out at the same time. 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=544)   You have a phrase that you came up with. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=546)   Sliding. 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=547)   You're going to slide in both ways. 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=548)   You're going to slide out with your awareness and let it facilitate a global circulation 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=554)   of fear, and you're going to slide in and let that facilitate a local circulation of 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=561)   fear. 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIp547qQGQ&t=562)   So you get both the intense areas and the peripheral areas as a single fear flow. 
<br>
