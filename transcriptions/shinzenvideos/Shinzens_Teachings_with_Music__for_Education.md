<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=0)   I understand that you have some programs that are based on your techniques that have started 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=13)   to be employed in various places. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=15)   And I wondered if there is something that you can share with us about what's happening 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=20)   with aspects of your basic mindfulness. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=23)   I know sometimes a particular focus, whether for pain or music or something like that. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=31)   Is there something that you could share with us in terms of how your techniques are being 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=35)   employed in maybe institutions or educationally or health facilities? 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=41)   I think the two things that come to mind immediately are that other teachers are using my materials 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=52)   to teach meditation, the YouTube materials. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=57)   So they're capturing YouTube segments and using them in the curriculum. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=66)   And I think that that's being done both for people teaching meditation pragmatically in 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=74)   the public, but also for people teaching courses on meditation in universities or courses that 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=81)   may be like Buddhism, Asian culture, comparative mysticism, that kind of thing, where academic 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=92)   professors are assigning some of my YouTube segments to supplement the supplementary materials. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=103)   So that's one area. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=108)   Then probably the most exciting thing is the development of music-based mindfulness for 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=115)   kids. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=117)   And they're doing that in Portland State, and it was phenomenally successful. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=122)   And we have Soryu's YouTube show, what we're doing in Burlington, Vermont. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=130)   Now Soryu is in the public school system. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=133)   First he was just in this after-school center with music-based mindfulness for kids. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=138)   Now he's in the public schools doing mindfulness. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63Svaef6P8&t=142)   And I think that's very exciting.
