title: "3 Things Shinzen got from Joshu Sasaki Roshi"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=0)   I've heard you speak of enlightened masters, and you spoke of Roshi as being a master's 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=13)   master when you met him. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=15)   And I've heard you tell stories of other teachers that you've lived with in your encounters. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=22)   I've never heard you, when you've talked about your influences, of what's influenced your 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=27)   teaching, I've heard you talk about an Uba Kin lineage or a Mahasi Sayadaw lineage in 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=33)   terms of what they brought in noting or body sensation. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=36)   But the only teacher I've heard you really speak of, and you shift totally when you talk 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=43)   about him, is Roshi. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=45)   Meaning Sasaki Roshi. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=47)   Roshi is a general title in Japanese for any Zen master is called a Roshi. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=54)   But yes, Joshu Sasaki Roshi. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=57)   And if there are other enlightened masters that might come into this conversation, we'll 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=64)   weave that too. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=65)   But my interest here would be to have you talk about what it's like to be in his presence 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=73)   and work with him, and what having this man's, I don't know, energy input into your life, 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=82)   what that is for you as a teacher, because I don't know who else you go to for your support. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=91)   When I came back to the United States, I realized I still needed a teacher, but I didn't have 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=101)   anybody that I could go to within the tradition that I wanted to work in, which is the mindfulness 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=108)   tradition. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=109)   And when I came back here for a few years, I was drawn to mindfulness because it could 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=115)   be extracted from the cultural milieu and the religious matrix of Buddhism and presented 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=123)   as a fully secular practice. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=125)   And so that appealed to me, and I liked the systematic nature of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=130)   But by the time that had happened, I was probably the senior mindfulness teacher in my part 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=139)   of the world, but I needed somebody vastly senior to myself to kick my ass. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=149)   And the only place I could find it was in the Zen tradition, which is not the tradition 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=154)   I really wanted to work in, although I was familiar with it because I had lived in Japan 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=161)   and so forth. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=163)   And Sasaki Roshi was certainly the senior Zen master in the United States at that time, 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=170)   and he's now arguably the senior living Buddhist master in the world at 102, having started 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=180)   his monastic practice at the age of 13, do the math. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=185)   How long has this guy been practicing? 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=188)   I had to study with someone, so it wasn't really in the tradition I was drawn to. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=193)   Do all teachers think I need someone to kick me in the ass? 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=199)   No, some people. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=201)   A lot do, but some people go off on a... that's one of the ways that the wheels sort of come 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=209)   off if a teacher doesn't put themselves under some other teacher. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=214)   They get a certain degree of experience and then they're sort of off, but now they don't 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=220)   have feedback loops and their students won't give them feedback because they're in awe 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=225)   of them and problems can develop. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=227)   So I wanted to make sure I'd seen... 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=229)   That's very healthy of you to have said I need somebody to... 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=233)   I think it's just a safety, it's like a safety net, you know, even though at that time I 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=239)   had practiced for a long time, I still wanted someone else. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=244)   I've gotten three things from him. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=246)   One is I learned not to suppress my sense of self. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=253)   In my initial years of practice, I thought, oh, the Buddha says enlightenment is no self. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=258)   If I have any sense of self, then I'm not making progress. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=263)   And suddenly I was suppressing self-referential body sensations, mental images, and internal 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=269)   talk, the stuff that's self-referential, that gives you the sense of self moment by moment. 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=275)   I was suppressing that. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=276)   I was trying to get rid of that. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=278)   And Sasaki Roshi is a very balanced teacher. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=282)   So he teaches that yes, there's no self, and then there's full self. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=288)   And those are both no self experiences. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=293)   Self is nothing whatsoever. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=296)   As T.S. Eliot said, the still point between two waves of the sea. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=301)   And then there is the wave, which is the personality arising not as a thing, but as a doing. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=311)   And I've been suppressing the doing of self. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=315)   And so he disabused me of that imbalance in my practice. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=320)   That was the first thing that happened. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=321)   By his example, or did he say? 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=322)   No, by his direct teachings. 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=323)   Okay. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=324)   By all, he constantly emphasized that we're always cycling between experiences of zero 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=331)   self and the re-arising of the feeling, thinking self. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=336)   And then it goes back to zero. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=337)   And this is a natural process. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=339)   Everybody participates in it. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=341)   Enlightened people realize they're participating in it. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=345)   And really enlightened people participate in it wholeheartedly without preference, one 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=351)   side versus the other. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=353)   So I got, he disabused me of my notion of preferring no self to fullness of, to unfixated 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=362)   self. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=363)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=364)   Then he gave me the paradigm of impermanence in terms of expansion and contraction, which 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=370)   represents a vast generalization of the early Buddhist concept of anicca or impermanence. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=379)   And it's a far more flexible and encompassing model and puts a whole positive spin on what 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=386)   in early Buddhism was sort of looked at as part of suffering and had a negative spin. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=392)   So I got that expansion contraction paradigm, which very nicely maps onto mathematics and 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=397)   physics and it's just a very, very useful way of guiding people into the experience 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=402)   of impermanence. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=403)   I got that from him. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=405)   The other thing I got from him was sort of the direct vibe of when, because when you're 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=410)   with him, he's space expanding and contracting and that tends to reach out and sort of pull 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=416)   you into his world. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=419)   But then you have to go back to the meditation hall and you have to internalize that zap 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=424)   of energy. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=425)   See, some people, they get Shaktipat, they get a zap of energy from a teacher, but then 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=430)   what do they do immediately after that? 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=433)   Well, they sing bhajans to the teacher and they talk about how great the teacher is and 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=438)   et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=440)   So it becomes a whole devotional thing. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=442)   And then they're just a leaky capacitor that loses that Shakti and then they need another 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=447)   recharging. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=448)   Okay. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=449)   What I like about Zen is they never talk about it, but when you go in for the Zen interview, 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=455)   you get a zap of the flow of nothingness from that teacher. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=460)   But then what do you do? 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=461)   You sit around and then sing the praises of that teacher and get into a whole cult? 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=468)   No, they send you back to the meditation hall where it's cold in the winter or there's bugs 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=474)   biting you in the summer. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=478)   You're sleepy, you're getting beat up, you're getting yelled at. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=483)   All of this shit is happening. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=485)   How can you apply that flow that you got from the teacher to this situation? 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=493)   Meaning can you internalize it and truly make it yours so you become like that teacher, 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=498)   not a devotee of that teacher? 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=501)   That's the difference between the guru zap in one tradition and in the Zen tradition. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=509)   And I got that from him within that context. 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=512)   So those three things, disabusing me of my subtle tendency to suppress the self, giving 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=519)   me this incredibly powerful paradigm that maps nicely onto science with regards to impermanence 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=526)   as the fundamental insight, and then a sort of direct transfer of that flow of impermanence 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=535)   from him, but within the context of making me strong and independent of him because I 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdP1gQBlvAE&t=542)   would immediately have to go and actually apply and internalize it and make it my own. 
<br>
