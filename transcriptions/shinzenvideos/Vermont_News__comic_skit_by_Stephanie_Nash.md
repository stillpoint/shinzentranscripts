<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=0)   Oh, this just in. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=22)   We have an on the scene live report from Melanie Mash in Burlington. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=27)   Thanks, Bob. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=29)   I am here on the west side of Burlington, Vermont, just outside the forest next to Lake 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=35)   Champlain. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=36)   A possibly homeless man who locals have reported often meanders in the very well maintained 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=44)   paths of the forest and is reported to go by the name the Head Chin or the Big Chin 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=51)   was seen drunkenly walking down the path muttering 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=59)   5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=60)   And he kept waving and pointing to a piece of paper with nonsensical symbols on it, muttering 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=67)   that it had his whole system on there and that he looked at it every day and that it 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=73)   was the solution to McDermott. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=78)   He was in a trench coat, which he called his robes, and wearing a sign that said on the 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=83)   front, think dimensionally, and on the back, optimize the happy. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=90)   Then he returned to this kind of spastic walking, telling the crowd that he was auto-walking 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=96)   and that they should try auto-thinking so that they could meet Gus. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=102)   We're not sure who Gus is, possibly an imaginary friend. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=109)   Everyone assumed at this point that the man was intoxicated and then he started marching 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=116)   and chanting, Trump is empty, Obama is empty. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=122)   And that's when a real crowd started to gather, assuming it was actually a political rally. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=130)   People wanted to join in the chant, but were confused as to which side he was on. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=137)   When someone asked him, he stopped and looked at them and said, the source, and so are you, 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=144)   and everything is loved into existence in each moment. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=149)   At which point they assumed this wasn't political after all, but that he was a religious fanatic. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=157)   But then he asked if anyone had some Kickapoo joy juice, and then said that he had been 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=163)   abducted by aliens who did a lot of anal probing. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=169)   Yes, Bob, that's when they realized he was delusional and the authorities were called. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=177)   And then he returned to the counting and walking, only to stop and declare that he had no self, 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=184)   which had a bounciness and connectivity. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=188)   And then he proceeded to say he could see, hear, and feel while waving his arms and pretending 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=193)   to have a theory. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=195)   By this point, there was a huge crowd around him who seemed to be enjoying this display. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=201)   Some were even drawn in and soon others were walking around chanting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=208)   7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=209)   And that's when we arrived, Bob. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=211)   And I tell you, I have never seen anything like it. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=215)   I think the guy was just some kind of hypnotist. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=219)   When the police arrived, they came towards him and he said he wanted to wrestle like 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=223)   he did with his TA when he was stoned. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=227)   And that's when one officer approached him slowly saying that everything was going to 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=233)   be okay. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=235)   To which the man said, it was more than okay. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=239)   Everything was enfolded with an expansion and contraction, which arose out of and returned 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=245)   to the source. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=247)   Then he pointed to a garbage can and insisted he could merge with it. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=253)   The officer said that he wanted the man to get into the car. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=257)   And then the man, called the Big Shin, pointed to the car and said he had been in one of 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=263)   those, and that it had rolled over and over and slid under a semi and that was how he 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=270)   lost his ear. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=271)   But it wasn't a bad trip. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=274)   Oh, yes, Bob, he seemed to have both his ears. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=279)   The officer then asked if there were drugs involved and the Big Shin said, yes, LSD. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=287)   But then he giggled and confided that no one knew. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=291)   So the police officer assured him that now he knew and that they needed him to get into 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=298)   the car. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=299)   The man asked if instead they could go on a motorcycle at 100 miles per hour with no 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=304)   self-driving or pretend it was an ox and ride backwards. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=309)   And the officer said, no. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=315)   To which the man pretended to ring a bell and then said, that car is empty. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=321)   The officer then said that the empty backseat was going to be full in a moment and asked 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=325)   the man if he could see how many fingers he was holding up. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=329)   The man then approached the officer, looked deeply into his eyes, and in a slow, meaningful 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=335)   way asked the officer, who is seeing? 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=341)   Whereupon the officer disappeared. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=344)   Vanished. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=345)   I kid you not, Bob. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=348)   Then the man, the Big Shin, pointed quickly and shouted, gone. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=354)   Well the entire crowd erupted in applause, assuming this was all part of a magic act. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=360)   This had all just been a show and a good one too, Bob, I must say. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=367)   Well the Big Shin, as we'll now call him, turned to the crowd and told them that he 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=371)   had a book on how to do this, but that it was in R&D and for now everyone could just 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=377)   apply C, C, and E liberally and they too could return to the source. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=383)   Then the officer reappeared, but no longer wanted to arrest the man and instead wanted 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=390)   to ask him more about his source. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=393)   The officer seemed like a different man, Bob, and told us all to have some compassion and 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=401)   to love deeply and act effectively, which, coming from a cop, is quite something to hear. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=410)   Then the officer and the man conferred, after which the officer bowed to him. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=415)   I kid you not, Bob, you simply cannot make this stuff up. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=421)   And then the Big Shin turned to the crowd and said, and this is a direct quote, On the 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=429)   epitaph of civilization will be that subtle emotional sensations that went undetected 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=439)   did them in. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=440)   But we could do something about that and feel in with clarity, equanimity, and concentration, 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=449)   noting activity and rest and also vibration. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=454)   And by having a complete experience of this, we could find true freedom and fulfilling 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=462)   bliss and be patient. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=465)   It takes time and know that the first bite of emptiness is like biting into an apple. 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=472)   That's right. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=473)   The taste and texture of the skin is not what's inside. 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=477)   And no matter how long it takes, it's worth the ride. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=483)   And all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=489)   If we appreciate, transcend, and in positivity dwell. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=496)   And in the meantime, be a mensch and just think of that inside the jewel in the lotus 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=504)   is love. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=509)   And on that note, he expanded and contracted until he too disappeared. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=515)   And the crowd now the audience just stood there. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=518)   It was weird because we were all quite confused, but also happy and felt good from this strange 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=529)   little man at the edge of the woods. 
<br>[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=533)   And I realized that I'm now talking in rhyme. 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=538)   And I trust Bob that this too will pass with time. 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=542)   So this is Melanie Mash signing out from this event. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz59_PQXpTo&t=546)   It was odd and bizarre, but we all leave content. 
<br>
