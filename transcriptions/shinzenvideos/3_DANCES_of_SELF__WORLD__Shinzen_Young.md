<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=0)   So what we have here is a summary of self and world as three dances plus a still point. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=21)   There's the dance of our humanity, which is our three jobs. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=27)   Create self and world, get over the self and world, improve the self and world. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=34)   Our tools for doing those jobs are our attentional skills, concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=44)   Those skills are applied to and cultivated within our visual, auditory, and somatic sensory 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=53)   experience. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=55)   Here we have the dance of nature from the expansion, contraction, interplay implied 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=66)   by Planck's constant at the very small level of things. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=73)   This is the Friedman equation of cosmic density, which is the interplay of expansive matter 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=88)   energy and contracted matter energy that determine the ultimate size and shape of the universe 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=94)   and so forth. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=96)   This stands for numerous structures in between the largest and the smallest that can be looked 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=105)   upon as having expansive, contractive interplay, like a star is formed by the interplay of 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=115)   the outwardly directed photon pressure from the heat and the inwardly directed force of 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=123)   self-gravity. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=124)   There are numerous scales. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=127)   We see this. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=130)   This is the dance of expansion, contraction, contrast within the material world or nature. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=139)   That's reflected by mutually cancelling polarities within the mathematics of the complex number 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=149)   field, which allows for addition. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=157)   Scaling, which is multiplication by a real number, and twirling, which is imaginary exponentiation 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=169)   or phaser. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=171)   This is the stretch-squeeze aspect of generalized multiplication. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=176)   This is the turn to the right, turn to the left, what's called a phaser, phaser aspect 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=183)   of multiplication, which is the twirling. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=189)   This is like a dancer that moves forward, moves backwards, stretches out, pulls in, 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=196)   twirls to the right, twirls to the left. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=199)   We have this abstract dance of the numbers, and we have the dance of nature itself, time, 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=213)   space, matter, and energy. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=218)   Then we have our senses and our sensory attention skills, which allow us to do the human dance. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=232)   This was... 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=233)   And in the center. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=234)   In the center is the still point of the turning world, which is the source of all of it. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=247)   This is a way of summarizing, in a modern way, what I would characterize as the Pythagorean 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=260)   agenda. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=261)   Pythagoras had this revolutionary idea. 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=265)   He lived around the same time that the Buddha did. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=269)   I could be off by a century or so, but roughly, 5th, 6th century BC, that kind of thing. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=278)   This revolutionary idea that the endeavor of the human soul and the nature of nature 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=293)   and the nature of number were a single unity. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=302)   This is a modern way to think about vindicating the Pythagorean agenda. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=320)   Down here, it's three dances. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=327)   What's sort of cool is that the Pythagoreans were often represented by the pentagram, the 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=338)   five-pointed star. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=340)   That's where this all comes from. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=348)   This is homage to my ancestors, the Israelites. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=356)   So we have the Greeks and the Semites. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=365)   All these three dances. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=368)   Three dances. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=370)   At the still point of the turning world, neither movement from nor towards, at the still point, 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=382)   there the dance is. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=384)   But do not call it fixity, where past and future are gathered. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr848hdW3C0&t=391)   If not for the point, the still point, there would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
