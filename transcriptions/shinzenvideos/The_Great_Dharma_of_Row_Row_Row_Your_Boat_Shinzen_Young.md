title: "The Great Dharma of 'Row Row Row Your Boat' ~Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=0)   This was fantastic. I love this. 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=7)   What's your take on this kitty-ditty? 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=12)   Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=15)   Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=19)   I learned it in my earliest school years, 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=22)   but I can't get it out of my mind. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=24)   Do you suppose that my elementary teachers 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=27)   might have been latent Buddhists? 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=31)   So what that is, is that's the wisdom function within you. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=37)   Seeing in popular literature the deeper dharma meaning. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=43)   That's really good. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=46)   They once did, I suppose it's actually been done a lot of times, 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=58)   but I know of one study that was done by a colleague of mine 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=63)   at Harvard Medical School many years ago, 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=66)   where they gave Rorschach tests to a bunch of mindfulness meditators. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=77)   You know about this study, Dan Brown. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=80)   Not the Dan Brown that wrote the Da Vinci Code. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=83)   The Buddhist Dan. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=85)   It's a different person. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=87)   So what they did is, it's like, 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=91)   okay, let's do psychometrics on monks. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=96)   You know, Southeast Asian, I guess it was Southeast Asian monks. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=100)   I don't remember the cohort specifically. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=103)   And they were graded by years of experience. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=106)   And there were a couple of them that were reputedly enlightened. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=113)   Okay, that were real senior adepts. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=117)   And what they found was that the senior adepts did something with the Rorschach 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=123)   that had never been recorded in the entire history of Rorschach. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=128)   And lots of people have taken these. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=130)   It's the inkblot test, right? 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=132)   You know what it is. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=133)   You've probably taken it. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=134)   Certainly seen it on TV. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=136)   So what they found among the reputed arhats was that 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=144)   what had never been recorded previously is, 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=148)   not only did every inkblot appear to contain some Dharma principle, 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=157)   but the sequence of inkblots, no matter how they presented the sequence, 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=165)   became a coherent sequence of Dharma talks. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=172)   So they concluded that something really major had changed 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=177)   the way that these people see the world. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=179)   Okay, it's like everything is the Dharma. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=183)   You know, a Marvel comic book is the Dharma. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=190)   So row, row, row your boat, it's absolutely the secret of enlightenment. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=196)   It's right in there. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=197)   It's obvious. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=200)   You're right. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=201)   They were crypto Buddhists, every single one of them. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=206)   Or maybe we're just seeing it in a certain way. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=210)   You can take your choice. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=212)   So what is this song about? 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=215)   What does my Dharma eye see in this song? 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=218)   Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream, 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=220)   merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=223)   So what's the stream? 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=226)   Well, that's sort of interesting. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=230)   The Buddha said that what we're doing is patisottagamini-madga, 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=243)   that we are on the path that is against the stream. 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=251)   That's where the name of the group comes from, against the stream. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=255)   Okay? 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=256)   But patisotta, pati is against, sotta is the stream. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=261)   So what does it mean? 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=263)   It means what we do is against the stream of human culture. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=268)   Human culture tends to encourage people to put all of their time and energy 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=278)   into surface or conditional happiness 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=283)   and never talks about the skill set associated with total happiness, 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=289)   which would include, of course, the deeper or unconditional happiness. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=293)   So even 2,500 years ago, even in the society of India 2,500 years ago, 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=300)   as far as the Buddha was concerned, 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=302)   the society was pushing people in the other direction. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=309)   So in that sense, we're going against the stream of human culture 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=313)   because the human culture, you know, if you learn how to control, 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=318)   if you learn the skill of controlling some strings on a musical instrument 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=323)   called a guitar, or you learn the skill of controlling 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=332)   an elastic inflated sphere called a basketball, 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=337)   millions and millions of dollars and adulation and celebrity and, you know, 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=346)   celebrity sex, it all becomes available to you 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=351)   as the result of cultivating those skills. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=355)   So I'll take it in a second. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=357)   So how—but, you know, is there—are there—there's sports awards, 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=362)   there's academy awards, but, you know, did you see anybody get the award 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=370)   for the greatest manifestation of equanimity this year? 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=376)   Or the longest strong determination set? 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=380)   That's a subcategory, the longest strong determination set by a non-Asian. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=385)   You didn't see those awards, so in a sense we're against the stream, yes. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=392)   Did you say that culture teaches us to go downstream? 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=397)   No, well, I'm actually making a contrast, okay? 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=401)   I'm saying that— 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=402)   Okay, you're saying that culture teaches us to go—struggle to go downstream. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=406)   Well, we can make different metaphors. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=409)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=410)   I'm going to make one just for the fun of it. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=412)   So the Buddha said we go against the stream, 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=414)   but this song says go with the stream, right? 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=417)   Merrily, merrily, merrily row your boat, gently down the stream. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=421)   So what's—if we want to make this a Dharma song, 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=425)   then we have to find another stream. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=429)   The stream of human culture, according to the Buddha, 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=432)   we have to go against that stream. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=434)   But is there a stream that we go with, that we go down, when we're on this path? 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=441)   And I would say that is the stream of nature. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=445)   That—enlightenment is just waiting to happen. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=450)   It's implied, actually, in the Buddha's formulation. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=455)   The Buddha said the Eightfold Path is an intervention 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=461)   that removes a necessary condition for non-perfection, 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=467)   implying that the perfection is just waiting to happen. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=471)   All you got to do is knock out what's getting in the way. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=475)   So when I said that, it is possible that the spontaneity aspect 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=480)   that the masters speak about may be that they're tasting entropy. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=485)   Well, entropy is the force behind all spontaneous— 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=489)   well, maybe not all, but— 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=493)   I'm not a physical chemist, but it's the force behind spontaneous reactions. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=501)   When things just happen, they happen because of entropy. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=506)   For example, do you ever wonder why it is if you stretch a rubber band, 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=511)   all you have to do is let go, and it shrinks? 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=515)   Well, it's because the rubber is made of a lot of different strands. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=522)   It's a polymer. 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=524)   And when you stretch it, what you do is you impart an order to those strands, 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=531)   which goes—and as soon as you let go, it goes back to the disordered state. 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=538)   That actually creates a force. 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=540)   The spontaneity, the just-happeningness, 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=543)   when you let go of the rubber band, there is a just-happeningness to its shrinking. 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=551)   That's the taste of entropy. 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=554)   It just happens. It goes right down the stream. It falls into existence. 
<br>[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=558)   So I think that the stream in this dharma song is the natural— 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=566)   is the force of nature itself that is constantly calling us to enlightenment. 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=571)   Now, you could take a Christian perspective, 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=574)   because they say that God's always calling you, vocation, okay? 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=579)   Whether you can hear the call or not. 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=581)   So I think let's take that to be the stream, 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=584)   and of course, merrily, merrily, means that you— 
<br>[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=586)   that's the happy that I claimed is the one word that describes everything. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=591)   Life is but a dream. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=593)   That means featherlight and paper thin, 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=600)   which is insight into impermanence and emptiness. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=604)   But you know, the interesting thing is it encourages you to row your boat 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=609)   in addition to just go down the stream. 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=612)   So when you row the boat, you are exercising control through the oar. 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=621)   So do you know what the— 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=629)   why should you know? What a stupid question. 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=634)   What's the Greek word for someone who rows or control— 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=640)   who steers the boat? 
<br>[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=643)   The Greek word. Well, you will recognize it because it's in English, 
<br>[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=647)   but the person that controls the boat is called the kubernetes. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=653)   That's what's given us the word cybernetics. 
<br>[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=656)   It also has given us the word governor, like in the Watt governor.

<br>[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=667)   Okay, it's a controller, it's a governor, engineering-wise. 
<br>[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=671)   So the encouragement to row your boat, I would take to mean, yes, 
<br>[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=677)   and also in addition to flowing down the stream of enlightenment, 
<br>[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=683)   exercise control with regards to how you carry yourself in the world. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=691)   So the entire dharma, you're absolutely correct.

<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv7WoKwxu5A&t=705)   Thank you.
