title: "Shinzen Guides Steph in 'Focus Out' (Sight, Sound, Touch)~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=0)   The focusing out sounds interesting, so does the positive, but I think the focusing out 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=10)   sounds very interesting. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=12)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=13)   So you'll remember I said that we would very carefully define terms. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=18)   So external sounds we'll call sound. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=25)   External sights we'll call sight. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=28)   And then physical sensations in your body we'll call touch. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=33)   So I'm going to describe a technique and I want you to tell me if it makes sense. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=38)   If all you're aware of is touch, I'd like you to say out loud touch and focus on that 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=44)   for a second. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=45)   We'll call that noting. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=47)   If all you're aware of is touch, note touch. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=49)   If all you're aware of is sight, note sight. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=52)   If all you're aware of is sound, note sound. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=54)   If more than one is available, just choose one to note. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=58)   Intently focus on that for a few seconds and then note again either the same thing or something 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=69)   else. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=70)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=71)   Are my eyes supposed to be open? 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=72)   They will be in a minute. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=73)   Oh, okay. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=74)   So when you say sight you mean with the eyes open. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=77)   But I wanted you to prepare with your eyes closed just to get settled. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=81)   So let me just repeat. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=82)   When I focus on touch I'm focusing on body sensations like sitting in the chair or clothes 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=90)   or just any sensation that's not emotional and that's touch. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=95)   Sight would be what I see with my eyes open and sound is sound. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=100)   That's correct. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=101)   Okay. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=102)   Now what's going to pull you away from touch, sight, sound is your reactions to it which 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=106)   is feel, image, talk. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=108)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=109)   Yes. 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=110)   Or my thoughts. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=111)   Yes. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=112)   Feel, image, talk could take the form of reaction to touch, sight, sound or it could go off 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=118)   on its own and spin memory, plan, and fantasy. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=123)   So you'll be constantly pulled towards feel, image, talk. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=130)   When that happens just let go of that and focus on touch, sight, sound. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=135)   It's sort of expansive concentration. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=138)   The contractive world of thought and emotion pulls in and you work against that expanding 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=145)   out into touch, sight, sound. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=146)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=147)   So by expanding out you mean I'm moving what I'm aware of to the outside world? 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=154)   Yes. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=155)   And you're letting go of the inside world. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=156)   That's good. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=157)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=158)   Right. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=159)   So you're like anchoring yourself in the power of now. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=165)   The touches, the sights, and the sounds are always now. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=168)   So that will weaken the gripping power of fantasy, memory, planning, and judgmentalness. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=177)   So we're going to start to make it simple. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=182)   I'm going to have you just do touch and sound for a second and then we'll add sight. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=188)   So I'd like you to say those labels out loud. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=194)   Just when my awareness is on it I'm like... 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=196)   That's correct. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=197)   Okay. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=198)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=199)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=200)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=201)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=202)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=203)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=204)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=205)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=206)   Sound. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=207)   Sound. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=208)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=209)   Touch. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=210)   That's perfect. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=211)   Meaning the tone of voice, the pacing, and the wording. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=212)   That's exactly how to do it. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=213)   And I'm aware of both at the same time but I'm just picking the one. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=226)   You're selectively trying to pour your attention on just one. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=232)   That's the divide and conquer, one thing at a time kind of thing. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=236)   Okay good. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=237)   Now we're going to up the ante. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=238)   Open your eyes and include sight. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=243)   Let your eyes just do whatever they want to do. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=246)   And now you're going to have three possible things. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=249)   Okay. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=250)   Well, sight is big. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=254)   So I'm just adding sight. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=255)   Just add that but touches and sounds may pull you in also. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=262)   Sight. 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=265)   Sight. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=268)   Touch. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=271)   Sound. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=274)   Sight. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=277)   Sight. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=280)   Sound. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=283)   That's perfect. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=284)   Instead of saying the words out loud, do it mentally. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=290)   So you're just going to think the labels touch, sight, sound. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=319)   You're able to do that pretty good. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=339)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=340)   It takes all... 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=342)   There's not room to do anything else. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=344)   It takes all your concentration just to do it. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=348)   So I think you could see potentially this would pull you out of obsessive thoughts. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=353)   There's no room for obsessive thoughts. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=355)   And you can also see that you could do this in motion while you... 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=360)   You could be moving housework, even when you get good at it, talking to people. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=366)   And you could still... 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=367)   I'm doing it now as I'm talking to you. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=369)   You're going to... 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=370)   Sight. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=371)   And then you can think of what to say. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=372)   No, I don't... 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=374)   We didn't get into it, but remember I said base level of concentration, clarity? 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=379)   Eventually it just goes on autopilot. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=381)   I'm doing it now without having to make even the mental labels, but I'm aware. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=386)   Is it touch, sight, sound that I'm focusing on? 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=388)   I'm trying to do it too. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=391)   So that allows you... 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=392)   And I think you can see it builds... 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=394)   You feel like you're more focused, right? 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=397)   That's the concentration piece. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=398)   It's interesting. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=399)   My whole sense of being here, I realize how much my sense of who I am is really... 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=404)   You know, oh, that voice in my head that's telling me where to go and you're going to 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=408)   be late, or... 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=409)   It's all in here and kind of focused here. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=411)   And there's something about this that makes my whole sense of what I am bigger. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=417)   As my awareness moves out there, and like I said, it doesn't leave room for my chatter, 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=425)   my incessant chatter in my head. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=427)   It takes a break. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=428)   I'm not aware of it until afterwards. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=431)   And obviously it's activated now again as I talk, but... 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=435)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=436)   That's the general idea. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=437)   Great. 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsxY7DI06g&t=438)   There you go. 
<br>
