title: "Direct Awakening Exercise ~ LOCH KELLY with Stephanie Nash"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=0)   Well, each exercise kind of takes you directly. 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=10)   So let's give me an example. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=12)   Let's just have an example of one of these exercises, one of them, or one of the ones 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=16)   where you use something physical. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=20)   Not the thought ones. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=21)   Okay. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=22)   All right. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=23)   All right. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=24)   So here's, yeah. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=26)   So one simple way of getting this feeling of shifting your awareness out of the identification 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=37)   with your mind, which creates this little self-looping identity, is to have awareness 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=45)   just, again, I'm talking to you, the awareness. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=50)   I'm talking to you, the awareness, and the awake awareness. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=53)   So if you think, well, how am I going to unhook awareness from thought? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=57)   I've never done that. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=58)   I don't know if I can do that. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=59)   That is correct. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=60)   You cannot do it. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=62)   But awareness can do it. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=64)   So you just have to be, sometimes I call it the Columbo approach. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=67)   It's like, yeah. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=68)   Oh, by the way, before I leave, I just unhook awareness and have it drop. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=75)   By the way, as an aside. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=76)   As an aside, just without thinking about it. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=77)   Do that, and then. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=78)   And then you'll be awake. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=79)   So we'll see you next time. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=80)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=81)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=82)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=83)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=84)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=85)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=86)   So just simply have awareness, which is identified or attached to thought. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=90)   Simply unhook and step back, and then see what it feels like if awareness, which is 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=95)   the center of knowing, drops and knows your smile from within your smile, knows your jaw 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=102)   from within your jaw, without looking up to thought and without stretching or looking 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=107)   down from thought, have awareness that knows directly drop into your throat, know your 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=114)   throat from within, and then feel awareness drop below your neck and feel your upper torso 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=122)   or come into your heart space. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=124)   And you can smile and breathe and just feel what it's like to directly perceive your body 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=135)   from within without orienting to thought and without going to sleep. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=142)   This field is a direct awareness-based, embodied, open-hearted, non-thought-based knowing, which 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=158)   is kind of alert. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=160)   It's aware of space, it's aware of aliveness, and it's aware of awareness, which is aware 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=170)   by itself. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=176)   Just feel that relief and notice this new, non-conceptual, embodied way of shifting into 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=191)   another dimension of your consciousness. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=198)   See what's absent, what was there, and then see the qualities of presence that start to 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=208)   kind of shimmer. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=212)   What do you notice? 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=223)   What I love about that is not checking up. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=233)   You say looking up? 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=234)   Yeah, not looking up. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=235)   I'm not looking up and I'm not down here going, oh look, that's happening there. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=240)   I'm not this witness watching this, which is what we do a lot. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=244)   Like okay, I feel my knee and now I'm labeling here. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=249)   But you literally talk about being there. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=254)   And for me that's like juicy. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=256)   It's like, oh, it's nice. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=262)   It's full, it's nice, it's warm, there's love. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=267)   And the not looking up, looking down is free, because you realize it's kind of like the 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=276)   Wizard of Oz is behind there trying to move all the gears to make that thing work. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=281)   And it's like he's not there anymore. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=283)   And so you can just allow it to be something without all the, well, you know, stuff there 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=292)   and that's nice. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=294)   And then just take us out. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=296)   Yeah, so take us out. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=300)   So then interestingly, there's a bunch of different ways, kind of like you taught, I'm 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=307)   aware of different learning types. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=309)   So some people are kinesthetic, some people are emotional, some people are more mental, 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=314)   some people are visual, some people are auditory. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=317)   So I use different doors for, and some people were like, oh, that one was really good and 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=324)   that one didn't work so well. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=326)   But by the time we do short little practices. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=329)   And does everything, something's going to start a movement. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=331)   Something's starting to happen and they get to the same place. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=335)   And then interestingly, they use their own words to describe it. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=339)   And they don't need to use the vocabulary that I'm starting with. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=343)   And that's the style of his teaching. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=346)   He'll kind of guide you to an experience. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=348)   And then literally, rather than talking about it, he has everyone go around the room and 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=353)   report their words. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=354)   And what's nice always about that is, one, as a student, you get to hear what everyone 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=362)   else is doing. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=363)   Not that I'll have some of that or what he is, but it helps open your idea to other things 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=369)   that can be, or maybe it was words you hadn't thought to describe it from your own experience. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=374)   As the teacher sitting there, I was going, way to go. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=377)   You know, like, you hear that? 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=379)   You hear all that? 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=380)   So good, it's so good. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=381)   I was like, there's popcorn happening in this room. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=384)   And throughout the workshop, you'd hear someone at the beginning going, where is what? 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=390)   You'd hear them at the beginning and at the end, there were a couple people at the end 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=393)   going, oh, and you get these ahas. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=396)   And as a teacher, I was high-fiving him and going, that is so cool. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=401)   Because as a teacher, the mudita, you get this joy at that. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=408)   Because you know they walked out the door with something that's going to shift their 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=412)   life in a good way. 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=414)   And they're giving them tools to be able to do it themselves. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=417)   So there's like, these short practices and I've written this book about it. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=424)   Oh yeah, your book. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=426)   I almost forgot. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=428)   There's a book. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=429)   You want a book on this? 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=432)   There's a book on this. 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=433)   What's your book called? 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=434)   It's a book on this. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=435)   Shift Into Freedom. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=436)   It's called Science and Practice of Open-Hearted Awareness. 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=439)   All right, got that. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=441)   Shift Into Freedom. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=442)   And then currently there's an audio. 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=446)   And it's a very perfect title for what this is too. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=449)   It is exactly a shift into freedom. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=451)   And there's an audio? 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=452)   Yeah, and the audio currently is the audio of the practices, not the audio of the book. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=457)   Oh, you didn't want to sit there for 12 hours and read your book? 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=461)   I ended up doing that and that will come out. 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=463)   Oh, okay. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=465)   I always like to hear the teacher, like I want to hear Pema Chodron read her book. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=470)   I want to hear the word, I don't want the actor they hired. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=474)   I want to hear you describe it, because you also get that kind of, the energy of how it 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=479)   comes in. 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=480)   So when you say it's the audio of just the practices. 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=482)   So the audio of the practices is kind of the teaching style, is like the teacher, it's 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=488)   like I'm introducing the students to their own inner teacher. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=494)   And when I'm showing or pointing them to look within, it's not look up here, but look back 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=502)   within you. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=503)   And then once you discover this non-conceptual awareness, by being able to speak from there, 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=510)   it's really not even about the words. 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=513)   It's about speaking from non-conceptual heart mind, so that you start to rewire functioning 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=522)   and living from this new way of knowing and being, so that you can start to make it a 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=529)   normal thing. 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=530)   And then in the middle of your life, you can start to just walk down the street, go to 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=535)   work, have relationships, hang out, have fun. 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=539)   From a continuous awakening, you know, losing it. 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=543)   And part of the small glimpses is, of course, initially, you're going to recognize, realize 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=549)   and lose it, and then the practice is re-recognize. 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=554)   So training to re-recognize and return and remain and then speak and walk and talk from 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=562)   there and then lose it. 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=564)   And then no big surprise, just re-recognize. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=567)   And then again, and the training can be done with these small glimpses in the midst of 
<br>[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8w4PYwtxc&t=572)   your day. 
<br>
