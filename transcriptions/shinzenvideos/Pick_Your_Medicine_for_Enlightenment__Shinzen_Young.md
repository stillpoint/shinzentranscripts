<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=0)   We were talking yesterday about how much I like this springy icon because it shows what 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=26)   we sit on always or where our feet are planted always whether we're aware of it or not, which 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=33)   is the spring of the air, the vibrancy of emptiness. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=45)   To experience that in our inner and outer see, hear, feel and to ride on that in how 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=57)   we express ourselves in body motion, speech, and the voluntary parts of the thinking process, 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=71)   our triple karma, so to speak, our actions, our motor circuits, to experience the flow 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=80)   of emptiness in our sensory circuits and to express that very same spirit in the bounciness 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=90)   and spontaneity of our motor circuits. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=95)   This is the paradigm that I like to use for how this path works. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=103)   I mentioned that around the world there are numerous ways and throughout history numerous 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=115)   fundamental ways have been discovered to come to this. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=122)   You can deconstruct things through careful observation. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=125)   I like that because I can turn it into a systematic algorithm that loops and branches. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=132)   There's in theory the possibility of nurture positive as a path to that, particularly as 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=142)   it's done in the Vajrayana traditions, the deity yoga, where you eventually learn how 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=148)   to manifest the deities from the void. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=153)   At the end of the period of the deity yoga, the period of the deity yoga is called the 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=159)   cherim, which means the stages of generation. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=164)   Then that's followed by dzogren, where it's all dissolved back into the emptiness. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=175)   Often they will use special physiological yogic practices to facilitate getting the 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=183)   emptiness down into the cellular level of one's being, like the six dharmas of Naropa 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=190)   and so forth, if you're interested. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=194)   Versions of nurture positive can achieve this, at least in theory. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=198)   There's the whole, okay, do nothing approach, just call off the search. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=206)   Then there's the sort of be conscious of consciousness, self-inquiry, shine the light back on itself, 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=217)   who am I, what am I kinds of approaches. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=222)   I think those are sort of the four main, highly contrasting strategies that we find around 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=231)   the world. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=232)   I encourage people to do what works. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=234)   Different things work for different people at different times. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=238)   I'm a little bit averse to people that claim there's only one way that is stunningly better 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=246)   for all human beings, that has just not been my experience. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=253)   Different things seem to work for different people at different times. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=259)   So pick your medicine. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=267)   And hopefully, if you keep with it, it will gradually converge or maybe suddenly converge 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=276)   to this kind of bouncy experience of, you can call it liberation, you can call it unification, 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=287)   you can call it annihilation, or you can call it creation. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=297)   It's my version of creationism, okay. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=301)   My version of creationism is that you see how consciousness creates the inner and outer 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=311)   world moment by moment and you participate in that. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=316)   So form is emptiness, that's sort of the first part of the process. 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=323)   And then emptiness is form, is another theme that presents itself as you begin to be able 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=336)   to sort of enjoy seeing the world manifest and the self manifest moment by moment, continuous 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=348)   creation. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=349)   Bri'ah yesh me'ayin in the Hebrew, the Bri'ah, the creation, yesh means both self and thing, 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=361)   the creation of self and thing, met from ayin, the divine nothingness. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=368)   So I left off by saying that in the Jewish mystical tradition, the ability to do that 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=380)   is related to an important theme called tikkun olam, the mending of the world, which of course 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=386)   is none other than the bodhisattva service. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=392)   So 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=393)   if you've watched a festival, then you would in no way wrong to be over on that. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=399)   I mix with it a bit and people would comment that you know what, I communities with an 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=407)   overdone Irish people, and you found that you're misbehaving, misbehaving, but still 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=413)   doing misbehaving, from what I know from prison as well, there normally won't be gang 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ-MTC6NcAk&t=417)   relations, but missing one member, the priest of the church from Pas JJ, they were like
