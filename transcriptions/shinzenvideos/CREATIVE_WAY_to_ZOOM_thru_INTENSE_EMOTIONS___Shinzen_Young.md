<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=0)   Now you know how in a, like in a ghost movie, you see that like the ghost can walk through 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=21)   the wall, right? 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=22)   Right. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=23)   The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=29)   Now imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=35)   both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=42)   each other when they occupied the same place at the same time. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=49)   So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavor 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=55)   sad, and they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=62)   of them can occupy the same place. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=67)   So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=74)   each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=80)   Does this metaphor make sense? 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=83)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=84)   Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=88)   Not in this, not this round. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=90)   This may be the part of the missing piece because you could get them individually to 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=96)   flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow because if they both flow at the same 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=102)   time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without interfering, then they won't multiply 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=111)   together into overwhelm. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=115)   So the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=122)   flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=129)   that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=140)   body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=146)   Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=150)   It's an interesting, it's an interesting intimacy between them. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=157)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=158)   It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=163)   And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=170)   purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=194)   Right. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=241)   How's that coming? 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=243)   Good. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=245)   Good. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=247)   Good in what sense? 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=249)   When I can allow them both to share the same space and not... 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=258)   and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=263)   and keeping that line between them 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=265)   and when I allow them to just kind of do that... 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=269)   The kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=273)   it's a very intense version of that 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=276)   and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind of PT-like energy up the body 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=281)   and it gets very hot. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=283)   So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=289)   Yes, I am. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=291)   This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive, 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=295)   but your facial expression proves it. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=298)   Yes. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=299)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=300)   It's really interesting though because as it does, 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=302)   I find myself wanting to comment on it and I'll go off and talk 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=306)   and then it loses it a little bit. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=310)   Yes, and you have to come back. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=312)   It's got to be done purely in the body. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=314)   Yes. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=315)   Because the comments and then... 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=318)   It does trigger some little topics to go, 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=321)   but this is all about it. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=322)   That's right, but your use of practice allows you to stop that 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=325)   and not sort of go down in that. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=328)   Yes, plus there's motivation to kind of stay with this. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=332)   It's intrinsically rewarding. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=334)   Now, next step, see if you can have the fear and the sadness 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=340)   dancing with and through each other with your eyes open. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=345)   And you may find defocusing the eyes initially helpful. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=353)   So we can maintain it somewhat into a more ordinary experience. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=359)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=368)   It's interesting when I am, as I kind of go in and out here as I do it, 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=373)   and I'm going to talk while keeping my eyes open, 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=375)   but I'm getting to where I'm honing in on the one specific place in the body 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=382)   they both share in a powerful way. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=385)   And if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=388)   letting it be, whether it's the red or blue, you know, 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=393)   it kind of helps me maintain it with my eyes open more. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0myTye_QSU&t=397)   Good.
