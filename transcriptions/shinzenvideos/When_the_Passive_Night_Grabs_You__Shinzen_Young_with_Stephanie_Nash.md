title: "When the 'Passive Night' Grabs You ~ Shinzen Young with Stephanie Nash"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=0)   There's a way of resting in the source that, like I say, yeah, it's going to take a lot 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=16)   of work, but I see how that softens into a big smile based on what's happening during 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=30)   the sits now. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=33)   You know, when I'm sitting here and I'm seeing my physiology like really, really slowing 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=40)   down and say, oh, OK, this is getting close to a petit mort, little death. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=53)   Something like that. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=54)   OK, thank you. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=55)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=56)   Hard to put into words. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=59)   It's like that line from Casablanca, you know, Louis, just like any other man, only more 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=64)   so. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=65)   All right. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=66)   We have just enough time, Stephanie. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=70)   You want more details on your own and as Lama? 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=74)   No, I don't. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=78)   But thank you. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=80)   Although what I'm asking may relate to what you just said. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=85)   This is a question. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=87)   It's a report of an experience and a hypothesis I have about it. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=92)   But I'd like your feedback. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=93)   It's about processing emotions and possibly different flavors of equanimity. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=100)   Not sure the practice I've been doing a lot on this retreat. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=105)   I've been doing a lot of practices, but one is turning back, coming from the perspective 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=110)   of awareness. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=112)   And I find myself saying this phrase like, oh, seeing is happening. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=117)   Hearing is happening. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=118)   You know, and I'm not saying the phrase to get it. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=121)   That just kind of comes out when I kind of shift there. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=125)   And then I've noticed a change of strategy for emotions. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=129)   Then normally when emotions happen, my MO is to turn towards them and surrender and 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=135)   let it all flow. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=136)   And if it's really intense, I do expansion, contraction, because it's like a slingshot 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=140)   to sensation. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=141)   You know, and I think of that like, well, I'll save that. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=153)   But now what happens when I'm coming from the place of awareness into the emotion, as 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=160)   opposed to me participating and opening and allowing and having this clarity, it's almost 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=168)   like I'm coming from this place of a calmness, a stillness, a kind of silent vastness. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=175)   And it's like, I'm just waiting for this thought or feeling to reveal its emptiness. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=186)   Or I was doing that, and then I thought, oh, let me just watch expansion and contraction 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=191)   in it and let it dissolve. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=193)   And I think those might be the same thing. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=195)   And the word that keeps coming out of my head when I'm doing this is, oh, it's not real. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=200)   Oh, it's not real. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=201)   It's all empty. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=202)   It's all empty. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=203)   And so I was wondering, as I'm doing this and feeling the stickiness be less sticky, 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=212)   is this, is that a different flavor of equanimity? 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=215)   Am I dissolving the craving at a deeper level? 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=220)   I do believe both involve a kind of radical equanimity, but the first one feels like it 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=226)   has more of my participation in it. 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=229)   And the second one is almost identifying there's not a problem in the first place. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=234)   So I just wanted to know if you could talk about that a little bit. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=240)   Actually this is going to be one of those questions that has a pretty short and I hope 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=245)   actually a spot on answer. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=250)   Maybe I can do it in one. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=255)   One finger's in. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=256)   All right. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=257)   Yes, Choshin's trying to pass her koan. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=268)   Okay, so the general vibe I get from your report, the overall report, what pops into 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=281)   my head is figure ground reversal that you hear me talk about. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=289)   That at some point you go from God is a fantasy inside a material world to the material world 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=306)   is a fantasy inside God. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=309)   That's a figure ground reversal. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=312)   And it sounds to me like you're being taken down that path, which is very good. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=320)   It's taking... 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=323)   Well, it's taking you. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=330)   You're moving into what the Catholics used to call the passive night as opposed to the 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=339)   active night, the dark two sides. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=343)   This is the passive night. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=345)   It's taking you more and more. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=349)   And the deeper it takes you, the more effortlessly animated you become when it gives back space 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=365)   time for your existence. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=370)   So that's what I heard. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=375)   You're moving towards that shift, and that's an important shift. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=383)   That's the authentic person without a fixated center, right? 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=391)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=393)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=395)   Thank you for that clear but short answer. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=398)   Well, thank all of you for the wonderful work and the wonderful interactions. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=405)   It's a mihaya, as we say in the language of my people. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=410)   That means a joy that gives you chai, it gives you life. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=416)   So I think we're good. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiuAAV52fEQ&t=419)   And see you, I guess, in the Zendo next.
