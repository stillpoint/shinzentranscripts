title: "The Use of 'Woo Woo' Words by Enlightened Masters ~Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=0)   Yeah, you know, the woo-woo words, they can help and they can really get in the way. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=18)   And sometimes I get a little cynical and think the woo-woo words are used to join students who will keep paying their dues. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=26)   Well, I suspect that there are, there's a range of motivations among teachers. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=35)   I'll give you some inside information on teachers, okay. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=39)   Teachers have a range of motivations. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=44)   And yeah, sometimes it's to, you know, make sure the Donna stream is maintained. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=53)   And, but I used to be extremely cynical and rude about all of this stuff when I started. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=63)   Because I basically, you know, I just thought it was BS, you know, early, very early on when I was a kid and I was just studying this stuff. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=73)   It was cool to read about and I liked it and I liked the Asian languages. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=77)   But I really thought that it was all made up by the monks in order to deceive the faithful. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=86)   I mean, I really thought that. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=90)   And when I went to Asia and I heard great masters speak, I mean, I was privileged. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=96)   I actually like heard people like Yamada Munon, Shibayama Zenkei, maybe these names don't mean much to you. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=104)   But these are the gods of mid-20th century Japanese Zen. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=113)   And they were still alive when I was there, both of them. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=117)   And I could speak and understand Japanese. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=121)   I actually heard these people give talks. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=124)   And I didn't think they were making it up in order to increase the temple revenue. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=137)   But what I did think is they were making it up to blow people's minds. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=142)   To like say really weird stuff. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=146)   It's like, you know, it sort of grabs you. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=150)   So I thought it was like a Zen affectation, like an affected style of presenting things. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=159)   It's just basically it's like, you know, blow people's minds and get people's attention, whatever. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=168)   Now I hear myself saying this. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=176)   I mean, I realize, oh my god, I mean now I know for sure what the motivation in those cases was. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKT0zhN1em8&t=185)   I can't say about the kids, the high school kids, you know, at the gate of the temple that are trying to get your shekels, okay.
