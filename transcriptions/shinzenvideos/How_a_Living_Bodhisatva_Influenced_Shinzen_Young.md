title: "How a Living Bodhisatva Influenced Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=0)   Some of you know, some of you actually knew Nicola Geiger before she passed away. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=14)   So this is a woman that I met in Japan who was German and had lived through World War 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=26)   II as part of the resistance to the Nazis. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=32)   They even made a movie about the group called The White Rose. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=37)   So she had to go, it was like Schindler's List, you know, I mean, she lived it. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=42)   She was only 20 years old at the time. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=45)   And she'd just been through everything. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=47)   I mean, she'd been tortured, interrogated, raped, you name it. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=52)   It had happened many times. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=60)   So I met up with her. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=65)   I didn't know who she was or whatever. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=71)   But she said, well, if you ever come to Kyoto, come visit me. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=77)   She was running Friends World College, which is a Quaker college that has campuses all 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=83)   over the world. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=84)   And she was interestingly engaged, she worked for Amnesty International. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=89)   She was in fact their specialist on human rights violations in South Korea, which at 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=97)   that time was very bad on human rights violations. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=102)   And she was actually like, it was like this, it was very cinematic. 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=110)   I mean, she was engaged in like secret espionage stuff because she was trying to save the life 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=118)   of Kim Dae-jung. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=119)   Now, you may or may not know the whole story, but eventually Kim Dae-jung became the president 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=126)   of South Korea and Korea became democratized. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=130)   But he was in prison at that time. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=133)   And she was doing all sorts of stuff with Amnesty International to make sure that he 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=139)   didn't get killed. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=142)   So she was like, you know, you would think someone that had been through that themselves 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=147)   would want to sort of distance themselves, right? 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=152)   But no. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=153)   Anyway. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=154)   So how this relates to challenges and what have you is, so she says, come visit me if 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=164)   you're ever in Kyoto. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=170)   So I was in Kyoto, I came to visit her. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=173)   And she said, come up to my living room here. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=179)   Sit down. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=181)   Do you know why I invited you to come here? 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=187)   I said, no. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=190)   And then she proceeded to tell me exactly where I was at in meditation and what I needed 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=199)   to do to take the next step. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=203)   That was sort of surprising. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=205)   But then later on, after I knew her story, she had been trained to meditate from the 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=212)   time that she was three years old. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=217)   Her father had been a meditator and they were associated with Hermann Hesse and the League 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=231)   of the Journeyers to the East and this whole group of Europeans that were interested in 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=237)   sort of Buddhist kinds of things during the Weimar Republic. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=243)   Anyway so I mean she'd been trained, that's why she survived all that stuff and prospered. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=250)   She had enlightenment experiences while these horrible things were going on to her. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=259)   So eventually it became evident why she had this perspicacity to see through you, literally. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=270)   So anyway, apropos of challenge, what she pointed out to me was that I didn't like people 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=276)   and that I withdrew from people and that I was going to have to learn to like being around 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=285)   people. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=290)   It was true. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=291)   I had spent my entire life as a loner. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=294)   I was very uncomfortable around people. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=306)   What I have in her was a role model for what she was talking about. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=311)   She was the first role model. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=313)   Later on I had others. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=317)   But what did she do? 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=320)   Well she just hung out in her house and people would come to be with her. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=331)   What kind of people? 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=333)   Every kind of person. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=336)   The entire spectrum of humanity. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=342)   From the best to the worst. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=347)   The best being the Zen masters and Catholic priests. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=354)   She was friends with Father Johnston, for example. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=359)   And the worst being Yakuza, if you know what that is. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=365)   And left wing international terrorists, like the real deal. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=375)   And everything in between would pass through her living room and she would give each one 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=387)   of them what they needed. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=390)   So that was a big change in my habit patterns, that I had to learn to love to be around people 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=397)   and be with people. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2KUFRoBM0M&t=399)   It might not seem like that big a deal, but that was a challenge.
