title: "What if the Cause of Suffering Was Physical?  ~Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=0)   Let's say that there is a necessary cause behind the necessary cause. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=20)   And the necessary cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neurophysiological in 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=27)   nature. Then there could be interventions that directly address that neurophysiological. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=36)   So you knock out the physiological necessary condition for tanha, therefore you knock out 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=43)   tanha, therefore you knock out what blocks perfection. So, potentially, any piece of 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=55)   research into craving, if it were done very deeply, might unlock a key physiological mechanism. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=69)   What I find interesting is that you can't get much funding for research on enlightenment, 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=76)   but you can get funding for research on drug addiction. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=83)   Isn't that funny? 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=85)   But if research on drug addiction were to be done in a way that would be able to 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=95)   go very, very deep and very, very broad, it's possible that the necessary cause for tanha 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=107)   could be found and eliminated. Which would mean, if we take the Buddhist model, that 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=117)   there would be a physiological, and don't ask me what kind, because I don't know. If 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=122)   I did know, I'd get the Nobel Prize. I have no idea. Is it some super kind of biofeedback? 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=129)   Is it fMRI biofeedback? Is it TMS stimulation? Is it what they call DREADS, which sounds 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=137)   bad, but they're like these... 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=139)   Sounds like a hair stand. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=141)   No, it's designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=148)   edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows what, but if there were a way to knock out the necessary 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=155)   cause for the necessary cause, and it was purely physiological, then nirvana would actually 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=161)   simply happen. Now, what I find the delicious notion is that you can get funding for craving 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=172)   research, and you could get funding for deep and broad craving research, and you could 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=177)   get funding from Republicans, gladly, for deep and broad craving research. Therefore, 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=184)   it could come to pass that Republicans become responsible for the entire world of becoming 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdulQzPqRi8&t=195)   Buddhist.
