<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=0)   So what did you say? 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=12)   You said that there's like this thing that it only wants one thing. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=23)   It's like monotonic. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=26)   It knows nothing, it's a force, and it's a command, and it's one command only, and it's 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=35)   be everything. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=38)   And it doesn't respect any normal distinctions that we make, either normal ones that humans 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=46)   make or the ones that we make when we construct the techniques. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=51)   Like, okay, we're going to distinguish visual, auditory, semantic, inner and outer, active, 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=57)   restful. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=58)   This doesn't respect any boundaries. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=63)   All it says is, you could say it a million ways, live, get big, be everything is not 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=72)   bad. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=75)   And there is its complement, it's exactly the same, except it says exactly the opposite. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=83)   It says die, it says get small, it says be nothing. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=89)   And no sooner is one present than the other is present. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=96)   That's what you... 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=98)   You made a certain spatial metaphor of like, okay, you know, you're pushing from this side, 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=105)   it's pulling out from the other side. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=107)   That particular physics metaphor might not be the right metaphor, but it's the right 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=114)   general idea. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=117)   They generate each other. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=126)   A man feels more masculine in the presence of a woman and conversely, they sort of generate 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=133)   their own contrast, right? 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=136)   So you're absolutely correct. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=145)   We represent complementary flavors of nutrition and we're like babies. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=156)   And we want to be... 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=160)   Sometimes we want to be held by daddy, sometimes we want to be held by mommy, sometimes we 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=164)   want to be held by both, sometimes we want to just crawl off on our own. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=169)   But as long as we can know that we can have all of those on demand, then all of our needs 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=178)   are satisfied. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=179)   So this is the adult version of perfect parenting, I guess we'd have to say. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=195)   The adult is now the infant, right? 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=201)   Mommy and daddy are perfect parents from their perspective. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=205)   Now from the baby's perspective, well, that's another story. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=211)   Because most of the babies aren't even aware that they've never lost their cosmic mommy 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=220)   or daddy. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=221)   So you get the sense that they kind of want to tear you apart. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=225)   Like a kid who doesn't understand, like, why do I need to eat? 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=229)   I'm crying, I'm suffering, why are you trying to feed me? 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=232)   It's sort of like, strange. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=234)   Well, it is absolutely the case that expansion and contraction will tear you apart. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=245)   It's like being in the hands of a cosmic pizza chef, just being stretched and pounded. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=254)   And in the process, the lumps get worked out. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=258)   And it does feel like you're being torn apart. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=270)   But then as you get used to it, it feels like the paradigm shifts from the forces of life 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=279)   and death are tearing me apart to I am giving myself back to what I'm giving back what I 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=295)   got from father. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=297)   I'm giving that back to father. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=299)   I'm giving back what I got from mother to mother. 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=308)   So it's Donna, but it's what you originally got from them. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=314)   Everything inside of you that says yes joins the cosmic yes. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=322)   And everything inside of you that says no joins the cosmic no. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=327)   And that's the yes and the no that's big enough to mold this or any conceivable universe. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=338)   And then you become that. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=341)   You become that for a moment or a longer duration depending on practice, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=350)   So at first you think that the forces are tearing you apart. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=358)   I guess we could say there are two basic phobias, claustrophobia and agoraphobia. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=366)   It's too small and it's too big for humankind to bear. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=375)   But then when we get over that phobia, the paradigm shifts from father and mother are 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=381)   tearing me apart to I'm giving myself back to father and mother to I am participating 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=388)   in the activity of father and mother and have everything I could possibly need forever. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTvD7e858CE&t=396)   And we are done.
