<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=0)   Sometimes people say, hey, Shifton, you've got a label for the moment of vanishing, gone. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=12)   What's wrong? 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=13)   Why don't you have a label for the moment of arising? 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=17)   I do. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=18)   I absolutely have a label for the moment of arising that we use in when we do the expanse 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=31)   in contraction flow. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=34)   The moment of arising at a very deep, deep level of understanding. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=41)   The moment of arising is the moment when the space of that experience simultaneously comes 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=49)   into existence and begins going out of existence. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=53)   My label for that is both. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=56)   Both expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=59)   They've pulled apart and they are molding the present moment. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=64)   Both gone. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=65)   Both gone. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=66)   Both gone. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=67)   Both gone. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=68)   You sum up all those boths and gons and you have a giant eternal fountain of youth that 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=76)   is always simultaneously spreading and collapsing and pervaded with the absolute tranquility 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=85)   of a trillion vanishings. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=89)   To the extent that you have become that, that there's been a figure of ground reversing. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=95)   That instead of thinking about that or observing that, you actually participate in that. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=101)   Well, that's an eternal fountain of youth. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=104)   So to that extent, you become that. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=112)   Your personal death is much less of an issue. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=119)   Because by personal death you mean the death of a mind and body. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=125)   But to the extent that you've re-identified with the flow of the source, that's not going 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=132)   to go away. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=134)   So quote you will never go away. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=138)   To that extent. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=139)   And to the extent that there's been a figure of ground reversal and instead of observing 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=145)   it, it's been gone, there's just gone and things come and go from it. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=161)   Well to that extent you won't actually notice the difference between being alive and being 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=169)   dead. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=170)   And as strange as that sounds, that means that you won't have to die. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_0dWhDzNPU&t=179)   Your body and mind will have to pass away, but you won't have to die.
