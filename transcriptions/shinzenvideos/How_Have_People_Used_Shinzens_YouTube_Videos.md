---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=0)   Okay, so I'm going to start off with asking you, since our first interview, which was 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=14)   January of 2009, and we are now in January of 2010, and since then you did all these 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=22)   interviews with Harprakash on YouTube, and you've had two whole YouTube channels now 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=27)   full of videos of Shenzhen out in the world. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=31)   Has this changed anything? 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=32)   Has this affected you in any way, having all this YouTube presence now? 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=36)   It hasn't affected me personally that I'm aware of, but I think what it has done is 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=43)   made a lot of very useful material available to a lot of people, because we seem to be 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=50)   having people using this, and of course we have records of all the usage. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=56)   I would say as far as me personally, the main impact has been I have a lot of very, very 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=62)   pleasant emotional body sensation at the knowledge that, because of the service that a couple 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=70)   of my students have done for me, yourself and Harprakash, now we've got thousands and 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=77)   thousands of people making use of this, and most of what I have to teach is just there 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=85)   in a very organized format, available 24-7, free to the world, Dharma on demand. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=94)   Just gives me pleasant sensations. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=96)   Have you heard of ways in which people may be using the videos that is helpful? 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=102)   I wouldn't have thought of. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=103)   There are actually ways that I wouldn't have thought of. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=106)   I thought people would mostly be using it for conceptual reference occasionally, but 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=113)   apparently people are using it on a consistent basis as a kind of teacher in your home for 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=120)   their day-to-day practice. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=122)   Got a guru in your pocket, and you're just happy to see me. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=125)   There we go. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Fma6yUT0E&t=126)   Cool, cool.
