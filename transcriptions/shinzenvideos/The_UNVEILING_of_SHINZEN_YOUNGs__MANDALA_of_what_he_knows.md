<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=0)   Cool, huh? 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=7)   Wow. 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=10)   Wow. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=12)   Applause. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=17)   Wow. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=20)   It's pretty, isn't it? 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=22)   Beautiful. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=23)   Now, like I say, you can't see the symbols from where you are, even if you have good vision, but I'm going to pass out something that you can look at. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=35)   But here it is. Here is your senses, right? Your conduct, how life treats you, and the answer to the question, what is mindfulness? Concentration, clarity, equanimity. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=56)   Why practice mindfulness? Total human happiness. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=62)   What's involved? How do you practice mindfulness? Techniques? Daily cycle? Yearly cycle? Daily cycle? Have a good time. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=72)   What's the history of mindfulness? Shamanic, prehistoric shamanic origins? Historic meditative traditions? Present research? Possibly dawn of a new age. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=86)   This is the basics. What, why, where, when. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=92)   Now the details. Details on what. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=96)   What is concentration? 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=99)   Well, I've given all the lectures, I'm not going to go into it, but you know, there's what it is, what it isn't. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=105)   Instances, the deep view, and the taste. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=109)   And the same information for sensory clarity. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=112)   And the same information for equanimity. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=115)   Details, notice it lines up one to one. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=118)   Details about this you store here. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=122)   Details about this, there's the noting board. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=126)   There's the focus on positive board, iconographically represented. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=130)   Positive affect is smiling, positive behavior is legs. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=135)   Positive cognition is a brain. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=138)   Ideal or archetype is a holy figure. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=142)   Positive situation is a dawn. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=145)   Similar to this, but, and then this is other, and you can do it in the visual auditory somatic. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=151)   We don't show the do nothing board because it's nothing. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=155)   And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=163)   There's strategies for formal practice. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=166)   There are ways of classifying, cutting up the pie of sensory experience. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=170)   There are ways of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=177)   How can I deal with this? How can I deal with that? 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=180)   You can formulate your strategies, that's your tool kit. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=183)   And also it gives you a detailed view of the history. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=188)   That's a sundial. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=192)   You remember that we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of world contemplation based on these categories. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=199)   So these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=204)   So details about this, details about this. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=211)   What up here? Details about Mr. Happy Head. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=215)   Okay. What's surface happiness? 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=219)   Avoiding pain, getting pleasure, avoiding pain. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=224)   What's deep happiness? 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=226)   Experiencing pleasure times mindfulness. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=230)   And what's, instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain divided by mindfulness, reducing suffering. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=239)   What does the mind want? 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=242)   It wants to shine its light on all these different problems. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=246)   But what does it really want? To shine its light on the socket that it's connected to. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=253)   What you think you want is to avoid don't-know-mind. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=258)   But what you really want is to be able to experience don't-know-mind as an empowerment. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=263)   What you think you want, which is valid, is good situations. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=267)   Sunny weather, not bad weather. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=270)   But what you really want, because it leads to these things, is positive behavior. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=277)   So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=282)   You ask me what's the definition of enlightenment. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=285)   So this is a figure with a smiley face, but the outline is very diffuse. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=290)   There's no separation between inside and outside. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=293)   No thinness to separate. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=296)   And a consequence of that is that you want to serve. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=300)   You want to serve materially. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=302)   You want to serve by, this is a mouth teaching mindfulness, mouth it, okay? 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=308)   You give dana, you support those that serve materially, and you support those who teach. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=315)   So this gives you more information about this. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=319)   Now, let's go deep. 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=323)   This is deep, this is basics. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=326)   Detail, detail, detail. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=328)   This is just for decoration. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=332)   But it's sort of cool, because this reminds us that our sensory experience is a yin-yang thing. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=338)   And we see that in detail over here. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=343)   This reminds us that our path, our techniques, at a deep level arise through an interplay, 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=351)   maybe not exactly yin-yang, but there's a little expansive contractive. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=355)   So this reminds us of the deep view over here. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=360)   This is practice, this is the deep view of practice. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=363)   The interplay of active versus passive. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=366)   Work with the parts, work with the whole. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=368)   Make discriminations, break discriminations. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=371)   Manifest a self, go into the no self. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=376)   So this is the sort of the yin-yang, the inner game of practice is here. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=384)   And the sort of yin-yang of sensory experience, the basic molding forces, 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=390)   the tug of subjective versus objective activation, 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=394)   the surface manifestations of expansion and contraction, 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=399)   the deep manifestations of expansion and contraction, 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=402)   and the effortless activity of time itself, rising and passing simultaneously. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=409)   These are the forces, superficial and deep, that mold sensory experience. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=415)   So this is the doorway to the deep view on this. 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=422)   This is the doorway to the deep view on this. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=426)   And this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe, displayed here. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=435)   The title of the universe is Omega, which is related to the cosmological constant. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=448)   It's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as a whole. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=455)   And the universe is at the finest scale, the smallest spatial scale, is the Planck. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=464)   And then this thing with the dot, this circumpunk, 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=468)   represents all the structures that arise in between the universe as a whole 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=474)   and the Planck scale, the cosmic space scale and the Planck spatial scale. 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=482)   There's all these structures that sort of seem to reflect a contractive core 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=487)   and an expansive cloud or something along those lines. 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=493)   And what are they? Galaxies, supermassive black hole. 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=497)   In the center, effusive cloud of stars. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=500)   Suns, we talked about it, born in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=505)   and the contraction of self-gravity. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=509)   Planets, core-mantle atmosphere interactions, 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=517)   cause the in and out of the core and mantle, cause the surface continents to flow. 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=526)   The rising and falling of thermal currents cause the weather to flow. 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=535)   The human being, anatomically, it's got nerves at input, 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=542)   there's process in the brain, motor goes out. 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=547)   The heart and the capillaries, it's an expansive contraction thing. 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=553)   We have a similar kind of structure. 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=556)   And in our complicated, of all creatures, we are the ones that are most aware 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=561)   of the input-output in terms of cause and effect. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=567)   And so we live very much in that world also. 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=571)   The cell, I gave a whole talk about how the cell is formed by a lipid bilayer, 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=580)   with polar ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=588)   and the watery environment on the inside, creating an inside-outside situation. 
<br>[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=596)   Then macromolecules like proteins with nonpolar core 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=604)   and surrounded by polar radicals. 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=610)   And so what do those polar radicals do? 
<br>[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=614)   Well, they can migrate into this membrane 
<br>[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=619)   and start to create very complex interactions that are input-output of energy 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=628)   and matter and information into the cell. 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=632)   But same sort of deal. 
<br>[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=635)   Contractive core surrounded by this halo and then atoms, 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=640)   but very much in some ways like galaxies. 
<br>[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=643)   And at the base of it is the mathematics. 
<br>[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=647)   The operations of mathematics, which all have the same basic structure, 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=654)   just different flavor. 
<br>[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=656)   It's an intertwining of three kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. 
<br>[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=667)   You have step forward, step back, don't move. 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=679)   You have stretch out, pull in, don't move. 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=685)   You have whirl this way, whirl that way, don't move. 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=689)   All the movements of the dancer are represented by the mathematics 
<br>[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=696)   and therefore the fact that the mathematics seems to have this polarization, 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=709)   cancellation type of situation shouldn't surprise us 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=718)   because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience. 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=722)   And it seems to be something very fundamental about the way that, 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=729)   so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this. 
<br>[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=735)   There was a famous biomathematician named Haldane, H-A-L-D-A-N-E, 
<br>[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=743)   he was an Englishman. 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=746)   This was back in I guess the Victorian or Edwardian period, 
<br>[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=752)   maybe not quite that old, but back there, early 19th century, he was active. 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=759)   Someone once asked him, based on his study of mathematics and biology, 
<br>[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=767)   had he been able to discern any characteristics of the creator? 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=774)   Could he say anything about God's personality based on his development of this field of biomathematics? 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=783)   And he said, yes, as far as I can see, the main characteristic of God is 
<br>[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=791)   that he has an inordinate fondness for beetles. 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=796)   But actually, I would paraphrase Haldane. 
<br>[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=803)   I think God has an inordinate fondness for contrast and cancellation. 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=814)   That seems to be the pattern that we see very broadly. 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=820)   And that is everything important that I know. 
<br>[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciEbP0_I064&t=825)   Thank you.
