<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=0)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=4)   In terms of simultaneous expansion and contraction, 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=9)   something that I realized just in the last day or two, 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=13)   I kind of noted, how much I was appreciating 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=19)   something that used to be disturbing, 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=22)   was as soon as something arises it has begun to pass away. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=27)   And I was appreciating that, 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=29)   and I was appreciating the space it creates, 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=35)   and how holding on to something doesn't even occur 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=42)   when you're working with that. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=45)   And then I switched to the teacher mind and thought, 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=49)   okay, what's a fun game that I can create 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=53)   to help people just kind of touch in on that? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=57)   And I remembered noting gone with quick sounds, 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=67)   like the peacocks or the woman with the high heels 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=69)   or the clock ticking. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=71)   And I had mentioned before how it reminded me of 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=76)   when I was in high school and had a Ford Pinto 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=78)   and lived 1,500 miles away from home, 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=80)   and I had to drive long distances and had no money, 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=83)   and I learned to get behind trucks. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=85)   There was this little parking lot. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=86)   And what is it, draft? 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=88)   And I could go forever without using any gas. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=91)   There was this magic space behind trucks. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=94)   They don't like that, by the way. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=96)   Well, it's not because it's dangerous. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=98)   You shouldn't be doing it. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=99)   But it was a long time ago and I did it. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=101)   And because, you know, it was like, oh wow, this is so cool. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=104)   And it was like there was this magic space 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=107)   behind the trucks where you got a free ride. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=111)   And I started thinking of every little... 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=114)   Because usually when an arising happens 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=116)   we turn and look at it and then it's gone 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=118)   before we jump to the arising and we miss the gone 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=122)   and then the next one comes. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=123)   And I got to where I was thinking of arisings 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=126)   as each having this magic space behind them 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=129)   where you get a free ride. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=131)   Oh, cool. That's a great metaphor. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=132)   You know, and so every time something arose 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=135)   I'd go, free ride, free ride. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=137)   And it helped me not solidify on the arising. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=142)   And I was just thinking of that as we... 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=145)   Today as we were doing this and as I was... 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=147)   I did that as our middle thing. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=150)   And I thought, oh, that might be a fun game 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=153)   to help people just get a taste of not attaching 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=159)   to the solidity of the arising. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=163)   As we say in the industry... 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=166)   Can I use that? 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=171)   Eddie, no. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=172)   No, he didn't come back. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=174)   That was for him. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=179)   Oh, that's great. Free ride. Okay. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=183)   Life may not be a free lunch, but it is a free ride. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWkWakdFh-0&t=186)   It is a free ride.
