<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=0)   Recently, I've been coming to think of practice in terms of the distinction between formal 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=18)   practice and what I call life practice or practice in life. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=24)   So each formal practice, what characterizes formal practice is that a period of formal 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=35)   practice lasts at least 10 minutes, so there's a sort of duration aspect, and all your attention 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=43)   is going into maintaining the technique. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=46)   That makes it formal practice. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=50)   There are two basic kinds of formal practice, practice in stillness where you're not moving 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=54)   much, and practice in motion where you are moving. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=59)   You could be walking, you could be exercising, and so forth. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=63)   So I would encourage a person who wants to be successful with this path to do a little 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=71)   bit, a minimum of formal practice in stillness and formal practice in motion each day. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=79)   That's a minimum, 10 minutes. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=81)   Now that's minimum. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=84)   That might sound like not very much, but you'd be surprised how much resistance a person 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=90)   might have to doing that. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=94)   It's not a time thing. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=96)   Anybody has 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there to do formal practice. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=102)   It's not a time thing. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=104)   Then what is it? 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=106)   You might say that the ordinary coping mechanism, the normal coping mechanism that people have 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=119)   for dealing with life could be characterized as tighten up and turn away. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=127)   The new coping mechanism of this practice is the diametric opposite of that. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=134)   It's open up and turn towards. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=137)   Now you could think of the old coping mechanism as sort of being like 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=150)   how you've been getting air. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=154)   It sort of works, okay, but not really. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=159)   So if you start to challenge that coping mechanism by forcing yourself to have periods of open 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=171)   up and turn towards, at some point it might seem to your conditioning that you're like 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=180)   being asphyxiated. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=182)   You got to get a breath of air. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=185)   In this case, a breath of air is a hit of unconsciousness. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=191)   The practice is it's like your oxygen is being taken away. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=198)   Your former source of nutrition is being taken away. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=203)   You're starving to death. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=206)   You're flailing. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=209)   The only way to get nurtured or to get oxygen is to start to go completely unconscious again 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=216)   for long periods of time. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=219)   Formal practice won't allow you to go completely unconscious for long periods of time. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=226)   So it seems like you're starving to death or you're being asphyxiated. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=233)   That resistance then comes up. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=235)   It's not a time thing. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=237)   It's this other mechanism. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=241)   So what to do in that case? 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=243)   Well, recycle the reaction. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=244)   Get interested in deconstructing the resistance. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=249)   So in terms of formal practice, 10 minutes of stillness, 10 minutes of motion most days. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=258)   Practice in life, I've been dividing into what I call micro hits and then background 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=264)   practice. 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=265)   A micro hit is short and it's happening during ordinary life. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=273)   At the end of the day, you can say exactly how many of them you did, how long they lasted 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=278)   and when they took place. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=281)   And that's a way of tracking the extent to which you are stopping on a dime, starting 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=286)   on a dime. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=290)   So stop on a dime means that you suspend your investment with the content of in and out. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=305)   You suspend your investment with the pull of past and future. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=315)   And you establish an investment, 30 seconds here, 3 minutes there, with maintaining a 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=327)   technique. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=329)   What technique could be any technique? 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=332)   So what's a technique? 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=335)   Name a technique. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=336)   Hearing. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=337)   Open it up. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=338)   Ah, hearing. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=339)   Okay. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=340)   Hearing was the first one. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=341)   Hear rest, hear rest. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=345)   There's not going to be much hearing. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=350)   I'm doing the technique, okay. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=352)   After a while, there might be some hearing. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=354)   But I was just showing you, I could start on a dime. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=358)   We go a little broader. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=360)   See out, gone. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=362)   Feel in, gone. 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=364)   Feel rest, feel rest, see rest. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=367)   See out, gone. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=369)   See out, gone. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=370)   Feel in, gone. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=371)   See rest, see flow, see flow. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=375)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=376)   No hesitation. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=377)   No, well, I'm going to sit here and count my breath for 10 minutes and then I'm going 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=383)   to be settled enough to know what's going on. 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=387)   No, that is not starting on a dime. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=390)   Ten minutes. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=393)   Even ten seconds. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=396)   Ten seconds is too long. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=399)   I'd speak, between the stimulus and the response, there is a gap. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=407)   And it's not long. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=410)   Couple seconds, maybe. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=413)   And after that, the terrorists are in the cockpit running the show. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=418)   Emotional hijack. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=419)   Amygdala, amygdala hijack. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=425)   So we need to train ourselves to stop on a dime, start on a dime. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=431)   Stop on a dime doesn't necessarily mean that you stop moving around. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=435)   It means that you instantaneously suspend involvement with the content of in and out. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=444)   And you are involved with the technique. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=448)   But it doesn't have to be long. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=449)   It can be while you're walking around, even talking to people and so forth. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=456)   So that's the micro hit. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=457)   It can be any technique you want. 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=466)   The places where you would tend to do micro hits during the day are dead times when you're 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=473)   waiting in line or you're in a meeting and it's this vacuous conversation going on that 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=482)   you don't really need all your CPU to look like you're paying attention. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=491)   So it's sort of like the dead times. 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=493)   The dead times become the magic times. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=496)   You're waiting for your system to reboot. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=501)   I had this idea once to create a Dharma virus that would cause people's computers to suspend 
<br>[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=514)   operation until I had done 30 seconds. 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=519)   They have that on a Mac. 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=520)   It's called the beach ball of death. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=522)   The beach ball of death? 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=523)   The whirling ball when it's having a hard time. 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=526)   That for me is mine. 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=527)   Yeah, right. 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=528)   So these are the sort of dead times. 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=534)   Then there's the times just before and just after what you think is going to be a stressful 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=542)   event. 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=544)   You can have a stress rehearsal. 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=547)   Stress rehearsal is stress rehearsal. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=555)   I have one student that basically his entire life is telephone calls. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=569)   Most of the calls are telling passionate and powerful people no. 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=580)   So these are sometimes difficult calls to make. 
<br>[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=585)   So he can use focus in now. 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=590)   I taught him focus in. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=591)   Just 30 seconds, okay? 
<br>[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=594)   He just prepares himself, watches the resistance. 
<br>[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=598)   It's, oh my God, I'm calling so and so and I'm telling them news they don't want to hear. 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=607)   And then he can just make the call and if there's any after whatever, another 30 seconds, 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=613)   clears it, ready to move on. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=618)   So before and after stressful things, micro hits. 
<br>[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=622)   Now the beauty of the concept of micro hit is you can check in on your own practice in 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=630)   a very tangible way. 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=632)   There's no BS, okay, because how many did you do? 
<br>[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=639)   When did you do them? 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=640)   What was the technique? 
<br>[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=642)   For how long did they last? 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=644)   That will tell you how many times during the day you are severing the trammels of time. 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=664)   Okay, then what do I mean by background practice or having a background technique? 
<br>[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=674)   Well a lot of people report something like this. 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=679)   It's like, well I don't go completely unconscious, but I'm not putting a lot of intention in 
<br>[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=686)   having a technique going, but it's sort of going in the background while I'm going about 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=692)   life activities. 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=697)   And some people are able to have that going much of the day. 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=701)   It's not sharp, it's not, there's no mental labels or anything, or maybe not much of that, 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=709)   but it's sort of going in the background as opposed to just the way I used to be where 
<br>[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=716)   I would just completely be lost and unconscious and driven and so forth. 
<br>[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=724)   So that kind of thing may or may not come naturally to you. 
<br>[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=730)   If it does, it's just something to know about. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=733)   It's a component of practice. 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=736)   If it doesn't come naturally for you, that's okay. 
<br>[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=739)   But the one thing everyone can do because it's so well defined and so crisp is the micro 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=746)   hits. 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=747)   Like I say, okay, if you're serious about this practice, you're going to have a half 
<br>[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=754)   dozen or so micro hits every day. 
<br>[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=758)   And the less you feel like stopping on a dime, the more powerful doing so is going to be. 
<br>[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=769)   When you least want to stop on a dime, when you're most caught up in the bondage of past 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=777)   and future, inside and outside, is when it's going to be most powerful to stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=786)   You can use spoken labels to ensure quality because it's not going to be quantity, right? 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=792)   It's going to be short if your life situation allows for it. 
<br>[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=801)   For me, often the stop on a dime feels like I'm going to die. 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=811)   It feels like I'm being marched off to a firing squad or something. 
<br>[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=819)   And that's good. 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=820)   That means I'm doing it right. 
<br>[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=822)   That means I really am going toe to toe with the forces of the somethingness of self and 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=832)   world. 
<br>[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=837)   So that gives you potentially four elements. 
<br>[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=845)   Formal practice, practice in life. 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=848)   Formal practice, you have stillness, motion. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=850)   Practice in life, you have micro hits, background, practice. 
<br>[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=857)   And with regards to the formal practice, for practice in stillness, two accelerators, trigger 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=862)   practice and duration training. 
<br>[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=865)   For practice in motion, the challenge sequence. 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=868)   It's all described in great detail in the reading we sent you. 
<br>[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=874)   If you line up these elements, if you at least occasionally do the accelerators, push the 
<br>[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=881)   envelope of the length of a sit at least occasionally, under the parameters described, occasionally 
<br>[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=893)   explore systematically triggering hot and cold buttons. 
<br>[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=901)   Try to do not just practice in stillness and not just walking meditation, but can I do 
<br>[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=909)   focus in while I'm washing the dishes? 
<br>[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=914)   How deep can I get with focus in while I'm washing the dishes? 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=918)   Focus out on the way to work, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=922)   So you give yourself the motion challenge sequence at least occasionally. 
<br>[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=926)   So those would be the ducts that you would want to line up for day to day practice. 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=934)   If you line up those ducts for day to day practice, what else is left? 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=942)   Well, at least once a year do the equivalent of a one week retreat. 
<br>[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=951)   That's absolute minimum. 
<br>[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=954)   When I say the equivalent, not everyone in the world can get away for seven days or 10 
<br>[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=960)   days to do a residential retreat. 
<br>[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=962)   In fact, most people can't. 
<br>[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=964)   But there are ways of doing the equivalent. 
<br>[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=967)   For one thing, the home practice program, which we created, which almost anyone can 
<br>[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=972)   do as long as you speak English and you can get cheap long distance or you have internet 
<br>[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=984)   with Skype, then you can have a retreat practice. 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=990)   You just have to sort of amortize it over the years, spread it out. 
<br>[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=998)   But a four hour or eight hour program, if you did enough of several of those, many of 
<br>[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1006)   those over a year, that sort of will serve as your retreat practice. 
<br>[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1013)   During retreats, as you see, you build up a certain momentum. 
<br>[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1017)   Then you go back to your daily regimen. 
<br>[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1021)   And instead of that being a peak experience, it may go down a bit, but it becomes a stable 
<br>[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1026)   plateau. 
<br>[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1027)   You now grow gradually with your daily elements and then do your next retreat. 
<br>[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1035)   And then as you look over the big picture of the years and decades of practice, what 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1041)   you'll see is as a general trend, the retreats take you to a new level. 
<br>[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1046)   The daily practice backs it up with more modest growth. 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1051)   And so you have this sort of stepwise growth curve. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1057)   And if you look at the overall envelope of the curve, at some point it becomes evident 
<br>[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1063)   that it is in fact exponential. 
<br>[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1070)   When does the break point in this exponential curve come? 
<br>[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1073)   The break point means when it goes from looking modest and linear to, oh my god, this is really 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1080)   taking off. 
<br>[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1082)   That's the point at which the derivative starts to go infinite. 
<br>[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1088)   The break point occurs when you start to get the immediate taste of purification. 
<br>[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1108)   As soon as you bring equanimity to an experience, you don't have to wait. 
<br>[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1113)   You just bring the equanimity to it and you sense that sources of unhappiness are breaking 
<br>[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1121)   up. 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1122)   You can actually taste it happening. 
<br>[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1125)   I can't put it into words. 
<br>[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1126)   It's the Vishuddhi rasa. 
<br>[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1130)   I made up a word in Sanskrit. 
<br>[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1133)   This word should exist in Sanskrit. 
<br>[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1135)   Vishuddhi means purification. 
<br>[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1138)   Rasa means taste. 
<br>[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1141)   There's a taste. 
<br>[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1144)   And it's impossible to put into words, but once the spiritual palate matures so that 
<br>[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1151)   you can taste it, that's the break point. 
<br>[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1154)   Because now you're dealing with operant conditioning, Skinnerian conditioning. 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1161)   It's a positive feedback loop. 
<br>[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1162)   It's just classic math. 
<br>[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1169)   The taste of purification can't be put into words, but as I say, its acquisition marks 
<br>[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1178)   the transition to a mature spiritual palate. 
<br>[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1185)   There are tastes that kids just don't understand. 
<br>[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1189)   Why would anyone drink coffee? 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1195)   Most kids can't understand spicy foods either, I think. 
<br>[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1198)   It's like, why do adults put this in their mouth? 
<br>[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1203)   It's bitter. 
<br>[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1204)   It hurts. 
<br>[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1205)   There's not a taste called spice. 
<br>[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1208)   You know what spice is? 
<br>[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1211)   Spice is pure pain. 
<br>[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1215)   It's the raw nerves. 
<br>[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1220)   It's the actual, the same nerves that give you a pain signal are what are stimulated 
<br>[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1226)   by capsaicin. 
<br>[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1230)   In fact, that's a way of inducing lab pain. 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1233)   But anyway, that's... 
<br>[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1239)   Why would anybody like something that hurts in their mouth? 
<br>[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1246)   Why would anybody like anything that's bitter? 
<br>[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1251)   Most kids cannot understand why adults eat this kind of stuff. 
<br>[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1257)   But the palate changes. 
<br>[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1260)   So there's a taste that comes about when a person experiences pleasure or pain with equanimity. 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1271)   And the taste is identical. 
<br>[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1272)   It doesn't matter whether it's with physical pain, emotional pain, physical pleasure, or 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1277)   emotional pleasure. 
<br>[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1280)   There's a knowing that because of the way I'm greeting this in this moment, the poison 
<br>[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1288)   and pain from previous moments is being wiped away and every moment of the future will be 
<br>[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1295)   marginally less suffering and more fulfilling. 
<br>[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1300)   It's a kind of knowing of that. 
<br>[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1302)   When that reward flavor, the taste of purification, which is just the taste of equanimity or the 
<br>[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1310)   effect of equanimity, when that comes on, that's when the growth curve goes like this. 
<br>[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1315)   Because now the preoccupation with feeling good is starting to go away. 
<br>[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1324)   You've got another kind of feel good that's not the old kind of feel good. 
<br>[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1334)   It's just its own thing. 
<br>[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1336)   And it's available on demand. 
<br>[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1338)   So either you feel good intrinsically or you don't feel good and you have equanimity and 
<br>[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1344)   you feel good. 
<br>[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1345)   So now it just takes off. 
<br>[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1349)   That's when it goes like that. 
<br>[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1351)   So if you can get these elements in place, then you'll be in good shape. 
<br>[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1366)   The day-to-day rhythm, formal practice, practice in life, stillness, motion, micro hits, background 
<br>[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1374)   practice, accelerators at least occasionally. 
<br>[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1378)   You have that day-to-day. 
<br>[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1381)   You have retreats. 
<br>[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1383)   If you're fortunate enough to do residential retreats, great. 
<br>[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1387)   But some intensive formal practice that's more than just a long sit. 
<br>[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1395)   What else do you need? 
<br>[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1396)   Well, at least occasionally touch base with someone who's competent to guide the big picture 
<br>[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1402)   of your practice. 
<br>[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1404)   That's a very specific job. 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1407)   You can have many teachers. 
<br>[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1412)   But you need to have at least one person that knows how to guide people through the entire 
<br>[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1423)   range of classical experiences that this practice can potentially bring about. 
<br>[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1434)   So you touch base with that person once, twice a year to talk about the big picture of your 
<br>[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yExoNZLCjDE&t=1440)   practice. 
<br>
