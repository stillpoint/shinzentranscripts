<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=0)   There's the very instant when something starts. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=12)   And that's the primordial perfection of the source acting. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=19)   And that is the world that we lived in, in infancy. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=26)   I have vague recollections of that time. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=30)   It's taken years of practice to remember what it was like. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=37)   I remember three watersheds. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=44)   I have a vague recollection of when I was just expanding, contracting effortless space 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=51)   instead of having objectified experience of self and world. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=57)   I can remember that. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=58)   I can remember discovering the power of crying. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=66)   If I cried, I would get this attention. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=72)   That was a really major epiphany. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=78)   And then I remember this horrible, horrible thing happening. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=84)   It just sort of came on. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=86)   It came out of nowhere. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=89)   And it just came on like gangbusters. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=98)   I started to worry about things. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=103)   I started to have thoughts and fears. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=111)   I don't know how old, but I'm imagining two, three, four, something like that. 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=120)   It was like, what is this? 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=123)   This wasn't here before. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=126)   Suddenly I was worried and afraid and thinking about stuff. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=133)   That was the arising of the inner system as a self. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=139)   I can remember it coming on. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=142)   It's like, what is this? 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=144)   What's happening to me? 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=148)   It's like, why am I scared and thinking? 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=151)   Of course, I didn't have those words for it, but in retrospect. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=155)   I can remember those watersheds. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=157)   We can go back as adults with our adult competency and have the best of both worlds. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=166)   We can experience, because our first world is never really lost, our very first world. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsPcWEZFaKA&t=175)   We're now here, now always, always a condition of complete simplicity.
