<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=0)   So what is the most rewarding thing for you as a teacher? 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=11)   Not hard to imagine. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=13)   It's seeing progress of people that study with me. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=18)   That's the most rewarding thing. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=23)   And that progress takes various forms. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=26)   Some people experience little progress, little pieces of progress. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=31)   Every once in a while somebody actually has a major insight. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=41)   So that's what's rewarding for me as a teacher is seeing the progress of the students. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=49)   I only judge my worth as a teacher in terms of the progress of the student. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=57)   Confucius said, not to learn is the student's fault. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=62)   Not to teach is the teacher's fault. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=65)   I disagree. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=71)   If the student doesn't learn, it's not the student's fault. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=74)   It's the teacher's fault. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=76)   It's my fault. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=79)   In other words, it's the job of the teacher to make it possible for the student to learn. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=85)   We can't say, oh well, you don't have the right karma or whatever. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=91)   It's like if they're not getting it, it's on me. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=93)   It's not on them. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=95)   So to find a way to communicate with them. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=98)   So you're talking about communication skills. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=101)   Well yes. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=102)   Unless you're doing a transmission. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=104)   You asked me what's most rewarding. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=109)   In general, what's most rewarding is when the students make progress. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=121)   If a student happens to have a classical liberation experience, which happens occasionally, the 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=129)   sudden kinds of things, that of course is really, really good. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=136)   So that's extremely rewarding. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=141)   The other rewarding thing for me is if I can figure out something new, something that hasn't 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=151)   been tried before, that works. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=154)   Which you do on a daily basis. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=156)   You're always coming up with something new. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=158)   Well I go around with a notebook. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=162)   I would say that although I've been guiding people for some 35 years, I learn something 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=171)   new every day. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=173)   And I take notes on my own process. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=178)   Every once in a while I get these epiphanies of creativity with regards to how you can 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=185)   teach people. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=186)   And when I get one of those, that's really, really good. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=191)   And that's extremely fulfilling. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=194)   I try it out and it actually works. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=197)   My ultimate goal as a teacher is that anything I have personally experienced, I could lead 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=205)   anybody else to that experience. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvLb0Nqxpc&t=208)   That's what I set for myself as my goal.
