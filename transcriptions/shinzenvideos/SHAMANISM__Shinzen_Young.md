title: "SHAMANISM ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=0)   Well, there's a lot to say about shamanism, so I'll try to sort of limit it. First of 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=15)   all, I actually talk about this in my book, The Science of Enlightenment, the notion that 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=24)   you can look upon consciousness as sort of like a three-layered parfait, and you have 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=31)   surface ordinary objectified experience that might be called conventional reality. Then 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=37)   you have the absolute rest and the formless doing that is at the very quote center, if 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=45)   we wanted to use that metaphor. It's not perfectly good, but if you imagine it's a sphere and 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=51)   there's the surface, and then there's what's in the center, which is the dharmakaya, it's 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=58)   formless. Then there's all these intermediate realms. And if we think of the spiritual path 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=68)   as a journey from surface to source, some people are going to traverse those intermediate 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=74)   realms without any unusual phenomena at all. They're just going to go right down. Some 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=83)   people are going to encounter the pool of poison and pain and trauma and such big time, 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=97)   which is sort of the Freudian subconscious. Some people are going to encounter the Jungian 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=103)   subconscious, God's, ghosts, ancestors, healing abilities, etc. etc. The spirit world, basically 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=115)   what native people would refer to as a spirit world. Some people encounter both the Jungian 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=121)   and the Freudian version of the subconscious. As I say, some people encounter neither. They 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=128)   just go right down. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=136)   There can be a couple extremes with regards to this map of the journey. One is not uncommon. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=145)   So you're on the surface and the journey is not turning 180 degrees away from the world. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=152)   It's actually turning orthogonal. It's turning 90 degrees into an independent dimension, 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=159)   which is the dimension of depth as opposed to surface. So now you're going down. Of course, 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=166)   each level has its own surface. One extreme is you go down a little bit and you encounter 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=174)   either the Freudian subconscious or the Jungian subconscious. If it's the Freudian, you just 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=186)   don't want to go there. If it's the pleasant side of the Jungian, well, that's one thing. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=192)   But if it's sort of weird and scary archetypal material, you don't want to go there. So you 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=200)   flail your way back to the surface like a drowning person gasping for air. I'm never 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=205)   going to go down there again because that's just too weird. That's one extreme. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=211)   Another extreme, which is the extreme I recommend, is you just keep going down no matter what. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=223)   Keep a plumb line, a direct vector towards the source. It's not just me. The Christian 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=233)   tradition says the same thing, although they think of it as going up rather than down. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=241)   But it doesn't matter. The direction of the coordinates, the grid, doesn't make any difference 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=248)   at all. St. John of the Cross drew this picture of this mountain, Mount Carmel, which actually 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=257)   exists in the Holy Land. It's near the city of Haifa in northern Israel. Cho and I visited 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=264)   there. It's pretty cool. It's the origin of the Carmelite order, which was one of the 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=269)   main meditating orders back in the day. Anyway, he drew Mount Carmel and he talked about subida 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=279)   del monte Carmelo, the ascent of Mount Carmel. In this metaphor, God or the source is not 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=289)   at the source. It's actually at the pinnacle, but it's exactly the same thing. On it he 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=300)   writes nada, nada, nada, y en monte nada. This is how you're going to get there. Nothing, 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=310)   nothing, nothing. When you finally get to the peak of the mountain, nothing with a big 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=315)   capital N. Then he shows these wild monsters and flowers and things. He says, if you want 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=324)   to ascend Mount Carmel, you cannot allow yourself to be distracted by the flowers nor frightened 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=332)   by the wild beasts. You have to just go straight up. Same general idea. The other extreme is, 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=341)   no matter what sorts of bouquets or beasties you may encounter, as you go down, you just 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=349)   keep going down. Which in terms of classical dry vipassana would just mean whatever comes 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=356)   up you just observe, just observe, just observe. That's an extreme. Here's another extreme. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=362)   You go down to a certain level and you get interested in the content of that level. Usually 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=368)   it's something that involves special powers. Without realizing it, you turn 90 degrees 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=376)   again. The pernicious part of this is you don't know it. You think you're on a vector 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=383)   to the source, but in fact you're now going parallel to ordinary experience out into the 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=390)   realms of power, exploring them. You can spend a lot of time doing that. As I say, there's 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=396)   actually nothing wrong with exploring those realms, unless you think you're still going 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=404)   down. Then that becomes a shunt away from progress. What's in between? So between turning 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=419)   90 degrees again, right? You're here on the surface, 90 degrees down, and then gradually 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=425)   without realizing it, you turn 90 degrees again, right? Now you're going parallel, but 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=430)   you don't know it. One extreme is you're only interested in the realms of power. The Lakota 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=440)   Sioux call those people Pejuta Wiccasha, which actually literally is a medicine person or 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=448)   a healer. Then the other extreme is what I mentioned. You don't go into those realms 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=457)   at all, you just purify and get insight. In Lakota that is referred to as a Wiccasha Wakana, 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=465)   a sacred person. The spectrum of classical shamanism all over the world, and this is 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=473)   the original religion of our species everywhere. There was a time when everyone, as far as 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=480)   I anthropologists know, everyone sort of had essentially the same religion, and it was 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=487)   shamanism. This is the old time religion. Judaism, Christianity, Confucianism, what 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=495)   have you, they may be old, but they're not old the way this is old. They're not 10, 20, 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=501)   30, 40,000 years old, okay? So the spectrum of classical shamanism ranges through all 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=512)   the oblique angles, from pure power to pure purification, but most shamans that I've ever 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=520)   met are on an intermediate angle. They're definitely gaining no self-purification insight. 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=528)   There's a component to that vector of going down, but there's also a component out of 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=534)   it. And depending on the relative magnitude of your interest in power and what the spirits 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=544)   have to say versus the egolessness and oneness and so forth. So that's why I speak of the 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=553)   spectrum of classical shamanism. It goes all the way from... And in the power area, you 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=561)   can actually get cultural negatives that are very intense for those cultures. You can have 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=574)   very dysfunctional cultures. It's not just modern people that are messed up, okay? There 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=583)   are traditional cultures that have really messed up views of the world. It's not uncommon, 
<br>[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=595)   for example, to believe that death is not natural. If someone dies, it's because someone 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=602)   killed them and probably killed them with medicine. And by medicine, I mean magic. So 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=612)   American Indians have an entire vocabulary. It's English, so they can talk inter-tribally, 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=620)   but it's English you would never understand. You wouldn't know what it means to shoot medicine 
<br>[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=625)   at someone or to get engaged in a medicine war with another tribe. That's warfare in 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=634)   the power realms, and they take that absolutely as seriously as warfare on the surface. It's 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=640)   the same deal. Someone dies, go to the shaman, why did they die? Those guys up the river 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=648)   shot medicine at us. And then we got to either shoot arrows at them or shoot medicine back. 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=655)   So it's not necessarily a good thing, okay? It really depends on the culture. I mean, 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=663)   I've had friends for whom medicine wars were a serious business. I have to say, I don't 
<br>[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=674)   share the paradigm, but I knew it was very real for them. And they were from these kinds 
<br>[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=683)   of cultures and so forth. So anyway, there's this spectrum that I call the spectrum of 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=690)   classical shamanism. And if like, well, I guess maybe this is going into too much detail. 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=705)   There's a lot of fear in the Navajo culture, for example, of shape shifters. So there can 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=712)   be some real negatives around some of this stuff. 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=719)   So let me tell you a story, a personal story about shamanism. Years and years ago, decades 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=733)   ago, actually, I was running a retreat in Tucson. Steve knows, I'm going to talk about 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=742)   Steve knows this medicine person. So we were running a retreat at this ranch, Doug Boy's 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=749)   ranch. And this is nigh unto 40 years ago, I think. So a while back, maybe not that, 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=760)   maybe 1985, I guess. And so Doug was very into Native American spirituality, but he'd 
<br>[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=771)   grown up in Korea, actually. His father was, I guess, in the military. So he knew a lot 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=777)   about Asian culture. And he wanted the Buddhist teachers to get together with the Native American 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=783)   teachers. So he said, there's a local Tohono O'odham. That's a tribe that anthropologists 
<br>[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=791)   used to call the Pima Papago. So there's a local Tohono O'odham Indian. His name 
<br>[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=798)   is Rupert Encinas. And if you want, he'll do a sweat lodge for you, sweat lodge ceremony. 
<br>[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=808)   So I said, well, what is it? Tell me what, you know, after the retreat, we could do this 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=814)   sweat lodge. So it was, well, what's a sweat lodge? Describe it to me. He described it 
<br>[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=819)   and made sense. I could see how it would fit with Buddhist practice. And he said, Rupert 
<br>[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=826)   is a pipe carrier. He's a road man in the Native American church, which is the peyote 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=832)   religion, which is the North American version of ayahuasca, basically. And he's a sun dancer. 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=839)   I said, well, what's a sun dance? And he described that and sort of made sense to me. 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=846)   So we had this sweat lodge. And I remember, so that was my first lodge. And so it's 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=856)   out on the rez and there's no technology. He didn't even have electricity in his house 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=864)   at that time. I mean, now he's got a cell phone and YouTube segments and things like 
<br>[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=871)   that. But things change, right? But back then, he didn't even have electricity. 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=877)   But so anyway, so I remember there was this point where, you know, you open the flap. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=888)   And he was running it the Lakota way. There's different ways of running a sweat lodge. He 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=894)   was doing it the Lakota way. So the Lakota or Eastern Sioux, the person that pours the 
<br>[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=900)   water sits at the door. So he opens the door. All the steam goes out. There is the pristine 
<br>[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=907)   Sonora Desert without any telephone lines or cars or anything. It looked the way it 
<br>[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=916)   looked 20,000 years ago. And the sun's coming down. And it's sort of glancing rays. He's 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=929)   full-blood Indian, just classic. Looks like something right out of the Smithsonian Institute. 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=935)   So his profile is long hair, you know, because you unbraid your hair in the ceremony, right? 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=942)   So he's got the long hair. And like classic Native American features. And you could see 
<br>[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=952)   the sun was revealing a chest full of piercing scars from the sun dance. Like he'd sun danced 
<br>[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=961)   16 times at that time. And that was 35 years ago. 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=971)   And it was like, oh my God, this is a time tunnel that we're being allowed to enter to 
<br>[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=982)   experience what our really remote ancestors experienced. And it was just amazing to me. 
<br>[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=997)   And when I got out, I remember crawling out. It was pretty hot lodge. And I remember the 
<br>[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1008)   first thought that went through my mind. Oh, this is what they call, quote, primitive religion. 
<br>[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1018)   Because shamanism used to be called primitive religion. And the reason for the air quotes 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1023)   is it was so advanced, so subtle, so multi-leveled, so psycho-spiritually sophisticated. Weaving 
<br>[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1036)   group therapy into prayer, into the power realms, into purification through equanimity, 
<br>[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1043)   into being forced to concentrate because you just can't do anything but concentrate. 
<br>[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1050)   So it's like, oh, primitive religion. And meaning, of course, that when the Europeans 
<br>[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1058)   came here, it's true that a metal ax is a more advanced tool than a stone ax. But I 
<br>[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1070)   guess they assumed that because the physical technology was quote, primitive, that the 
<br>[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1077)   psycho-spiritual life of those people was primitive. And it was the very antithesis 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1084)   of that. So anyway, that was my first encounter with shamanism. And I'll be seeing Rupert 
<br>[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1093)   again next month when I go to Tucson, 35, however many years later. We're still doing 
<br>[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33u14OjeHpE&t=1099)   ceremonies together.
