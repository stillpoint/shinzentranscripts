<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=0)   Here, the basic formula, as you'll recall, is mindful awareness leads to six factors 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=24)   that constitute, let's just say it's for you, this is the happy pointing to you. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=34)   There's six things that are thought of as being, whoops, let's do it surface first. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=42)   Surface or ordinary human happiness, and remember it was get pleasure in the body, avoid discomfort 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=53)   in the body, get various answers in the mind, avoid don't know mind, in the mind, get situations 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=65)   that you want and avoid situations that you don't want, okay. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=72)   This ordinary happiness plus deep happiness for yourself. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=80)   Deep happiness, you remember the difference, okay, here you want fulfillment, here you 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=87)   want to elevate fulfillment, you want to avoid suffering, you want to get the answer and 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=96)   you want to be able to experience don't know mind as an okay thing. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=107)   And then here, instead of situations, it's behavior. 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=110)   You want to manifest a love cause and effect, positive behavior, cut down on negative objective 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=116)   behavior, those are the objective factors, these are the sensory factors. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=121)   This leads to a motivation to help other people and I mentioned why that is and what form 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=133)   that takes. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=135)   So this is a love of the human condition. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=141)   What I drew there, it was a heart and this is the Chinese character for humanity. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=147)   This is bodhicitta. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=152)   This leads to bodhicitta in the Buddhist context, which then leads you to spread surface and 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=162)   deep happiness to others and all of this, this plus this and this equals total human 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=177)   happiness. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=181)   It's this plus this. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=182)   It's not just learning how to get fulfillment, it's also getting pleasure. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=190)   It's not just avoiding suffering, it's also avoiding discomfort. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=194)   It's not just getting enlightenment answers, it's getting these two, these together, the 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=200)   situations you want. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=202)   So this plus this leading to this, leading to this, you'll be happy in every way. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c1WihJK1tA&t=215)   So that's details about happiness.
