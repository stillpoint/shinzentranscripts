<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=0)   I'm going to show you these. 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=7)   You're going to see some people that you haven't seen. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=16)   I see. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=17)   Oh my God. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=18)   I mean, wow, from this far? 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=32)   Okay, well, I'll try to process all this. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=40)   Thank you for showing up and for what you do. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=48)   What can I say? 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=50)   Does this mean we're not doing the training? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=57)   Something else is happening. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=60)   There was no training. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=62)   It is all about your 75th birthday. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=66)   That's self-righting. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=68)   I'm off the hook then. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=70)   So what about these facilitators? 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=73)   Okay, well, here we go. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=84)   It was a ruse. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=85)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=86)   You know what? 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=88)   In the back of my mind, I had a little... 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=91)   No, he did. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=93)   Yes, he did. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=95)   Well, because it's a big number and it's been known to happen. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=103)   So anyway, but then when we came up here for lunch, 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=109)   there was not this. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=111)   So I thought, oh, okay, good. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=115)   My life will be simple. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=118)   So it worked in the sense that no, I didn't expect it. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=125)   But it's great to see you all and get to know each other. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=129)   Not all of you know each other. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=131)   You come from all sorts of places and periods and whatever. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=138)   Some people here really go back. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=141)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=148)   It's like talk to people. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTK2TzAV5A&t=150)   Yeah, I wish everyone could see.
