title: "What technique does Shinzen use?"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=0)   Out of curiosity, what strategy do you generally employ using your technique? 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=11)   You mean as I'm laughing around in the world? 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=13)   No, not on the cushion. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=15)   Oh, on the cushion? 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=17)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=18)   Mostly both God. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=22)   Simultaneous expansion, contraction, and their vanishing. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=26)   So flow and... 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=27)   Well, both. Both is the label for an awareness that there is simultaneous expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=35)   That's part of the... 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=39)   So the quick answer is in terms of what's on the grid is expansion, contraction, flow. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=44)   That's what I typically am aware of. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=47)   Okay. And then last thing was when I was reading in the manual about that for us, 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=55)   it was... because I love flow and so forth, 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=58)   but I also saw that it was like don't forget to stay in, 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=63)   you know, see here and feel rest, focus out. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=67)   And focus out and focus in just because there's subtle levels that you don't want to... 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=72)   you know, that you're still needing to process. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=75)   I understand. So it's okay to have sort of a main practice. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=81)   But if you're familiar with the whole grid, I encourage people at least occasionally to touch base with other things just to get some balance. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=90)   But that's just a light suggestion. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=93)   If you're not familiar with the whole grid, obviously you can't do that. 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=97)   But let's say you're familiar with the whole thing. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=99)   I think it's... a lot of people have a single thing that they do that's their main practice. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=107)   And if you are familiar with this other stuff, I think it's useful to touch base at least occasionally with it for rounding purposes. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=116)   But if you're not familiar with the whole grid, then you just can have just one practice. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=122)   But remember that one of the ways you push the envelope is by... 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=130)   if there's a particular approach that you like, you see, well, can you maintain it in motion and then in daily life, etc. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=142)   So maybe you could get a lot of flow when you're sitting, but can you actually get it while you're talking to people and driving the car? 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqh0teMWrTQ&t=150)   That's a way of pushing the envelope with the practice.
