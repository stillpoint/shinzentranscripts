<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=0)   It's interesting too because when I had a physical issue a year ago where I had excruciating 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=16)   pain in my body, what happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned, 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=22)   was singeing very hot. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=24)   And the neurologist and everybody said it was probably in response to the pain. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=28)   They said it's just your body's in an alarm alert mode. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=31)   That's getting activated by this fear. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=33)   So like I have that in addition, so you're talking about hot, you know. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=40)   I've got that on the outside, this kind of singeing. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=44)   That will definitely, that directly corresponds with the intensity of the feeling. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=51)   So that's enough, isn't it? 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=54)   It's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=61)   Do you think that it's interacting with subtle levels of talk or image? 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=72)   Very very subtle. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=73)   What do you mean interacting? 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=74)   By that I mean that the fear and sadness might be intensified by subtle subliminal activations 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=89)   of visual or auditory thinking. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=93)   What I think is happening, and this is just having been working with it now for a while, 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=98)   I think it's like if there's a deck of cards that's all the images and thoughts that we 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=103)   have in a pool that one hit something and it went down and if there were like little 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=110)   shavings of metal, I'm sorry I went back away from deck of cards, little shavings, all of 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=114)   those came up and each one of those is an image or it could be image or talk stuff, 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=120)   but it's just like, and so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=124)   enough to go, oh yes, that's when I was five. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=129)   That's exactly what I mean by that. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=130)   And when that comes up it can poke, it can, it can kind of like add a little bit of a 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=137)   wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might poke 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=145)   in the feel a little bit, but if I stay with the feel they just kind of hang out. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=150)   So the answer to the question is yes, there is interaction with subtle image, which is 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=158)   significant, and also characteristic of catharsis, although it may primarily come up as body 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=166)   feel flavors, subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the gestalt, especially 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=176)   the visual, because people don't usually hear hell, they usually see hell, although in theory 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=186)   you can hear it too, but image space is where the monsters are that might be linked to all 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=194)   of this. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=195)   So that gives me some of the more information that I need. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=200)   Okay now believe it or not, yet more questions, okay, because well, because we've got to see 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=205)   what's really going on and I don't. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=208)   You're doing your house. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=209)   Yeah, well you interviewed me. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=210)   You're doing your house MD. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=211)   This is called differential diagnosis baby. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=212)   These are my huge diagnostic skills. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=222)   Okay so, let's see here. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=231)   Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear that was pervasive through the 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=238)   body so dissolved into flow that it no longer caused you suffering? 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=246)   Yes. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=247)   How about sadness? 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=249)   Have you ever done that? 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=251)   Okay, so then you've already done what we're going to be working towards. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=255)   We're going to be working towards that experience yet again, because it's a matter of, I mean 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=264)   basically, what, let's see, one, two, three, four, maybe there's four kinds of human beings. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=274)   I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans, right? 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=278)   But maybe one way to classify all human beings is there's most human beings who have never 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=286)   had the experience of physical pain flowing so completely that it turned into a flavor 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=294)   of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=298)   Most humans have never had that experience. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=301)   So that's most humans. 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=303)   Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=312)   Then there are the humans that have had that same experience but with regards to rage, 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=319)   terror, or grief. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=322)   That's a whole other thing than physical pain in terms of what it's like when that breaks 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=328)   up. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=329)   So we've determined that... 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=330)   And I think harder. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=332)   Incomparably harder. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=334)   Because pain is just pain. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=337)   The emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and distort 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=344)   us. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=345)   They've been honed by evolution for that task. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=348)   That's what hell is. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=350)   Hell is rage, terror, grief, shame, flavors that have become so activated that they're 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=360)   able to convince you that not only will this be all you ever experience from now on, they're 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=369)   actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=374)   They have that much distorting power so that it seems like eternal in both directions. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=381)   That would be hell. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=385)   Purgatory is when you've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=393)   illusion anymore, but they're still there and you're working with them. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=398)   And then the threshold between purgatory and heaven is when it turns into flow that we've 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=410)   been talking about. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=412)   So believe it or not, one other question, besides fear and sadness, are there hints 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=417)   of any other flavors in there? 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=420)   Like anger or shame specifically? 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=423)   I've actually looked specifically for them. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=426)   I think the shame flavor can... 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=432)   Like if something happens in the extra world that embarrasses me, I feel that shame and 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=437)   that can trigger all this. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=441)   Is it part of the present gestalt, the shame flavor, or is it pretty much we're dealing 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=447)   with sad and had? 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=451)   If we call fear had. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=453)   Just for alliteration. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=454)   I know, I'm going to go for it. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=461)   Because there's mad, sad, glad, and had. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=465)   You're changing my feel flavors here. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=467)   Don't worry. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=468)   It's okay. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=469)   They'll come back. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=470)   I'll get back to hell soon. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=471)   Okay. 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=472)   Here's what's interesting. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=473)   You know that heat I talked about in the body? 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=477)   It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flesh. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=484)   And so it can trigger it. 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=487)   So they all kind of interlinked in that way? 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=491)   It's all information that I need to do the guidance. 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApsLcL_7SnU&t=498)   And I think I have enough. 
<br>
