title: "SHAKTIPAT or ENERGY TRANSMISSION in BUDDHISM ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=0)   So, I had some interesting questions that people gave me. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=14)   So one was, is there anything like Shaktipat in Buddhism? 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=21)   So how many people know what the word Shaktipat means? 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=28)   Just curious. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=29)   Not as many as I would have thought. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=33)   Well, Shakti is a Sanskrit word meaning energy, and pat means to fall or confer. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=48)   So Shaktipat is a sort of zap of energy that you get from a teacher, often within a Hindu 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=56)   context, but I think it could be generalized from that. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=64)   Usually done in some sort of ritualized way. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=70)   The most famous example would be students come and the teacher touches them with a peacock 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=78)   feather or something like this, puts their hand on them, looks at them, does something 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=84)   to cause Shakti to arise within that person. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=90)   So the question is, is there Shaktipat in Buddhism? 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=94)   And that actually can be answered in a whole bunch of different ways. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=102)   First of all, Shakti is related to Kundalini Shakti. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=109)   So where does that fit in Buddhism? 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=113)   Where does this energy, which is sometimes expressed in terms of heat, sometimes expressed 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=124)   in terms of a movement of the spine and so forth, where does this notion fit in terms 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=133)   of Buddhist practice? 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=136)   Well, the simple explanation is, it's an aspect of what I call flow. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=147)   And what I call flow is just my way of talking about impermanence. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=152)   So there's two ways that people can relate to impermanence. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=160)   One is, well, it's what happens when you bring a lot of concentration, clarity and equanimity 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=166)   to ordinary sensory experiences. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=170)   Then they present themselves in a wave paradigm as opposed to a particle paradigm. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=177)   So there is no special energy separate from any ordinary experience. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=185)   In other words, the so-called materiality of the world, the carnality of one's body, 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=195)   the somethingness of one's mind, all of these just turn out to be what happens when you 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=206)   don't have a complete experience of seeing, hearing and feeling. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=211)   And when you have a complete experience, which is just another way to say, have a very clear, 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=217)   concentrated and equanimous experience, when you have a mindful experience, in other words, 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=225)   beyond a certain critical value of mindfulness, those ordinary experiences become extraordinary. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=235)   They show you their wave nature as opposed to their particle somethingness nature. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=242)   So there's no energy separate from what is ordinary. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=247)   Or a metaphor that might be taken from Einstein is he said that matter is just frozen energy. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=257)   So ordinary sensory experience, inner and outer seeing, inner and outer hearing, inner 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=263)   and outer body, that's just flow, that's just energy that has been coagulated by what? 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=276)   Well, it's been coagulated by incomplete experiencing of it. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=283)   The other way to relate to the energy thing is that there's this energy and then there 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=288)   is, in contrast to that, the material world. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=294)   And then the goal is to somehow get beyond the material world and to get to this energy 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=301)   which is desirable. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=304)   And that leads to a rather different paradigm, which is that, well, there are ways of manipulating 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=314)   this energy and causing this energy to be transferred and enhancing it and so forth. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=321)   So certain traditions like Kundalini Yoga, Qi Gong, Nei Gong in China and so forth, they 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=331)   sort of work from a perspective of, well, there's this thing called Shakti, there's 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=337)   this thing called Qi, it's this energy thing and we cultivate it, we manipulate it, we 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=344)   work with it and make it stronger and stronger and we can actually use it for doing stuff. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=351)   That's one paradigm. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=352)   And I think that's a legitimate paradigm. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=356)   There's nothing wrong with that. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=358)   Then there is the paradigm that I would use, which is that there's sensory experience and 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=366)   Qi equals MC squared. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=368)   So by fully experiencing the materiality of things, the non-materiality becomes evident. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=382)   Now there's nothing to say that a person couldn't work within both of these paradigms. 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=389)   I was once at a conference of Western teachers with the Dalai Lama and someone asked about 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=395)   mixing practices because a lot of Western Buddhists and a lot of Western Buddhist teachers 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=404)   have more than one lineage that has influenced them. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=409)   So the question was put to His Holiness the Dalai Lama and he said, well, it's okay, but 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=415)   you just, when you do one practice, you do that practice and in the afternoon if you 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=419)   do some other practice, then you do that practice. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=424)   So as long as you can understand the complementarity of them and use each system as its own system, 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=434)   then that's okay. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=436)   So there's nothing to say that you couldn't do Kundalini yoga or Qigong, which involves 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=442)   manipulating the quote energy, and also do Vipassana, where you're simply paying attention 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=450)   to what is and if flow becomes evident, you have the option to pay attention to it. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=456)   And yes, indeed, the more you pay attention to it, the more prominent it becomes. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=461)   That does tend to create a feedback loop in that way. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=467)   So Shakti, so now we know the Shakti part, what that means. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=474)   So is there transference of energy from a teacher to a student in Buddhism? 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=485)   And the fact is, in Tibetan Buddhism, yeah, big time. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=490)   And it's formalized as initiations and there are whole ceremonies built around it and so 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=499)   forth. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=500)   So yes, there certainly is that structure within certain parts of the Buddhist world. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=509)   But what I like more is the way Shakti part is done in the Zen tradition, at least in 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=517)   Rinzai Zen. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=518)   I'm not that familiar with Soto Zen. 
<br>[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=521)   Soto Zen is a little different. 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=524)   In Soto Zen, the Roshi sits with you, and in Soto Zen, you face the wall, but the Roshi 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=540)   faces out and sees everyone. 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=544)   So that means everyone that's fidgeting or doing whatever, it's eyes open practice, right? 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=551)   Now I guess in some sense, maybe this is a little bit of a Buddhist guilt trip. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=555)   It's like, maybe you're not going to fidget so much because you know you're impacting 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=562)   on the Roshi's see out. 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=566)   But you get uncomfortable enough and lost in your own misery, pretty soon, I don't think 
<br>[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=572)   that guilt trip really helps very much. 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=578)   People do move and fidget and whatever. 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=580)   And so the gift of the Soto Zen Roshi's is that they just take in all of that and metabolize 
<br>[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=589)   it as part of their sitting. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=593)   But it's done in the Zen Do because that, but the cool thing is you've actually got 
<br>[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=598)   not just a Roshi, but maybe a bunch of Roshi's sitting with you in the Zen Do. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=604)   In Rinzai Zen, as far as I've ever experienced it, the Roshi doesn't go to the Zen Do. 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=610)   You go to the Roshi, but you have one on one interactions in which you are given koans, 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=618)   which you've all heard about and I've talked about. 
<br>[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=623)   So that one on one interaction with the Roshi is in fact Shaktipat, but it's never talked 
<br>[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=633)   about that way. 
<br>[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=636)   You either catch on or you don't. 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=641)   So in the interaction while you're on the surface seemingly working on this koan, at 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=652)   the depths that master is grabbing your belly button. 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=658)   And how do they do that? 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=660)   Well, some of you may remember the teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda. 
<br>[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=671)   So it's about this anthropologist from UCLA that goes to Arizona and starts to work with 
<br>[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=678)   this Yati Indian and loses all objectivity and gets sucked into that culture's way of 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=692)   experiencing things. 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=693)   And this is true. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=694)   It actually happened. 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=695)   It's like a really interesting and cool story. 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=701)   So in the first book, at one point, this anthropologist, Carlos, asks Don Juan, which is the fictitious 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=712)   name of the Yati shaman that he worked with, whenever I'm around you, all this weird shit 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=721)   happens. 
<br>[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=724)   What is it? 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=728)   And he said, you're just seeing the power of my not doing. 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=736)   Now when I read that, I understood. 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=740)   I don't think the anthropologist understood. 
<br>[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=743)   Not at that time. 
<br>[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=744)   It was just another mysterious, weird thing that this guy said. 
<br>[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=750)   You're just seeing the power of my not doing. 
<br>[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=753)   Those Roshis, they don't do anything to grab your belly button. 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=759)   In fact, it's the opposite. 
<br>[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=763)   It's their emptiness that's grabbing you. 
<br>[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=767)   Their pure doingness. 
<br>[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=769)   The fact that they are a flow, whether they're laughing or whether they're bawling you out, 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=777)   it's just wind of nature. 
<br>[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=785)   You pick up on their body language, you pick up on all of those things, and that is indeed 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=792)   Shakti. 
<br>[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=793)   See, that's sort of the difference between Vipassana and Zen. 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=797)   There's a lot of differences. 
<br>[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=798)   I mean, obviously they come from different cultures, historically, etc. 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=804)   But practice-wise, a gross oversimplification would be that in Vipassana you observe sensory 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=820)   experience until you realize its impermanent nature. 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=830)   Maybe that's as far as you go, or maybe if you're lucky, you go beyond that to not only 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=838)   experience the senses as flow, but to actually ride on the flow, meaning that the bounciness 
<br>[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=847)   of the void starts to speak through you and move your arms and so forth. 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=856)   You might say that that's impermanence affecting the motor output in addition to the sensory 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=864)   input. 
<br>[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=866)   So in Vipassana you work with the sensory input, and some Vipassana teachers it affects 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=873)   their motor output and they have that bouncy, liberated quality that you get in Zen. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=880)   But other Vipassana teachers it doesn't affect the motor output and they're more inert, I 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=886)   guess would be the way to put it. 
<br>[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=889)   Whereas in Zen, this is like, once again, don't get me wrong, this is a gross oversimplification, 
<br>[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=897)   but in Zen they first train you to, they train your motor circuits into how to flow with 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=903)   impermanence. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=904)   It's the Zen schedule. 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=905)   And it's the whole energy of the interaction that you have with the Roshi, who's like moving 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=911)   in certain ways and then you find yourself moving in those ways. 
<br>[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=914)   So you're sort of training your output to flow with expansion and contraction, and then 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=920)   hopefully at some point it will go beyond your motor circuits and start to infect your 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=929)   perceptions of self and world so that your senses begin to flow with expansion and contraction 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=935)   and you get liberation. 
<br>[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=937)   So it's almost like they do the same task but in opposite order to a certain extent. 
<br>[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=949)   So that for me is a kind of Shaktipat because the Roshi is conveying the activity of emptiness, 
<br>[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=958)   the Buddha nature, the activity of impermanence to you. 
<br>[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=964)   And it's not talked about but if you know how to pick up on it, then you carry that 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=974)   with you back into the Zen dome. 
<br>[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=978)   So the difference with this kind of Shaktipat versus the Hindu formalized ceremonies or 
<br>[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=985)   the Tibetan formalized ceremonies, the difference is first of all it's not talked about that 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=991)   way. 
<br>[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=992)   You either pick up on it or you don't. 
<br>[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=995)   And there's no formalized ceremony, ostensibly it's just you interacting with this weird 
<br>[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1000)   person and doing these weird things. 
<br>[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1012)   So I like that because there's not all this, I don't know, specialness about it or what 
<br>[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1022)   have you. 
<br>[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1025)   But what I really like about it and once again what represents a very significant difference 
<br>[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1035)   from say the normal Shaktipat thing that you get from some Baba, okay. 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1042)   I'm not dissing it, I'm just trying to describe the situation. 
<br>[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1050)   Normally what's going to happen, you get your Shaktipat from the Baba and then what happens 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1054)   after that? 
<br>[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1055)   Well you all eat prasad, you sit around, you chant bhajans and everybody feels great and 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1061)   you all talk about how great the Guru is and then you leave and when you need your next 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1071)   fix you come for your next fix. 
<br>[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1075)   However in the Zen formal Shaktipat you go in, you have this incredible experience with 
<br>[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1079)   the Roshi and then what? 
<br>[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1083)   Then you go back to the Zen and if it's in the winter it's not heated and it is freaking 
<br>[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1088)   cold. 
<br>[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1089)   If it's in the summer there's no fan and there's mosquitoes and it's hot and you just want 
<br>[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1096)   to sleep but they'll beat you and yell at you and essentially you're going back to the 
<br>[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1102)   samurai torture chamber. 
<br>[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1106)   And there you get to test to what extent you have truly metabolized the Shakti. 
<br>[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1115)   And you now apply it to the samurai torture chamber. 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1122)   So that the goal here is to create equals, not disciples. 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1131)   Every Guru worth his mala should want equals, not disciples. 
<br>[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1138)   For real, not lip service, for real. 
<br>[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1142)   In fact as I implied yesterday every Guru worth his mala or her mala should want students 
<br>[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1151)   that are better than them. 
<br>[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1154)   End of story. 
<br>[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1156)   So that form of Shaktipat you got to use it. 
<br>[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1160)   You got to use it for something real, aching legs, sleepy head, emotions running up the 
<br>[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1167)   yin yang because you're being abused all day and it's pushing every button that can be 
<br>[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1174)   pushed. 
<br>[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1175)   Okay, now how real is that Shakti? 
<br>[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1178)   Can you experience that as flow? 
<br>[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1182)   And that's how that Roshi got to be the way they are and so it goes. 
<br>[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1188)   So yes, there's that kind of Shaktipat in Buddhism. 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1195)   And then there's the daily Shaktipat that we all have now, don't we? 
<br>[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1202)   Because we're always sharing energy with each other. 
<br>[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1206)   Everyone. 
<br>[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1207)   To the extent that a person has a practice to that extent the people around them pick 
<br>[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1213)   up on that. 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1218)   And so you're all giving Shaktipat to other people whether you're aware of it or not. 
<br>[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1223)   It may not be as powerful because number one, people don't necessarily have the expectation 
<br>[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1230)   and the expectation is of course a big part of it. 
<br>[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1235)   And number two, well your Shakti might not be quite as intense as someone that's meditated 
<br>[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1243)   80 years in a monastic training but you got something, okay. 
<br>[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1249)   And you're also getting Shaktipat from other people. 
<br>[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1254)   And in fact, this is going to sound a little weird but you get it from animals who very 
<br>[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1260)   much are in the flow and you get it from your children until they develop a talking self. 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1271)   In the first few years of life, what does infant, infant in English, infance from the 
<br>[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1278)   Latin infance, which is the present participle of fari which means to speak. 
<br>[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1287)   Same root as confabulate and so forth. 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1290)   So the infant is the one that doesn't speak yet. 
<br>[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1294)   Has not acquired external language, has not presumably acquired internal language but 
<br>[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1300)   there's a certain magic period there where the, when you're attending to a neonate and 
<br>[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1309)   so forth or I don't know how far the magic extends on average but you know probably, 
<br>[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1319)   you know the first year at least, where basically your infant, your child is a Roshi. 
<br>[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1330)   They are just space expanding and contracting. 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1335)   And if that's then parenting, every time you take care of a baby, I think nature intends 
<br>[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1342)   that to be a sunset, a Shaktipat for the parent to recharge their batteries which are strained 
<br>[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1354)   to the max by the parenting endeavor. 
<br>[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1359)   So that's, you know, there's that. 
<br>[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1364)   Yeah it's interesting about the no self, the not doing, this is a really weird story. 
<br>[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1374)   Okay, they tell me that I'm supposed to tell stories. 
<br>[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1379)   So that's supposed to make a good Dharma talk. 
<br>[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1385)   This is a true story. 
<br>[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1388)   So many years ago I was driving through Santa Monica with a student of mine who has since 
<br>[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1399)   passed away. 
<br>[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1400)   I don't know if any of you remember about Martinez but anyway, this is way back there. 
<br>[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1408)   So we were driving in Santa Monica and we had this weird psychic experience. 
<br>[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1420)   It was like a truly psychic experience. 
<br>[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1424)   So we're driving down the street and we both started to look at this homeless person who 
<br>[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1432)   was, they were just on the street corner and it was evident that there was some mental 
<br>[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1444)   illness there. 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1447)   But they were just sort of like, you know, just sort of like moving, okay. 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1458)   And we looked at this guy and we looked at each other and we knew that we had had exactly 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1463)   the same thought and it was true. 
<br>[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1468)   And the thought was if you clean this guy up, put white robes, put him in front of a 
<br>[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1476)   group of people and don't let him say anything, people would have Shaktipat. 
<br>[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1484)   And that's a fairly complicated thought. 
<br>[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1495)   Because there was just no self there. 
<br>[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1498)   He was just part of nature. 
<br>[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1503)   Now apropos of stories, years later I was at another student's house and so I see this 
<br>[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1531)   book and it's one of these like photo books, you know, that people would put on like a 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1539)   coffee table or whatever this was on, her piano. 
<br>[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1545)   And I'm hesitating now because I'm trying to remember the exact title of the book, unfortunately. 
<br>[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1553)   I don't plan these talks very much, so. 
<br>[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1561)   Okay anyway, it's a picture book. 
<br>[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1564)   It's just pictures. 
<br>[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1565)   It's like this huge book of photographs. 
<br>[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1570)   And I start to look through these photographs and what's interesting is that there's nothing 
<br>[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1577)   by the photographer, the person that's the author of the book. 
<br>[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1582)   There's nothing at all. 
<br>[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1583)   But what there is is an intro, a preamble by Toni Morrison. 
<br>[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1589)   Now that's a fairly important person in the world of art and literature and so forth. 
<br>[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1596)   So that tells you, well this is somehow a significant book. 
<br>[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1603)   But there's nothing by the person who actually took the photos. 
<br>[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1608)   This is anything about anything at all. 
<br>[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1610)   In other words, the photos have to speak for themselves. 
<br>[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1613)   This is big book, okay. 
<br>[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1616)   And I'm flipping through this book and I'm like freaking out because it's very evident 
<br>[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1626)   to me, these are all portraits by the way. 
<br>[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1630)   It's very evident to me what this book is about and that I had never seen a book like 
<br>[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1641)   this ever. 
<br>[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1646)   And so this is, I think some of you know Markel. 
<br>[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1653)   This is at Markel's house. 
<br>[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1656)   So anyway, I go to Markel and I say, but this book is amazing. 
<br>[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1661)   And she said, well, you know Bergman, the guy that wrote it or that photographed, I 
<br>[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1666)   guess we lost our power. 
<br>[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1669)   The photographer is a distant relative of mine. 
<br>[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1678)   So I say, well, can you get his telephone number? 
<br>[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1684)   He said, sure, I got his telephone number. 
<br>[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1688)   So we called him up and he was there. 
<br>[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1694)   And I said, I told him what I thought his book was about. 
<br>[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1700)   And he freaked out. 
<br>[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1704)   And he said that I was the only person who ever understood what the book was about. 
<br>[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1712)   Of all the people that, you want to check this out? 
<br>[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1717)   Of all the people that had seen it in exhibitions or whatever. 
<br>[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1722)   So now I'm sure you're quite curious as to what it's about. 
<br>[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1726)   Now, damn it, I don't want to get the title wrong. 
<br>[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1731)   Let me just see if I can find it. 
<br>[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1742)   You're surfing the web. 
<br>[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1743)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1744)   This is a good day and time. 
<br>[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1747)   Let's just try here. 
<br>[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1750)   I was going to do something else with the internet than this. 
<br>[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1757)   I'm very klutzy and slow. 
<br>[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1766)   I don't think that's going to work. 
<br>[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1781)   You got it working? 
<br>[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1782)   Okay. 
<br>[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1783)   Let's see if we find it. 
<br>[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1784)   Okay, I found it. 
<br>[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1785)   That's just amazing. 
<br>[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1798)   Here it is. 
<br>[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1799)   And that gave them time to get this fixed. 
<br>[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1812)   Untangle and be free. 
<br>[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1818)   People don't like the divide and conquer, so I gave them a more politically correct 
<br>[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1826)   way to say it. 
<br>[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1832)   So it is by Robert Bergman. 
<br>[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1839)   The name of the book is A Kind of Rapture. 
<br>[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1844)   So what it is, is he went through the rust belt of the United States, the old decaying 
<br>[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1856)   cities, photographing street people who for whatever reason, usually a combination of 
<br>[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1871)   a hard life and physical and mental illness, had been thrust into a no self state. 
<br>[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1882)   In other words, people for whom the blows of life had driven them to a no self, a rapturous 
<br>[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1897)   no self experience. 
<br>[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1899)   He went around the country looking for those kinds of people, catching them at the moment 
<br>[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1907)   where they manifested the non-ego that their hard life had taken them to. 
<br>[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1916)   And you get picture after picture after picture so that the message, you know, you see one 
<br>[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1923)   or two pictures like that, it doesn't have the same impact. 
<br>[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1928)   But if you see 50 pictures like that, then it hits you what the whole thing is about. 
<br>[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1938)   So the reason I thought it was so extraordinary is that although there's a lot of books about 
<br>[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1949)   enlightenment or no self coming about through practice, and there are a number of books 
<br>[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1955)   of people, written by people that have had spontaneous enlightenment experiences, what 
<br>[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1964)   no one's looked at is this whole thing, this whole other aspect. 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1970)   And so it's, in terms of its subject matter, it's very unusual. 
<br>[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1977)   And then in terms of the, so the message is very unusual and the medium is unusual. 
<br>[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1982)   Instead of writing a book talking about this phenomenon, he shows it to you. 
<br>[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1989)   And you either get it or you don't. 
<br>[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=1992)   So anyway, that's a whole other little riff, but apropos of where you might go for your 
<br>[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGmU1oVroLM&t=2000)   Shakti Paschal.
