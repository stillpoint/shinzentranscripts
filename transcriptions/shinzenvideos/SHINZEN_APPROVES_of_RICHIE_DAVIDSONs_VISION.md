title: "SHINZEN APPROVES of RICHIE DAVIDSON's VISION"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=0)   One of the main laboratories for affective neuroscience, neuroscience that is looking 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=17)   at human emotion, is also one of the main laboratories for contemplative neuroscience. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=27)   And both of those terms, affective neuroscience, the neuroscience of human emotion, and contemplative 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=34)   neuroscience, which is turning the lens of science towards contemplative experience, 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=40)   both those terms as far as I know were coined by the same person. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=44)   And that person's lab is one of the main places where this kind of research goes on. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=53)   And who is that person and where is that lab? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=57)   That's Richie Davidson at the University of Wisconsin, my alma mater actually. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=64)   I did my undergraduate work at UCLA in Asian languages, but I did Buddhist studies at the 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=70)   University of Wisconsin back in the day, when it was still weird to be interested in Buddhism. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=83)   But things were beginning to change. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=86)   So there was no contemplative neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin in 1970. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=94)   That's all of course much, much later, but there was Buddhist studies. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=99)   You want to know why the University of Wisconsin in my day was the premier location for the 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=109)   academic study of Buddhism? 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=111)   Well, it's like Wisconsin, why Wisconsin of all places? 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=116)   I mean, you might think Berkeley or Harvard or something. 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=120)   Why was the first PhD program in Buddhism at the University of Wisconsin? 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=125)   Well, it's a nice little example of what in Buddhism is called pratityasamutpada, the 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=133)   causal net, how this being that is, this being that is, this being that is, leads to some 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=141)   interesting consequences. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=145)   By the way, it was a magic time. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=150)   Let's see, I must have gone there in 68, I think, is when I, yeah, probably that's right. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=156)   1968, Madison, 68, right? 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=159)   Well, you know, it was crazy, right? 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=161)   I mean, it's like the Vietnam War was raging. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=167)   My Buddhist education, three years of graduate school, paid for by the DoD, the Department 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=177)   of Defense of the United States government. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=180)   Why? 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=183)   Why are they giving out like huge endowments to study Buddhism? 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=190)   Yeah, they realized there were political consequences to Buddhism in Southeast Asia. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=199)   Now there are political consequences to Islam, so there's lots of money if you want to study 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=204)   Arabic. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=205)   Well, there was a lot of money available if you wanted to study Buddhism. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=209)   So yeah, the Department of Defense paid for my PhD education in Buddhism. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=216)   And I paid them back by being in all sorts of anti-government demonstrations, which Madison 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=224)   was very famous for, if you know the history of the time. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=231)   It was pretty wild. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=232)   I mean, I didn't do violent stuff. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=234)   Some people got really violent, blew up one of the buildings on campus. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=239)   I don't know if you remember that history or whatever. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=242)   It's pretty crazy. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=245)   And I loved it. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=246)   And we got one of our people, a dope-smoking hippie elected mayor. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=253)   Yeah, it was a pretty interesting time. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=259)   And that's where you would get a PhD in Buddhist studies. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=266)   And now, if you look around, the people that are now retiring academics in the Buddhist 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=276)   field, those are the people I went to school with. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=281)   So I see these books published by this one and that one. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=285)   I remember he was really crappy in Sanskrit. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=288)   I had to help him out. 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=292)   It's sort of fun. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=294)   But I didn't go down an academic course. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=296)   I got shunted, as you know, into something else. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=300)   But I still have those sanskaras. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=302)   You guys have to put up with dozens of languages and all sorts of arcane factoids that I find 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=312)   amazingly interesting. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=314)   And it's probably pretty irrelevant to a lot of people. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=319)   So Madison, when I was there, there was no contemplative neuroscience. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=328)   But there was Buddhist studies. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=330)   So why Wisconsin? 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=335)   What arrows can you line up that point to Wisconsin, of all places, being the premier 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=343)   location for Buddhist studies? 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=347)   Just in North America. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=352)   Doesn't seem to quite compute. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=354)   So when you think of Wisconsin, besides the Green Bay Packers, what else do you think 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=360)   of? 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=361)   Cheese. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=362)   You think of cheese. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=365)   And why do you think of cheese? 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=368)   By the way, it is related to cheese. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=370)   Dairy. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=371)   Well, dairy. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=374)   Dairy is part of farming. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=376)   And the University of Wisconsin had the best agriculture programs. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=383)   It specialized in agriculture science. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=388)   Because big agriculture state. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=391)   So there was a science specialty in agriculture. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=399)   Now the country of India has had a perennial problem. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=407)   And that perennial problem is feeding itself. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=411)   So lots of people came over from India to study agriculture science at the University 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=420)   of Wisconsin. 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=422)   So now there's a general tendency in the academic world, if you have a lot of people from a 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=430)   certain region of the globe, for whatever reason, are coming to your university, well, 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=436)   it also sort of makes sense to have area studies for that region at that university. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=445)   Case in point, USC. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=450)   What is USC's specialty as far as area studies? 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=464)   Well it may be different now. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=468)   But in my day, USC was where you went for Islamic studies. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=474)   Middle Eastern. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=476)   Why? 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=477)   Because a lot of wealthy people in the Middle East could buy their way for their kids into 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=484)   USC. 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=486)   So you had a lot of people from the Middle East and you had a lot of money coming from 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=489)   the Middle East. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=490)   So there's big center for Islamic and Middle Eastern research, at least there was 30 years 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=497)   ago when I used to use the library there. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=500)   This big Islamic center. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=502)   So it made sense because we had a lot of people coming from India to the University of Wisconsin. 
<br>[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=508)   Well let's make Indian studies, not Indian in the sense of American Indian, but East 
<br>[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=514)   Indian. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=515)   So Indian studies. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=518)   Studies of Indic civilization. 
<br>[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=521)   And as people got interested in Buddhism, well that is a product of India, so Buddhist 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=528)   studies make sense at the University of Wisconsin because it has an area specialty in India. 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=535)   So yes, cheese is responsible ultimately for all of this esoterica, these weird languages 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=548)   that you have to endure me talking about. 
<br>[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=552)   Because I was in a PhD program for Buddhist studies. 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=557)   So anyway, now when we think of Wisconsin, we have affective neuroscience and contemplative 
<br>[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=565)   neuroscience. 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=566)   How cool is that? 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=567)   And that's Richie, Richie Davidson. 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=570)   And some of you actually know him pretty well. 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=574)   Most of you know him by reputation. 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=579)   So the first time I ever visited Richie, the first thing he laid on me when he was showing 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=584)   me around his lab, which wasn't nearly as big as it is now because the Dalai Lama gave 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=590)   him a couple million dollars. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=593)   They're really doing pretty good, but he still had a pretty substantial, he had a whole building. 
<br>[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=599)   And he was showing me around and he laid out this vision that he had for what his graduate 
<br>[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=608)   program in neuroscience would be. 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=612)   And the phrase he used was a science sangha. 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=617)   Science sangha, a nice, yeah, a community of meditation practitioners who were also 
<br>[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=626)   scientists. 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=629)   So I don't know if it was required, but certainly everyone that I knew that studied, that was 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=638)   a neuroscientist in Richie's program was also a meditator. 
<br>[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=646)   And the idea being that it's not just, well, we need to understand these experiences, so 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=653)   we have to meditate. 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=655)   But his idea was that this is going to make us better people and specifically better scientists. 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=664)   So that's a model right there. 
<br>[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=669)   It's actually happening. 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=673)   Something that meditation can bring. 
<br>[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=676)   If I didn't have all these other responsibilities, if I had a lot of spare time, what I would 
<br>[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=686)   probably do is develop meditation courses specifically aimed at geeks and scientists. 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=697)   Yeah, it's like, just bring that in. 
<br>[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=703)   So that's something that enlightenment or meditation can give to science that will help 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvq5CkWSn5A&t=718)   science do its job better. 
<br>
