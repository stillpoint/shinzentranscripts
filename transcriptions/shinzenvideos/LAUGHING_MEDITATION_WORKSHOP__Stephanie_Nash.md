title: "LAUGHING MEDITATION WORKSHOP ~ Stephanie Nash"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=0)   I'm pumped, and then you'll see me cupped in. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=12)   What I didn't get a chance to do last time, because we were in the Zen Do, and it was 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=17)   a formal meditation, so I didn't get a chance to really introduce this, or give some exercises, 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=23)   or a certain way of kind of working with it, practically. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=27)   So I wanted to take advantage of this to do that. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=32)   Laughing as you know, is like a universal language, it doesn't matter where in the world 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=36)   you are, everybody knows what that is. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=39)   We all share that, as human beings. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=42)   And laughing muscles, by the way, it's the same as crying, right? 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=46)   It uses the diaphragm the same way. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=47)   And I'll talk about that in a second. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=48)   And oh, see, I have my whole iPad, but then it goes off, and then I see my cute puppy 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=55)   there. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=56)   And it's used, I mentioned, for therapy, when my mom got cancer, they told her to laugh. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=62)   I've used it with people who've been locked into depression, for you facilitators. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=68)   Especially any emotion, but especially depression, because anger and fear have an energy to them, 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=73)   and depression doesn't, and there's a dynamic energy that can happen here, that can suddenly 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=79)   shift a habit of this and go, oh, I see, my energy can go a different way. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=84)   So that's a practical use of it. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=88)   Physiologically, some people, body functionings get better, digestion, things like that. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=93)   You're massaging, right, all sorts of internal organs. 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=97)   And of course, flow is better than a single digit integer, greater than one in my thought. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=104)   I thought I'd say it. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=106)   Okay, so it's something that we can practice, and just like concentration, sensory clarity, 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=112)   and equanimity, we practice them here so that our lives get better, not so that we're really 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=117)   good with our eyes closed, right? 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=119)   So laughing is something that you can practice and stretch like a muscle, and then in your 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=124)   life, there's more of a chance that things will be funnier, or it can literally open 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=130)   muscles. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=132)   I'm going to talk about how actors work with their instrument, their bodies, their instrument. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=138)   And you want your instrument, you want it to be open to any possible choice of an impulse 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=144)   that may happen in a moment. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=145)   So you have to stretch the body in certain ways. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=148)   And if you want to play the Queen of England, hanging out like this doesn't quite do it. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=152)   So you kind of got to work with that. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=154)   You got to play someone who's frightened all the time. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=157)   Just kind of bringing the body like this might help. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=159)   If you're playing somebody who laughs all the time, just kind of hanging out like this 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=163)   and looking around, it just kind of changes how you see the world. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=167)   So you can just kind of play with how the body can affect your emotions. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=174)   And that's something that I just want to mention, that laughter is a subset of this bigger category 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=184)   of the physicality of the body and how it can affect our mind and our emotions. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=191)   And I just gave examples of ways to hold the body, but in acting, for example, there is 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=197)   a way if I want to create somebody who's fearful, I could just hold the body like this without 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=204)   any thinking and those feelings can come up. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=207)   Right? 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=208)   If I want to be confident, I can do Wonder Woman, right? 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=211)   Or whatever. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=212)   And those feelings. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=215)   So I just want to mention this as an aside to meditators, because I first started teaching 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=221)   something called body unlocking, and laughing was a small part of it, but where people, 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=226)   I'd hear the reports at retreats of these great insights into, okay, let's use fear, 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=232)   of an insight into, oh, wow, I have that response. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=236)   People really doing some deep processing and experiencing this freedom, and then they get 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=241)   up off the cushion and the body goes back into this. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=244)   And they say, I don't know why, but I keep getting those fearful thoughts, or that those 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=249)   fearful feelings keep coming up, and I kind of want to say, well, that's kind of an engraved 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=253)   invitation. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=255)   That's how we create them, as actors. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=258)   Right? 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=259)   So I just want to throw that in, and that's what I do on the outside, is kind of this 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=265)   getting the body kind of, so that it's supportive to the internal process. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=270)   Here we work with mental image and internal talk. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=273)   We have the body posture in sitting practice or walking practice, but we don't really deal 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=280)   with this other part of it. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=281)   So I just want to throw that in there, since laughter is a subset of that, although laughter 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=286)   is unique unto itself, because it is not just a way we hold the body, it's a dynamic expression 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=295)   of sensory feeling, and it uses breathing and breath in a very dynamic way. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=302)   And I'm sorry I didn't wait for everybody, but I'm recording it, so you can always keep 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=308)   playing. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=309)   Does that make sense, what I just said? 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=312)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=313)   Cool. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=314)   All right. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=315)   So, oh, okay, that was all I had to say that I had notes for. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=319)   All right, so what I wanted to do was mention two techniques that two master teachers, one 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=326)   an acting teacher, one a meditation teacher, have used to kind of help goose people into 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=336)   big laughter in a certain kind of way. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=338)   And then when I do laughing meditation, I don't try to goose people into big laughter, 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=342)   I just let whatever arises, arises, and just the sound of someone with a silly laugh can 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=347)   get you going, as we've discovered last time. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=351)   But I wanted to use what they present as a kind of warm-up for us in that stretching, 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=359)   because it uses a dynamic use of breath. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=362)   So first is a master acting teacher, when I was at the Yale School of Drama, and we 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=366)   had our check-off class, and everything you hear Shinzen say about Roshi kind of applies 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=373)   here. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=374)   And someone would do something, he'd say, no, laugh! 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=377)   And she'd go, I thought I was laughing. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=379)   And he'd say, no, and he'd slap his hand on the table, and he'd let all the air out of 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=385)   his body, and then make whatever sound was whatever left that sounded like the end of 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=392)   a big laugh, and then you had to gasp for air coming in, and then he would continue 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=398)   expanding and contracting in this uncontrollable laughter, as we just kind of stunned watched 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=403)   him and then realized later we were laughing too. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=408)   His name is Earl Gister, and I do this today in honor of him, because right after I studied 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=414)   with him, he lost his voice and has a voice box with throat cancer. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=418)   So this is in honor of sharing with other people who can't hear him anymore what he 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=425)   gave us. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=426)   So I have to sit because he sat when he did it. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=430)   But I will demonstrate what he did, and we can try it as an exercise for 30 seconds. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=436)   He would slap this, let all the air out, and go. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=440)   And I've been in silence, and I haven't done this in probably 15 years, 20, but we'll just 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=446)   see how it goes. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=447)   Now that was a technical use of pushing out air, just letting whatever's out there. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=476)   And I thought, just as an exercise, this isn't our laughing meditation, this is a warm up. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=488)   So if you would like to try it with me now, you can feel free to slap if you'd like to. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=501)   But, just try it. 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=507)   But, this is for spending, really. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=515)   Breathe. 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=517)   That's good. 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=520)   What do you wanna do? 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=528)   So you get the feel of how that just kind of, right? 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=535)   You can see how you just get kind of warmed up and then you can't even talk anymore. 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=542)   Alright, so, Nicola Geiger. How many people here knew Nicola? 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=547)   Okay, for those who didn't, she was one of Shinzon's first teacher. 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=553)   And often refers to her as the first functioning bodhisattva that he ever knew 
<br>[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=558)   because she welcomed mobsters and monks alike. 
<br>[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=563)   And she would come to retreats, she's a big German woman, 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=567)   she went through Germany during a difficult time and was part of a white rose movement. 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=574)   She'd come to retreats and she'd have her cane and she had a laugh that would make Santa jealous. 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=580)   And she would say basically, and now my dear, it is time for a laughing meditation. 
<br>[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=586)   You know, she would just kind of, does that kind of sound Nicola-esque? 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=590)   Right, she'd say, hello my dear. Right? 
<br>[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=595)   And so she, we were talking, I was having a private session with her one time 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=604)   and I didn't know about, I'd never seen her do a laughing meditation. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=609)   I told her how I was using laughing in performances and things. 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=613)   I thought it shifted people's energy to always put it in. 
<br>[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=616)   And she'd say, I'm going to show you how to do a laughing meditation. 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=621)   And then she had a very technical way of doing it. 
<br>[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=625)   Now once again, I'll kind of give you a little taste of what it is. 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=629)   I cannot do Nicola's laugh. I just don't have the mechanics for that. 
<br>[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=636)   But I will give what she taught me. 
<br>[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=639)   I took notes. I haven't looked at them since she taught me, what, seven years ago or however long it was. 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=644)   I don't know. 
<br>[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=645)   So she had, it went ho ho ha ha ha. 
<br>[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=650)   Okay? 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=651)   And she would have us clap or she would use her cane. 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=655)   But it would be ho ho ha ha ha. It would be like that. 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=660)   And so she'd start, you'd get through about three of those before you go home. 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=665)   So it would be something like, to do it without you guys makes it a little bit of a performance. 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=673)   So I'm just really trying to do Nicola's laughing meditation. 
<br>[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=676)   I'm visually visioning her here. 
<br>[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=678)   So it would be, okay my dear. 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=682)   Ho ho ha ha ha. Ho ho ha ha ha. Ho ho ha ha ha. Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ha ha ha ha ha. 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=692)   Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=694)   And she'd do that whole big laugh. 
<br>[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=696)   Right? 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=697)   And then we'd go off because just listening to her laugh once again made you, 
<br>[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=702)   I'm not a ho ho ha ha kind of, you know, I go more hee hee. 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=707)   You can add a hee hee. Hee hee. Ha ha ho ho. 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=712)   Okay? 
<br>[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=713)   So just in honor of Nicola, who is no longer with us, but today we honor her as well. 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=719)   And you don't have to clap, but she insisted I do. 
<br>[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=723)   So you must clap, would be what she would say, something like that. 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=728)   And then of course when you're done you ring the bell, you know. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=733)   Yes, she would do that. You wouldn't be able to do it without ringing the bell. 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=736)   So we'll ring the bell. 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=738)   Ding. 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=740)   Ha. 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=746)   Ready my dear? 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=749)   Ho ho ha ha ha ho ho ho ha ha ho. 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=756)   Ho ho ho ho ho ho ha ho ho. 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=760)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=762)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=764)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=766)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=768)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=770)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=772)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=774)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=776)   Oh! 
<br>[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=778)   Oh! 
<br>[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=780)   Oh! 
<br>[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=782)   Oh! 
<br>[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=784)   Okay! Are we warmed up now? 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=786)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=788)   Are we warmed up? 
<br>[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=790)   Okay. 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=792)   Yes, my down. 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=794)   So, that was Nikola. 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=796)   So, those of you who have heard her, that would sound familiar, right? 
<br>[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=798)   Okay, let's do a laugh. 
<br>[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=800)   Okay, and then, 
<br>[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=802)   I don't know what's going to happen, because whenever we do a laugh in meditation, 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=804)   I don't know. It's usually, 
<br>[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=806)   I'll do it at the end of a set. 
<br>[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=808)   You know, the way people do meta. 
<br>[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=810)   Maybe if 
<br>[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=812)   we've gone through a lot of focus on 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=814)   feel into dark places, 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=816)   if I've guided something, it would change 
<br>[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=818)   the whole energy in the room. 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=820)   I might do it before we, I want people to work with flow. 
<br>[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=822)   Tune into your bodies 
<br>[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=824)   right now, just from doing that. 
<br>[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=826)   Feel any flow? 
<br>[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=828)   Okay, that was less than 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=830)   60 seconds of laughing. 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=832)   Right? 
<br>[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=834)   So, I'm now going to guide, 
<br>[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=836)   oh, and so, when I guide, 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=838)   it's a nice closed practice. 
<br>[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=840)   If you want to open your eyes, 
<br>[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=842)   just like any practice, open or close as you will, 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=844)   but I find there's, 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=846)   actually, someone told me 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=848)   that there's only so much real estate in consciousness. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=850)   And, you know, 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=852)   and then he'll say 
<br>[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=854)   as emotions expand, 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=856)   IQ contracts, but 
<br>[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=858)   what I'm going to say is, 
<br>[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=860)   it's like with eating meditation, 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=862)   you close your eyes and you can taste more. 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=864)   So, in the same way you close your eyes, 
<br>[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=866)   you can really tune into the feel 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=868)   and the flow, 
<br>[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=870)   and it'll be a focus in, focus out, 
<br>[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=872)   focus on sound, 
<br>[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=874)   and some people 
<br>[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=876)   get a lot of image, 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=878)   I get none. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=880)   It's just, it's a 
<br>[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=882)   total other thing for me, but, 
<br>[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=884)   you know, you now have 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=886)   plenty of techniques. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=888)   So, go wild. 
<br>[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=890)   So, what we're going to do 
<br>[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=892)   is you're going to close your eyes 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=894)   and I will guide it 
<br>[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=896)   in the air, okay? 
<br>[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=902)   So, we're now going to do a meditation. 
<br>[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=931)   A meditation called a laughing meditation. 
<br>[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=938)   And laughing is optional. 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=942)   And feel free to jump in at any time, 
<br>[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=945)   but I will give some guidance. 
<br>[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=951)   Maybe I won't. 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=980)   Feel free to slap your hand if you want. 
<br>[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1009)   Feel free to laugh. 
<br>[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1024)   Feel free to laugh. 
<br>[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1043)   Feel free to laugh. 
<br>[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1058)   Feel free to laugh. 
<br>[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1073)   Feel free to laugh. 
<br>[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1088)   Feel free to laugh. 
<br>[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1107)   And whether you're laughing or not, 
<br>[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1110)   you can tune in to expansion 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1112)   and contraction, 
<br>[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1115)   and relaxation. 
<br>[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1120)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1147)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1176)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1201)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1229)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1258)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1272)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1300)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1310)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1330)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1340)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1360)   Feel, feel, feel. 
<br>[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1376)   It's a good abdominal workout. 
<br>[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1380)   Did you guys laugh? 
<br>[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1385)   I did. 
<br>[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1388)   Take a nice deep pleasure. 
<br>[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1390)   We'll sigh every day. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1391)   Big breath in. 
<br>[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1397)   We need another one. 
<br>[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1398)   Okay. 
<br>[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1399)   Big breath in. 
<br>[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1410)   That was 10 minutes. 
<br>[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1412)   Okay. 
<br>[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1416)   In honor of all laughing meditation people everywhere. 
<br>[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1423)   Okay, so close your eyes and tune in to your body. 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1425)   What's going on? 
<br>[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1429)   And if sounds happen, 
<br>[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1430)   it's just like the laughter shocks, right? 
<br>[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1432)   So, you know, if you have to laugh, laugh. 
<br>[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1436)   But just really tune in and feel the flow. 
<br>[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1440)   Where are you feeling? 
<br>[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1443)   Anything that wants to spread, let it. 
<br>[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1449)   Open to the massage from the inside through the body. 
<br>[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1457)   What's the face feel like? 
<br>[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1462)   Belly, hands, feet. 
<br>[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1491)   It's very serious. 
<br>[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1494)   Very serious. 
<br>[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1511)   And hear the sounds of laughter. 
<br>[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1513)   Other people's laughter, you can feel it on your body. 
<br>[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1544)   Other people's laughter. 
<br>[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1588)   No, spirit, stop it! 
<br>[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1592)  ización 
<br>[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1596)   no 
<br>[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1600)   mi vida

<br>[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1605)   I'm so sorry. 
<br>[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1620)   As much as it pains me to do this. 
<br>[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1628)   The next time she shoots it, it's a film. 
<br>[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1631)   Don't let me let you stop laughing. 
<br>[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1635)   And my prescription for life, if you do ten minutes of this a day, no problem. 
<br>[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6BOMjafBI&t=1643)   You know, you can pepper your day.
