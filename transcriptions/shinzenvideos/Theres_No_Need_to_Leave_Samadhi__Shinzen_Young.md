title: "There's No Need to Leave Samadhi ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=0)   I was talking about when I first learned how to practice. My first teacher was this like 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=17)   samurai actually. He was really macho in the way he talked. He was the president of the sumo club. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=34)   I mean he wasn't himself built like that but the sumo club are the students at the university that 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=41)   do sumo and he was the advisor. Usually those kinds of people are sort of quasi militaristic 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=49)   types you know get into the martial arts and things like that. So what he would do is when 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=55)   at the end of each set you know ring the bell to end the set. Just before you ring the bell 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=61)   you'd be sitting there for an hour right. It was Zen you know it was the whole Zen thing. Although 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=67)   he was a Shingon monk by lineage but he trained in the Zen tradition. Just before he'd hit the 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=75)   bell he'd deliver like some sort of one-line zinger sound bite and then like hit the bell you 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=88)   know. It was like really dramatic and it would and because you're in the really deep state you 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=93)   know it's like it's brainwashing right. You're being indoctrinated because it really hits you 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=100)   right. So I remember but it's good brainwashing. I'm very grateful that I had that. So I remember 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=107)   once it was like we're all sitting on this. But what it means is the samadhi that you go into 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=135)   and come out of is not samadhi. Meaning so took me years to really understand. I thought I understood 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=145)   what he meant but I didn't really understand what he meant. I thought what he meant is okay 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=150)   stay in these states all the time which is true. I mean that's part of what he meant. But the deeper 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=155)   understanding is that when you're in a certain state and it's time to start taking care of 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=171)   business whatever business is. Go to the washroom or drive to work or you know make breakfast. You're 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=179)   in this something and now it's time to act. The tendency is to want to in some way go back to the 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=191)   normal way of being and then okay I'm gonna function. It's like okay well that was that was 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=198)   great but now let's get back to the real world. And the trick is to just not do that. Whatever 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=208)   function needs to arise simply happens from that state. You channel whatever doing needs to be done 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=218)   and if that causes fear or disorientation you equanimize it and you throw caution to the wind 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=229)   and you just function. And that's one of the ways that that Zen bounce is trained. So I would say 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=236)   when that happens if you have to transition to some action, fine just you know you don't leave, 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=252)   you may come out of Samadhi but you don't need to leave Samadhi in order to function. And if you 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=261)   come out, why do you come out? You come out because the inner system reactivates and if you see where 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=274)   that reactivation comes from you actually see the self being born from the non-self. Then you're 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=286)   just fine. There's no difficulties whatsoever in integrating. I don't know if that was what you 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ibaMe6oi2g&t=297)   were asking about. Okay I think we're good for now.
