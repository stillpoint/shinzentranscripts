<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=0)   How did you get into Buddhism? 
<br>[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=6)   Okay, so, let's see here. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=15)   How I went from being a monk to a non-Buddhist, 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=24)   and how I worked through my various issues on the cushion. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=28)   Who gave me this question? 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=32)   Don't be embarrassed. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=34)   At which issues were you thinking of? 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=37)   That could be several Dharma talks. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=41)   I think you were a pig. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=44)   A pig one. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=46)   Well, now that's interesting. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=48)   We have these teachers' meetings, 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=53)   where the Western Buddhist teachers, 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=55)   meaning the people teaching Buddhism in the West, 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=59)   nothing to do with your ethnic origin, 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=62)   the so-called Western Buddhist teachers, 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=66)   we have these periodic meetings. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=69)   Next one is going to be in two years, in 2015. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=75)   And in the past it's been 200, 250, 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=81)   it's probably going to be twice as big next time. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=83)   It's awesome. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=85)   These are all full-time teachers. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=89)   So, we had this meeting, as we do from time to time, 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=98)   and they took us through an interesting process 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=104)   called crossing the line. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=108)   Anybody here know what this is? 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=110)   I see only like two or three people. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=115)   That's interesting. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=117)   I had never seen it. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=119)   I don't know what is its origin. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=121)   I mean, I don't know. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=124)   What would you even call it? 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=126)   It's an empathy builder? 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=130)   So, what they do is, 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=133)   you've got this huge group of people, 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=135)   and they put a line in the middle of the room. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=142)   And then everybody is on one side of the room. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=148)   And then they call out different ways 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=157)   that people could be characterized. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=159)   In fact, the whole range of things. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=169)   Now, this is, I should say, 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=173)   done with this huge confidentiality agreement thing. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=181)   Everybody knows that nothing is going to be revealed. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=189)   It's like, never to leave this room. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=192)   And then people are safe to reveal who they really are 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=199)   within that group, 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=201)   assuming they feel they're safe enough to do that. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=204)   And people start doing that. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=208)   And so it's everything. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=209)   It's how you think of yourself ethnically. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=217)   It's how you think about yourself sexually. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=221)   It's... you name it. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=226)   Have you ever been arrested? 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=229)   I was one of the few that crossed the line. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=233)   There weren't many of the Buddhist teachers 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=237)   that had actually been arrested. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=240)   I thought that was sort of cool. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=243)   Let's see. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=253)   Well, you know, are you of Jewish origin? 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=259)   Well, I'm sarcastic. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=260)   And me, Jack, and Joseph all ended up, of course, 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=270)   we just crossed at the same place, 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=273)   so we all said, ah, I'll just conquer Jewish teachers at this point. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=278)   So anyway. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=281)   But it was also things like, 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=290)   who believes in reincarnation? 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=293)   Well, not everyone crossed the line. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=297)   Who considers themselves a Buddhist? 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=303)   Well, the great majority crossed the line. 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=308)   But I didn't. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=311)   And I looked around and I saw a couple of other people. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=316)   You can probably guess who they were, okay? 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=320)   I'm not like, no way am I going to reveal their names. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=324)   But if you know anything about who writes books about what, 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=328)   you won't have too much difficulty figuring out 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=331)   who was left back there with me. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=333)   Because I couldn't really say that I'm religiously a Buddhist 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=344)   or identify myself that way. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=348)   Then how would I identify myself? 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=353)   Well, actually, we went through it yesterday. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=358)   I'm a generalized mystic. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=361)   With a scientific mentality. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=367)   However, absolutely, and hands down, 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=376)   the biggest influence on me is from the Buddhist tradition. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=381)   There's no doubt about that. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=383)   Why? Because I look upon the historical Buddha 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=386)   as the first and greatest mystic 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=392)   to attempt to have something like a scientific mentality. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=396)   To sort of say that, hey, mysticism doesn't have to be covered in mist. 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=402)   That it can be logic and evidence-based. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=406)   I mean, he obviously wouldn't use those words. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=410)   I don't make puns in English, okay? 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=412)   But you get the general idea. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=416)   He was scientist-like. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=420)   And it was not an add-on, it was core to what he did. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=427)   So to me, that's the model. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=430)   However, a Buddhist is someone that follows the Buddhist religion, 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=439)   which has all sorts of credos and all sorts of customs. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=445)   And I wouldn't really put myself in that category. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=454)   I can think of at least three things that are pretty prevalent in Buddhism 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=464)   that to me do not seem to be evidence-based. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=470)   And I've talked about that on occasion and so forth, 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=477)   so don't need to belabor that. 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=479)   But I would say, you know, I am certainly profoundly influenced. 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=486)   More than any human on this planet, I'm influenced by the historical Buddha. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=492)   And I just think that it's the job of us to build on what he discovered. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=506)   So, anyway, that's... 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=512)   But I wouldn't say I'm a non-Buddhist, okay? 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=517)   I would just not say I'm a Buddhist. 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=519)   I would say that... 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=524)   Well, there was once a Sufi master who said, 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=531)   I'm in agreement with 100 conflicting theologists. 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=539)   I agree with every one of these 100 conflicting schools of Islamic interpretation. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=546)   So, I think that's how I would characterize myself. 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=554)   I am comfortable in anybody's church. 
<br>[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=559)   I mean, really. 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=562)   Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=567)   It doesn't make any difference. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=569)   It all seems the same to me. 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=570)   I don't see the surface, I see the depths. 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McOX7m05qTQ&t=575)   So, anyway, there's that. 
<br>
