<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=0)   Can you explain to me what is the self? 
<br>[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=8)   So you have thoughts, correct? 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=11)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=12)   And have you noticed that those thoughts tend to occur constantly? 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=16)   Always. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=17)   Right? 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=18)   A lot of thoughts. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=19)   You also have body sensations. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=23)   Now have you ever noticed that some of those thoughts are visual, like you have memory, 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=31)   plan, fantasy, scenes? 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=33)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=34)   But some of them are auditory also, right? 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=36)   You hear dialogues, monologues. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=40)   And your body, some of the sensations are purely physical. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=45)   But when you have strong emotions, pleasant or unpleasant, you also experience them as 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=51)   changes in your body sensation, right? 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=54)   So you have mental experience that consists of visual and auditory thoughts, and it's 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=62)   continuous. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=64)   And you have body sensations, some of which are physical, some of which are emotional. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=71)   And they're pretty continuous too, right? 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=73)   So you're constantly pulled to mental states and body states. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=79)   And nothing mysterious so far. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=81)   No, no. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=82)   Anyone can see that. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=84)   You've probably also noticed that when a thought arises, you tend to say, this is me. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=91)   This thought is me. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=93)   Right, right. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=95)   And how about your body experience? 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=97)   We even said your, right? 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=99)   These sensations, they're me, right? 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=102)   Especially if they're emotional. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=105)   A broken leg is me, but a broken heart is, in some ways, even more me, an emotional sensation. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=114)   So you've noticed how moment by moment, there's a lot of thoughts, but we can analyze them 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=120)   sensorially into something visual and something auditory. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=125)   And you've noticed how moment by moment, you have physical sensations for sure, and sometimes 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=130)   emotional. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=131)   It's incessant. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=132)   And you've also noticed that as soon as a body state or a mind state arises, you tend 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=138)   to say, this is me. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=140)   These are my thoughts. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=141)   This is my body. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=143)   So to sum it up, you're going to get different answers depending on who you ask. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=149)   And those answers are all legitimate. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=152)   They're different perspectives on the word self. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=157)   But for me, the simplest way to think about self is, self is a moment by moment experience. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=166)   And that experience consists of mind and body. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=172)   And mind is mental image and mental talk. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=176)   Body is physicality and emotionality. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=179)   So your mental images, your mental talk, your physical and emotional experience is what 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=186)   you identify with moment by moment. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnpvqTvvWVU&t=190)   And that is the ordinary experience of self.
