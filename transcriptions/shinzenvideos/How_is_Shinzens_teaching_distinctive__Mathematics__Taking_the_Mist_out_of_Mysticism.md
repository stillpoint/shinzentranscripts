<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=0)   I'd like to define mindfulness as a three-fold attentional skill set consisting of concentration 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=12)   power, sensory clarity, and equanimity. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=16)   So to the extent that I am a quote meditation teacher, I teach concentration power because 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=23)   that's universal to any form of meditation. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=27)   To the extent that I am a mindfulness teacher, I also emphasize the sensory clarity and the 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=33)   equanimity. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=35)   Then there is the extent to which I sort of have my own distinctive way of going about 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=41)   mindfulness and that definitely has certain distinctive characteristics. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=54)   A lot of it goes to my background. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=56)   I have a pretty solid amateur knowledge of science and mathematics and that has informed 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=69)   the way that I teach mindfulness in a very, very deep way. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=75)   One of the things that you learn if you get into the physical sciences or mathematics 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=83)   at any kind of depth is you learn habits of precision in expression and thinking. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=92)   Habits of precision. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=93)   Of precision. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=94)   That's correct. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=95)   In other words, in ordinary colloquial English, force, impulse, energy, potential, momentum, 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=113)   action, and so forth, they all sort of sound like the same thing and we might use them 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=119)   interchangeably on occasion. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=122)   But in physics, each one of those words that I mentioned means something completely different 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=128)   and distinct. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=129)   Each one is defined very, very carefully and in many cases it took centuries for that precision 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=140)   of language to be honed and perfected. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=144)   For example, in the area of mathematics, if you take a beginning calculus class, you learn 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=152)   the definition of something called the derivative of a function. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=159)   I remember that. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=160)   You took that? 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=161)   I did. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=162)   I don't remember. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=163)   I remember those words. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=164)   I don't remember what they were. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=165)   You may remember some. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=166)   You may remember. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=167)   I remember a volume of a function but I can't remember what it was. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=170)   Well, you may remember an expression along the lines of, for any epsilon, however small, 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=178)   there is a delta such that if delta is the absolute value of etc., etc., etc. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=183)   Sure. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=184)   Well, anyway, that's the definition. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=186)   That's part of the definition of the limit of a ratio that's used to define a derivative. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=194)   In any event, it's defined with this, it's like incredibly subtle and incredibly complicated 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=202)   and you have to read it over and over and over and over again until it finally sort 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=207)   of registers and then after you've read it about a hundred times, it's like, oh, of course, 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=215)   it's so natural, it's so obvious. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=218)   Now, what they don't tell you in your beginning calculus book and what would have helped me 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=224)   a lot if they had told me was that that definition of the derivative was not the one that Newton, 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=233)   who invented calculus, used. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=236)   That was the result of generation upon generation, a good 17, 18, 19, yeah, like a good 250 years 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=250)   after Newton of the finest mathematical minds, Euler, Gauss, Cauchy, Weierstrass. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=257)   I know most people have never heard of these people but they're among the mathematical 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=265)   geniuses of the Western world. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=267)   Each one of them contributed something to that definition that the others hadn't seen. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=273)   That is the distillation of 300 years of contention, discussion, and thinking things over, the 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=288)   end result of which is this incredibly precise, incredibly powerful concept. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=296)   Well, you get used to dealing with that level of precision and you get used to the notion 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=302)   that you're going to have to really think about the definitions and read and reread 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=306)   and reread because it's worth it because an ordinary high school student who is willing 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=319)   to come back over and over and over again will be able to understand this as well as 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=325)   those, better than those mathematical geniuses because their stored wisdom is there. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=331)   I like to think of myself as on a mission to take the mist out of mysticism. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=341)   I think it can be done. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=342)   Mist out of mysticism. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=343)   Yup. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=344)   It can, using mysticism not in the sense of new age airy-fairy but in the sense of classical 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=350)   mystical experience as exists inside the great traditions of the world, essentially contemplative 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=358)   experience. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=359)   I'm academically, I said that I have a good amateur's knowledge of science and math but 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=369)   I have a professional academic trained knowledge of comparative mysticism and Asian languages 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=375)   and Buddhist studies and so forth. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=377)   That was my degree in graduate school, my degree program. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=383)   I sort of bring a very strong scholarship background because of knowing most of the 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=390)   Asian languages in which the technologies of internal exploration of the east are encoded. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=397)   Then I have this scientific thing which causes me to be extremely precise about how I define 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=405)   terms. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=406)   People that work with me have to be willing to put up with that but it saves them a lot 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=410)   of time in the end. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=411)   How so? 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=412)   Because they're able to eventually communicate and conceptualize the entire path to classical 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=419)   enlightenment precisely in words. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=424)   That's taking the mist out of mysticism. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=426)   So you ask me what's distinctive, I bring a scholastic background. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=431)   I bring a science background. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=436)   That informs the whole way that I teach. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=444)   Because I have this sort of broad view of world meditative practice, I've created a 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=452)   system that is a framework within which all of the major innovations in historical innovations 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=472)   in the contemplative technologies from the past, all of those major innovations can be 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=482)   formulated within the framework that I've created. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=485)   I call it five ways to know yourself as a spiritual being. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=489)   Each one of those five ways represents a distinct innovation that happened in history but I've 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=496)   reformulated it into modern secular language and placed it all on a universal framework 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QhO2GcCvQ&t=506)   within the mindfulness tradition. 
<br>
