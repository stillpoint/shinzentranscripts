<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=0)   Are you fixated in confusion? 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=9)   There's nothing wrong with being confused. In fact, being confused is really good. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=14)   Coagulating when you're confused, not good. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=19)   The goal is not to avoid confusion, doubt, disorientation. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=27)   The goal is not to avoid don't know. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=31)   The goal is to avoid the habitual coagulation around don't know. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=40)   Uncoagulated don't know is called spontaneity when it comes out of your body 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=50)   and wisdom when it turns in your mind. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=56)   I repeat, uncoagulated don't know is dynamic spontaneity when it comes out of your body 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EclHRdPJ8TM&t=64)   and wisdom when it turns in your mind.
