<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=0)   I guess for me the trick would be like, most of the time, the problem is lack of sensory 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=10)   clarity, so most of the time the practice is separating. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=14)   But there are those huge windows that open. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=18)   Where the practice is unified. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=19)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=20)   And that's the dialectic of this practice. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=24)   It's about, that's one of the balance aspects. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=29)   It's a dynamic balance. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=33)   There's a place, there's a whole list of empowering distinctions. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=40)   There's a whole list of empowering unifications. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=44)   And there's a whole list of disempowering distinctions. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=48)   And there are even disempowering unifications. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=50)   Yeah, that's exactly, I get that, I totally get that. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=54)   If you totally get that, you got a lot. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=57)   You got, your money's worth. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=59)   That's the beauty of it. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=60)   Yeah, what's an example of a disempowering, what are some examples of disempowering unifications? 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=66)   Enmeshment. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=67)   Say what? 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=68)   Enmeshment. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=69)   Enmeshment. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=70)   I mean, isn't that how we wrote off the book? 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=71)   Coda, enmeshment, weak ego structure, what are they, borderline issues. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=84)   And last but not least, identification with the aggressor, Patti Hurst syndrome. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=92)   Codependency. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=94)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=95)   So, there's this whole list of disempowering unifications, but there's also the flip side 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=103)   of all of the above is empowering unification. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=108)   And then there's disempowering distinctions, of which the main one is. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=114)   My identity stops with my skin. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=119)   That's the biggest disempowering distinction. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=125)   Distinction between inside and outside. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=127)   And then the distinction between material and spiritual, between form and emptiness. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=135)   Those are all disempowering distinctions. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=138)   So the name of the game is, or the bad news is, that most human beings are involved in 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=148)   disempowering distinctions and disempowering unifications. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=153)   The good news is that any human being who chooses to can flip it and with a lot of study 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=160)   and practice come to understand empowering distinctions and empowering unifications. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=169)   So the focus in technique is interesting, for example. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=174)   I usually present it to you as a deconstructive technique, but it's actually also a restorative 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=182)   technique. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=184)   People that have these, sometimes it's called borderline or boundary problem in the sense 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=196)   that they can't remember who they are when they're in the presence of the looming other. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=203)   Okay, there's this diagnosis, right? 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=208)   And I've had people that had like official psychiatric diagnosis of that weak ego structure 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=218)   thing and the description that they gave and the description from the Diagnostic and Statistical 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=224)   Manual was, you know, in the presence of other people, the looming other, they just can't 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=232)   keep contact with who they are. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=235)   Well guess what? 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=237)   The focus in technique will allow you to do that. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=240)   And that's what I used. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=242)   Actually this woman had had a lifelong, big time diagnosis, you know, from a professional 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=250)   psychiatrist. 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=251)   And what I did is I just had her, I put just a little different spin on the focus in. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=258)   Instead of using it to untangle the I am-ness, I had her use it to keep in contact with the 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=266)   fact that she does have an internal life even in the presence of the looming other. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=273)   And it's very tangible. 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=275)   And the clarity allowed her to know she had mental image, mental talk, and emotional body 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=280)   sensations even when the looming other was present. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=283)   And the looming other was any other human when it started. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=287)   And so that's the sensory clarity. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=289)   What's the concentration piece is to not lose contact with that content in the presence 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=296)   of the looming other. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=297)   It's just training. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=299)   Just training. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=301)   So that's now using the focus in, which in some ways could be thought of as breaking 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=308)   down the small self. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=310)   But just put a little different spin on it, it's actually empowering the ability to not 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=316)   lose yourself when you need to have a distinction between inside and outside. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=322)   So you've probably heard this expression, you have to have an ego before you can let 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=328)   go of the ego, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=330)   Well, I'm not sure that I would exactly formulate it that way, but I would say that there is 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=336)   a dialectical process. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=339)   And I drew a picture of it. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=348)   So anyway, you know who first came up with that expression about you have to have an 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=356)   ego before you can let go of it? 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=359)   That was Jack Engler, who is both a mindfulness teacher and at one time was the head of psychiatry 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=368)   at Harvard Medical School, which tells us something about the age in which we're living. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=376)   So I told Jack this story about the woman with the whatever, and he actually immediately 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=384)   invited me to do grand rounds at Harvard Medical School based on that whole paradigm. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDUBoOGnTqI&t=391)   I ended up, wasn't able to go, but it's just historically interesting.
