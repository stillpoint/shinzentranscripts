<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=0)   Another thing that's happening is I'm on to the single most exciting science research 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=14)   prospect of my career. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=16)   If my idea is right, well, you'll see it. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=23)   You will definitely see it. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=27)   So you want to hear the expansion and contraction on my idea? 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=31)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=32)   Okay, let's start with expansion. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=34)   No. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=35)   Which shall we start with? 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=38)   Let's start with expansion. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=42)   So you know, it's a big thing for me, what I call the philosophy of the American philosopher 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=61)   Harry, I don't know if you've ever followed Harry. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=74)   Dirty Harry pretty much summed it up for me. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=78)   He used sexist language, but that was just his character. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=83)   You have to forgive him for that. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=87)   One very important philosophical point that comes across from Dirty Harry is a man's got 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=96)   to know his limitations. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=100)   So what does that have to do with anything? 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=105)   Well there is a general tendency for people that have deep and authentic mystical experience 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=114)   to make broader claims about that than are justified, I think. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=123)   Don't get me wrong, it's still the best thing ever, ever, ever for our species. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=128)   But typically people that have these kinds of experiences claim that they have a special 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=138)   knowledge of the ultimate nature of nature and they have the final answer for everything. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=145)   I think that that's an irresponsible claim. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=151)   Irresponsible claims may seem innocuous enough, but they can poison our relationship to the 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=158)   scientific world. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=163)   Because in science the one thing you are not allowed to do is make irresponsible claims. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=169)   You have to have evidence and you have to have logic and it has to be tested and tested 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=178)   in many locations around the world for decades and decades before it's allowed to be called 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=186)   a theory. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=189)   So it's a big deal. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=192)   Because I am very colored by the philosophy of Dirty Harry, which is the philosophy of 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=199)   science, I don't like to make irresponsible claims. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=205)   Why am I going to say that? 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=207)   Because I'm about to say something that's going to sound like the most egomaniacal, 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=215)   hideous, delusional claim that you have ever heard me make. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=223)   But that's going to be the expansive side. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=225)   Then I'm going to show you the contraction that it's really not what you might think. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=230)   So I'm on to an idea that objectively, absolutely, incontrovertibly is worth billions of dollars. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=244)   I've got a billion, multi-billion dollar idea. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=252)   That is not an exaggerated claim. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=256)   I'll stand by it. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=259)   But now you have to hear the contractive side. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=264)   Whenever anybody says something, the first thing you ought to have to do is, what's your 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=269)   definition of X? 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=272)   You've talked about that over and over and over again. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=276)   By what criterion am I evaluating the monetary value of this idea, is the natural question 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=283)   to ask. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=285)   I'm evaluating it by the criterion of the way all science projects are evaluated, what 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=294)   statisticians call expected value or expectation value. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=304)   That is the value of success multiplied by the probability of success. 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=308)   Follow what I'm saying? 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=312)   That's the expected value. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=315)   It's basic statistics. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=319)   So what I gave you was not the value of the idea if it's successful. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=327)   I gave you the expected value. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=330)   The value of the idea if it's successful is vastly more than a billion dollars. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=338)   So what does that mean? 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=340)   Yes. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=341)   The probability of success is not really big. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=349)   I give it a thousand to one. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=352)   Now you might think, well, that's a real letdown. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=360)   They call it blue sky research or moonshot. 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=364)   It's actually an important aspect of science. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=370)   Some philosophers of science would say that blue sky research is the single most important 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=375)   kind of research to do in science. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=381)   Projects that have a reasonable probability of success with a huge payoff. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=388)   But one in a thousand is actually a reasonable probability. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=392)   Every idea I've ever come up with before has been one in a million, one in a billion. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=399)   Not very likely. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=403)   This is better. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=404)   It's one in a thousand. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=407)   But still it's one in a thousand, so do the math. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=412)   However the payoff would be trillions and trillions in monetary. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=416)   It would change the course of human history. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=421)   You could put a price on it, just figure out what the price of the world is, and then do 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=427)   some non-trivial percentage of that or some percentage of that. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=432)   So anyway, I got an idea and I've got scientists who think it's reasonable and I've got people 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=445)   that are willing to pay for the research. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=451)   That's really, really cool. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=454)   But it's also something I have to devote some time to. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=461)   So there's that. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=464)   I've already told you what the idea is actually. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=468)   It's actually on the YouTube. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=471)   The last person that interviewed me, I laid it all out if you're interested. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=475)   I think it was the last interview with the gas— 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=479)   Buddha at the Gas Pump, remember? 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=484)   It was that one. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=485)   I was talking about atheim hormia and the basal ganglia and neuromodulation. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=489)   That was the last time I heard this Buddha at the Gas Pump. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=494)   I'm pretty sure I talked about it at the end. 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=498)   One of the— 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=499)   It was your happy skull. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=500)   It was the culminated with. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=503)   So it involves my favorite disorder. 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=511)   I have a favorite disorder. 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=513)   It's a rare neurological disorder. 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=519)   It's horrible, don't get me wrong. 
<br>[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=521)   When it happens to people it's horrible, horrible, horrible. 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=526)   But it may have a huge silver lining for research. 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=532)   And even for those people, actually, if my hypothesis is correct, you can look it up 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=538)   on Wikipedia. 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=539)   It's called atheim hormia, A-T-H-Y-M-H-O-R-M-I-A. 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=548)   You can read a popular article about it in Scientific American Mind 2005. 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=556)   The article has the rather intriguing title of The Drowning of Mr. M—or no, no, I'm 
<br>[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=565)   sorry, Drowning Mr. M. 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=566)   Would you spell it again? 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=570)   A-T-H-Y— 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=571)   Well, now once again, words and their actual meaning. 
<br>[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=576)   I'm going to tell you the Greek origins, but that's not what the condition means, 
<br>[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=582)   okay? 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=583)   It's just what people called it. 
<br>[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=585)   So what does thymos mean in Greek? 
<br>[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=589)   T-H-Y-M-O-S. 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=590)   I'll give you a hint. 
<br>[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=592)   Dysthymia, euphymia, alexithymia. 
<br>[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=596)   It's what I call feel. 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=600)   Or it's emotion. 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=602)   Okay. 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=603)   Thymos is emotion. 
<br>[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=606)   And what's hormamine mean? 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=607)   I'll give you a hint. 
<br>[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=608)   Hormone. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=609)   They stimulate you. 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=613)   So it means stimulation or motivation. 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=620)   A is an alpha privative, which means without. 
<br>[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=623)   So if you just look at the words, it seems to refer to a condition where there is no 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=630)   emotion or motivation. 
<br>[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=633)   A-thym-hor-mia. 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=634)   Ia is a condition. 
<br>[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=639)   Horma is motivation or, yeah, motivation. 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=648)   Thymos is emotion. 
<br>[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=650)   So A is without. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=653)   So the word seems to mean, but does not in its essence actually mean, a condition of 
<br>[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=662)   no emotion and no motivation. 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=665)   Okay? 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=666)   A-t-h-y-m-h-o-r-m-i-a. 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=673)   Also sometimes called athymhormic syndrome. 
<br>[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=676)   It's a syndrome, which actually makes it interesting because it can be caused by a 
<br>[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=683)   wide variety of lesions in different locations and of different origins. 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=693)   And they can even happen at different times in a person's life. 
<br>[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=698)   But if they happen in just the right place on both sides of just the right circuit in 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=707)   the basal ganglia, you develop a caricature, not of stream entry, not of once-returner, 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=719)   not of non-returner. 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=721)   You develop a caricature. 
<br>[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=724)   I hope you all hear what caricature means. 
<br>[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=727)   Not the real thing. 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=729)   A bizarre something like Arhatsha. 
<br>[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=735)   Full in-line, full liberation. 
<br>[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=737)   Complete breaking of the identification of the mind-body process. 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=742)   Total freedom from desire. 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=745)   And the ability to experience pain of any sort, apparently, without any suffering. 
<br>[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=751)   And the ability to maintain a total mental tranquility indefinitely as a pathological 
<br>[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=761)   state with a well-defined physical origin. 
<br>[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=771)   So of course, a neuropsych medical professional sees a horrific disorder. 
<br>[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=788)   I see a caricature of full liberation with a known physical cause, purely biophysical 
<br>[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=801)   cause. 
<br>[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=802)   And a biophysical cause that any first-year medical student would immediately see on an 
<br>[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=810)   x-ray. 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=811)   Okay? 
<br>[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=812)   So it's nothing esoteric in that regard, but the effect on the human being is bizarre. 
<br>[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=825)   The other name for this condition is much more revealing. 
<br>[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=831)   It's mostly been studied by a handful of doctors in France. 
<br>[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=840)   The French name is PAP, P-A-P. 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=844)   Perte d'auto-activation psychique. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=850)   Perte is loss. 
<br>[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=853)   De auto-activation. 
<br>[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=857)   Of inner auto-activation. 
<br>[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=861)   They cannot boot personhood from the inside. 
<br>[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=866)   Cannot. 
<br>[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=867)   Now an enlightened person can manifest it or demanifest it as the conditions warrant, 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=878)   and the it is inner activation. 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=883)   People with this disorder are stuck on no-self, unless you activate them from the outside, 
<br>[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=893)   in which case, in the most ideal perfect case of athymormia, where the lesions are like 
<br>[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=900)   Goldilocks, not too big, not too small. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=904)   If they're just the right size and just the right place. 
<br>[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=909)   In the classic case, when you activate that person from the outside by speaking to them, 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=918)   they are completely normal. 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=922)   But unless you keep activating them, within a minute or two they fall back to a sort of 
<br>[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=933)   bizarre noble silence. 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=941)   This to me is intriguing. 
<br>[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=945)   It is not subtle. 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=948)   Knowing Mr. M is about someone who first noticed this condition while he was swimming in his 
<br>[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=957)   backyard. 
<br>[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=958)   The way he noticed it is that he no longer felt any need to swim or move his body. 
<br>[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=970)   Now it's true, his head was in the water and therefore he was breathing water. 
<br>[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=977)   He knew that he could turn his head any time he wanted, but breathing water, breathing 
<br>[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=984)   air, not so different. 
<br>[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=987)   He's aware that he's sinking to the bottom of the pool and that he's dying, but being 
<br>[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=995)   alive, being dead, not so different. 
<br>[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1000)   His daughter comes out, sees what's going on, screams and reactivates his normal self-preservation. 
<br>[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1010)   He flails to the surface and doesn't die. 
<br>[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1013)   Hence the intriguing title of the essay in Scientific American, Drowning Mr. M. 
<br>[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1019)   It's in your book. 
<br>[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1022)   Maybe I mentioned it briefly. 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1023)   Well, I've been looking a lot deeper into it, a lot deeper. 
<br>[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1033)   It's not an easy subject to look into scientifically. 
<br>[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1040)   Functional neuroanatomy at that level is not well understood. 
<br>[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1046)   But in any event, it's a caricature, but it has some overlap. 
<br>[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1065)   It's nothing mysterious or abstract. 
<br>[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1070)   It's grossly physical. 
<br>[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1076)   To me, the fact that it's stunningly dramatic and that it has some overlap—I don't know 
<br>[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1085)   exactly what the relationship is. 
<br>[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1088)   I mean, it is a disorder, but it overlaps in not just one or two ways. 
<br>[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1094)   It overlaps in about a half dozen ways with what we're spending our lives trying to 
<br>[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1101)   achieve here. 
<br>[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1107)   So that combination of we know physically exactly what's happening and it has an overlap 
<br>[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1114)   and it can happen within a week or a few minutes, and it has an overlap, many intersections 
<br>[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1125)   with what takes a lifetime to achieve with practice is not the whole picture. 
<br>[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1132)   As soon as I talk about that, people, they think I'm stupid or something. 
<br>[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1138)   They think I'm equating this with what we want, or they think I think this is the whole 
<br>[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1143)   picture of what we want. 
<br>[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1144)   I'm not naive, but I am saying that some things really jump out in this as a possible research 
<br>[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1154)   avenue. 
<br>[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1158)   Not so much to have a physical intervention. 
<br>[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1167)   My paradigm is not so much, oh, we're going to figure out a way to accelerate meditation. 
<br>[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1174)   I'm much more grandiose than that. 
<br>[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1182)   My paradigm is we're going to simply make liberation part of standard medicine everywhere 
<br>[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1188)   in the world. 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1195)   How could that possibly be? 
<br>[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1200)   Well, what's wrong, what's the difference between athymhormia and being an R-hot? 
<br>[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1211)   I told you what the similarities are. 
<br>[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1214)   That R-hot can activate itself. 
<br>[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1217)   That's certainly one difference. 
<br>[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1219)   I didn't hear that. 
<br>[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1220)   An R-hot can activate itself if need be. 
<br>[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1225)   I can show you the similarities, I can show you the differences, and then I can make some 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1233)   conjecture about how we may be able to get the baby and throw away the bathwater, so 
<br>[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1243)   to speak. 
<br>[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1244)   If that metaphor makes sense. 
<br>[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1249)   The baby being the liberation, the jewel and the lotus. 
<br>[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1254)   What is different? 
<br>[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1255)   Well, clearly one thing that's different is, see, this is why the condition is so perplexing 
<br>[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1266)   to doctors, the few doctors that know about it or have researched it. 
<br>[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1270)   It's very rare, by the way, very rare, because like I say, the lesions have to be in exactly 
<br>[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1278)   the right spot and exactly the right size. 
<br>[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1281)   If they're not big enough or not in the right locations, then you won't get this dramatic 
<br>[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1289)   effect. 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1290)   If they're too big or in the wrong locations, you get a whole bunch of other effects that 
<br>[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1295)   basically leave that person totally disabled and you can't boot a self by talking to them. 
<br>[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1303)   They have what's called a kinetic mutism. 
<br>[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1309)   The thing about atheimhormia is, on the surface it looks like a kinetic mutism. 
<br>[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1314)   A kinetic mutism means you no longer move and you no longer talk, but you're not in 
<br>[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1321)   a coma, you're not paralyzed, you're not even somnolent, you're not depressed, but you just 
<br>[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1332)   no longer talk or move ever. 
<br>[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1334)   So you might as well be in a persistent fidget. 
<br>[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1339)   That's the extreme case of a kinetic mutism. 
<br>[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1342)   That's when you get the lesions, similar lesions, but they're too big and then they just wipe 
<br>[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1347)   you out. 
<br>[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1349)   This is expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1351)   It's just right so that it leaves the possibility that just by speaking they're back to normal 
<br>[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1359)   without cognitive or behavioral deficit for about a minute. 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1368)   So you have to keep activating them. 
<br>[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1370)   Of course, if someone were to simply create an app that talked to them all day, presumably 
<br>[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1378)   they'd be back to normal. 
<br>[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1381)   Let's see, who knows how to design those kinds of apps? 
<br>[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1385)   I think I do. 
<br>[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1394)   One difference is you can't manifest self unless you are dependent on another person 
<br>[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1402)   manifesting, drawing it out of you. 
<br>[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1405)   But in the most ideal case, they're actually just normal for a few minutes. 
<br>[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1415)   I actually have a student who was a neuropsych evaluator who had this condition in a patient. 
<br>[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1427)   He's one of my facilitators back east. 
<br>[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1432)   He teaches neuroscience now actually. 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1435)   But he wrote up a case study and he confirmed for me just on his anecdote that absolutely 
<br>[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1442)   that's what it was like. 
<br>[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1445)   The guy never complained. 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1447)   He'd been a math prof at one of the New York universities, the patient. 
<br>[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1454)   If you asked him to deliver a lecture on advanced math he could do it just fine if you kept 
<br>[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1461)   him going. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1463)   But if you went away he would just sit there and look at you and wouldn't eat and wouldn't 
<br>[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1468)   move all day, day after day. 
<br>[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1472)   Not subtle, okay? 
<br>[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1475)   The size of these lesions, rice grain, but bilateral. 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1486)   For a few rice grains over the head of the caudate nucleus will do this if it's just 
<br>[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1492)   in the right place. 
<br>[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1495)   Whoa, that's pretty dramatic. 
<br>[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1497)   Okay, one difference, it's totally dysfunctional obviously so we don't want that. 
<br>[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1506)   So what makes up an integrated enlightenment? 
<br>[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1511)   Well concentration, clarity, equanimity, plus wisdom. 
<br>[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1516)   You have a paradigm about how, you know, about emptiness, suffering, self. 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1524)   You've got a view, a darshan, a dhāwa as the Tibetans say. 
<br>[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1529)   There's wisdom function. 
<br>[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1532)   And then there's the whole dimension of practice that might be called integration of the void, 
<br>[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1540)   the degree to which emptiness, your own emptiness, the emptiness of the world is a healthy, empowering, 
<br>[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1550)   enlivening, fulfilling, and liberating for you versus the degree to which it's not that 
<br>[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1559)   yet. 
<br>[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1561)   Some people have no difficulty integrating the void. 
<br>[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1564)   Some people have to work at it. 
<br>[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1567)   Some people have to work a lot harder at it. 
<br>[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1570)   Every now and again you get the dark night where it's actually sort of catastrophic but 
<br>[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1581)   still fixable. 
<br>[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1583)   But that's very labor-intensive and may take a long, long time to fix that. 
<br>[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1588)   So you have this whole spectrum of a dimension that might be called the degree to which the 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1595)   emptiness or the nothingness of self and world has been integrated. 
<br>[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1601)   It's functional. 
<br>[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1605)   It does good things. 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1607)   So concentration power, sensory clarity, equanimity, insight, wisdom, and integration of the void 
<br>[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1621)   might be one way to talk about dimensions of the practice. 
<br>[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1629)   So here's my hypothesis. 
<br>[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1633)   People with this condition have been biophysically, have biophysically induced irreversible perfect 
<br>[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1647)   equanimity or something like that. 
<br>[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1652)   Well, that actually could be a good thing. 
<br>[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1657)   The one characteristic in all cases reported is they don't complain about anything. 
<br>[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1666)   Now are they actually happy? 
<br>[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1671)   Okay so doctors know how to do something that they call a mental status exam. 
<br>[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1676)   If you go on YouTube and learn how to do it, it's interesting. 
<br>[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1680)   I did just for the fun of it. 
<br>[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1686)   Because they're a professional and it took actually many, many decades to figure out 
<br>[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1692)   how to teach doctors how to do this, a quick mental status exam. 
<br>[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1696)   It's very systematic. 
<br>[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1697)   It's very clever. 
<br>[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1701)   Like I say, if you're interested, just mental status exam on YouTube and you can get a little 
<br>[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1706)   tutorial on how to do it. 
<br>[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1708)   Why do I mention it? 
<br>[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1709)   Well, I'm a professional and I know how to do something called spiritual status examination. 
<br>[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1716)   It's just as well thought out and it's just as systematic. 
<br>[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1720)   No one has ever done a spiritual status examination on an athymormia patient. 
<br>[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1728)   I'm going to see if I can pull some strings and make that happen. 
<br>[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1735)   Until then I can make a hypothesis. 
<br>[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1738)   My hypothesis is they have a physically induced profound equanimity and they probably do not 
<br>[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1753)   have the taste of concentration or sensory clarity, because that has to be cultivated. 
<br>[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1760)   And they probably do not have the insight and they probably have not integrated their 
<br>[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1768)   own nothingness. 
<br>[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1769)   So they're probably lacking those three elements, four elements, is my guess. 
<br>[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1776)   So the question is, and I'm not pretending I know the answer to this question, but if 
<br>[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1786)   the answer happened to be in the affirmative, that could be very, very good. 
<br>[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1792)   But I don't have a clue. 
<br>[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1795)   But I certainly know what the question is. 
<br>[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1798)   Since these are all dimensions of a single gestalt in healthy practice, will the fact 
<br>[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1808)   that one of those dimensions seems to be on max all the time, would that make it easier 
<br>[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1818)   for them to quickly attain the other dimensions with interactive guidance? 
<br>[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1825)   Because remember you can turn them on by interacting. 
<br>[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1830)   So if they were given a little bit of interactive coaching, could we re-engineer this from a 
<br>[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1839)   bizarre caricature to something like the real thing? 
<br>[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1847)   Is there a potential for neuroplasticity in this condition? 
<br>[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1852)   I have no idea. 
<br>[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1854)   But I think it's an important question. 
<br>[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1856)   These lesions are static? 
<br>[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1860)   They're permanent, yeah, if that's what you mean. 
<br>[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1866)   And they happen... 
<br>[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1867)   Well, they're permanent and they don't change size. 
<br>[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1870)   That's correct. 
<br>[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1871)   Well, it's sort of... 
<br>[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1874)   Let's see. 
<br>[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1876)   They may change size if they're dependent on tumors. 
<br>[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1881)   It can be caused by a lot of things. 
<br>[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1883)   That's what's so amazing. 
<br>[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1884)   It can be caused by ischemic stroke, what are called lacunar infarctions. 
<br>[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1891)   But it can be caused by tumors in those locations. 
<br>[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1894)   Those might change size. 
<br>[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1896)   It can also be caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. 
<br>[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1901)   Apparently the basal ganglia are very vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning. 
<br>[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1908)   There's even one case where it was caused by a wasp sting, an anaphylactic shock. 
<br>[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1915)   Happened for whatever reason to hit right in the right place in the basal ganglia. 
<br>[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1921)   So they can be caused by various things, but essentially, yeah. 
<br>[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1926)   So let's say we got lucky. 
<br>[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1931)   Let's say that there's a one in ten chance that there's some potential for training here 
<br>[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1944)   that's significant. 
<br>[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1947)   That's just a guess. 
<br>[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1948)   It might be one in a hundred. 
<br>[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1954)   So if that were the case, that would be interesting and good for patients, for the few hundred 
<br>[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1965)   people around the world that has this condition. 
<br>[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1968)   We put it into an app for them and it would be nice. 
<br>[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1974)   But then we have to, of course, ask bigger questions. 
<br>[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1977)   Of course, go big or go home. 
<br>[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1981)   So let's say we got lucky. 
<br>[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1984)   Let's say it turns out that because they're in perfect equanimity, they can acquire all 
<br>[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1988)   this other stuff in a few weeks. 
<br>[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1993)   Now they'd still need an app to keep them like human, okay? 
<br>[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=1999)   But the combination of that app, the app would deliver two things. 
<br>[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2003)   It would keep them activated and it would train them in what they lack. 
<br>[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2009)   The paradigm, the integration, the concentration, the clarity skills. 
<br>[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2015)   Let's say we get lucky and this works. 
<br>[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2017)   Well that's great for a few hundred people that have a rare disorder. 
<br>[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2027)   And I don't give that even a high probability. 
<br>[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2031)   That's low probability that this is so. 
<br>[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2035)   Let's say we got lucky and it turns out it is so. 
<br>[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2038)   What's the next question? 
<br>[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2040)   What about everyone else in the room? 
<br>[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2047)   Well now, we could, of course, through various means, high intensity focused ultrasound, 
<br>[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2057)   for example, we could lesion your brain and then give you the app. 
<br>[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2064)   That something tells you that this is not going to get FDA approved. 
<br>[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2075)   Yes, imagine the IRB. 
<br>[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2081)   We want to take a healthy person and cause a horrific dysfunction that will cause their 
<br>[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2089)   family to have to pay millions and millions of dollars to warehouse them for the rest 
<br>[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2093)   of their lives. 
<br>[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2094)   And we would like human subjects approval to do this. 
<br>[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2101)   Well, maybe in the Third Reich, but certainly not in the civilized world. 
<br>[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2111)   But let me throw out a very weird sounding word, a very weird sounding phrase that is 
<br>[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2119)   not science fiction, but it actually is science, is done, is known. 
<br>[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2126)   You can look it up if you want. 
<br>[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2128)   It's going to sound a little weird, a little oxymoronic. 
<br>[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2137)   The phrase is virtual lesion. 
<br>[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2141)   Now you say, what the hell is a virtual lesion? 
<br>[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2149)   A lesion means destruction, damage to tissue. 
<br>[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2157)   So what's a virtual lesion? 
<br>[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2161)   Specifically what's a virtual lesion in someone's brain? 
<br>[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2167)   There are forms of neuromodulation which will temporarily downregulate or even suspend the 
<br>[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2177)   activity of a certain region in the brain in a way that no harm is done and the normal 
<br>[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2186)   activity returns in a short period of time. 
<br>[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2191)   That's a virtual lesion. 
<br>[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2196)   They're not very controllable at this point in terms of precision, location, and so forth. 
<br>[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2202)   But it is done. 
<br>[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2204)   It's done for basic science research and you can get an IRB for that. 
<br>[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2209)   You can get an Institutional Review Board approval. 
<br>[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2212)   That means a human subject's approval is done all the time. 
<br>[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2216)   I volunteer. 
<br>[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2218)   Now I've already decided which cranium is going to be the first one to go under the 
<br>[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2227)   virtual scalpel. 
<br>[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2230)   Guess which one? 
<br>[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2232)   It's a long, long tradition in medicine of doctors researching on themselves. 
<br>[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2239)   Sometimes the results have been fatal. 
<br>[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2241)   I didn't want you to hear that. 
<br>[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2242)   Maybe it won't have any effect on you. 
<br>[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2243)   How will you know? 
<br>[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2244)   Well, actually, my thing is I probably know better because I can calibrate the dose and 
<br>[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2253)   the location. 
<br>[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2255)   Would you lose the ability to calibrate? 
<br>[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2259)   Not if they're talking me through because you could activate me. 
<br>[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2264)   Oh, you guys are all freaking out. 
<br>[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2266)   Remember, the universities where we're planning on doing this will not give approval. 
<br>[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2274)   Unless it is absolutely safe. 
<br>[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2278)   I can promise you there's no university in the civilized world that is going to let anyone 
<br>[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2285)   do anything on anyone where there's a potential for damage that is known. 
<br>[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2296)   No one will allow me to do this unless a very, very tight ass group of people have looked 
<br>[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2308)   at it and said, this is safe. 
<br>[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2311)   This is not like you can't just go off and do stuff. 
<br>[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2316)   You have to get institutional approval. 
<br>[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2319)   They have structures and they are very, very conservative as to what they let you do. 
<br>[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2326)   Don't worry, I'm not going to come back like Max Headroom or something. 
<br>[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2339)   The next question is, can we temporarily induce it with virtual lesions? 
<br>[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2347)   Probably not, unfortunately, because the virtual lesions are hard to control. 
<br>[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2355)   Remember, we're talking about surgical strikes here. 
<br>[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2358)   We're talking about cubic millimeter precision. 
<br>[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2363)   So probably not too bad, but hey, let's give it one in ten. 
<br>[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2369)   Let's be generous. 
<br>[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2371)   Well, if number one turned out, that's a one in ten shot. 
<br>[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2378)   And number two turned out, that's a one in ten shot. 
<br>[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2380)   So now we're talking about a one in a hundred shot. 
<br>[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2386)   But that would mean that we could take people, put them in this state and accelerate their 
<br>[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2395)   practice. 
<br>[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2397)   That would be good for the meditators of the world. 
<br>[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2400)   But like I say, my ambition is much, much bigger. 
<br>[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2408)   It's like everyone or it's todo o nada. 
<br>[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2413)   It's like you do the whole thing, we fix the planet or I'm going home. 
<br>[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2423)   The next thing you'd have to get very lucky is that the medical establishment realizes 
<br>[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2433)   that this is an alternate, a better way to do a whole bunch of things that they're currently 
<br>[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2440)   trying to do. 
<br>[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2442)   Like treat addiction or manage pain or induce general anesthesia or cure depression. 
<br>[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2458)   For people to be depressed, you have to have negative ideation. 
<br>[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2467)   There's no such thing as being depressed without intense, incessant negative rumination. 
<br>[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2482)   People in an athiomorphic state have no rumination at all. 
<br>[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2487)   They can't ruminate, even if they wanted to. 
<br>[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2491)   I've got to ask myself, if we had safe, virtual athiomorphia and you took a depressed person 
<br>[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2501)   and suspended their depression completely for an hour or a week and were guiding them 
<br>[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2518)   in mindfulness practice the whole time, when that intervention is over, would it have any 
<br>[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2525)   effect? 
<br>[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2526)   Who knows? 
<br>[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2527)   But it's not a ridiculous question. 
<br>[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2536)   Maybe you get lucky. 
<br>[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2537)   Maybe you've got a cure for depression. 
<br>[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2541)   I'll put a monetary value on that. 
<br>[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2549)   So we'd have to get lucky, number one, and we probably won't. 
<br>[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2554)   The first lucky is the condition is actually one of enhanced neuroplasticity for acquiring 
<br>[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2563)   the other factors you need to be liberated. 
<br>[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2568)   Probably not, but maybe. 
<br>[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2572)   Then we'd have to induce it safely, reliably, controllably, easily, non-invasively. 
<br>[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2579)   Is there a way to do that now? 
<br>[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2585)   Probably not, but maybe. 
<br>[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2588)   Then it would have to turn out that doing that turns out to solve a lot of standard 
<br>[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2593)   medical things. 
<br>[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2596)   We know for sure that people in an athiomormic condition report pain, even intense pain, 
<br>[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2605)   without suffering. 
<br>[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2609)   In other words, they feel it, but they don't experience it as a problem. 
<br>[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2614)   I mean, I've meditated for a long time, but I cannot breathe water as easily as I breathe 
<br>[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2620)   air. 
<br>[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2621)   And this guy did in a minute, just because he had a tumor in just the right place. 
<br>[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2633)   So is this another way to have analgesia, anesthesia? 
<br>[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2643)   I don't know, but it's not a ridiculous question. 
<br>[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2651)   So first we have to get lucky the condition is treatable. 
<br>[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2655)   When we have to get lucky, we can induce it simply, reliably, safely, non-invasively, 
<br>[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2668)   controllably. 
<br>[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2670)   These are all big things. 
<br>[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2672)   And neuromodulation at this point might be able to do that. 
<br>[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2685)   So that's get lucky number two. 
<br>[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2687)   Then get lucky number three, it turns out that when you do this, it's not just a nice 
<br>[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2692)   thing for people that want to meditate, it speeds up your practice. 
<br>[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2696)   It has one, but I'm guessing if it has one, it probably has a half dozen, significant 
<br>[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2708)   applications in standard medicine, both physical medicine and psychiatry, addiction recovery. 
<br>[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2717)   That's get lucky number three. 
<br>[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2723)   Now how do you compute the probability of the overall success if it's contingent on, 
<br>[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2734)   let's say, one in ten chance of A, one in ten chance of B, one in ten chance of C? 
<br>[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2743)   What's the total probability of success? 
<br>[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2745)   One in a thousand. 
<br>[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2747)   One in a thousand. 
<br>[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2748)   It's a tenth. 
<br>[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2749)   Are you sure about three being one in ten? 
<br>[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2750)   Are you sure about your third case being one in ten, or do you guess it's one in ten? 
<br>[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2760)   My guess is somewhere between one in ten and one in a hundred for each of these. 
<br>[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2768)   So what does that give us? 
<br>[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2769)   If it's one in a hundred, that gives us a total probability of one one hundredth times 
<br>[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2780)   one one hundredth times one one hundredth. 
<br>[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2782)   What's that? 
<br>[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2783)   That makes it one hundred. 
<br>[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2785)   If it's ten, it's one tenth times one tenth times ten. 
<br>[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2790)   It's one in a thousand. 
<br>[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2792)   So somewhere between a million to one shot and a thousand to one shot I think is reasonable. 
<br>[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2802)   But the payoff is still going to be in the tens of trillions. 
<br>[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2807)   So the expected value is just huge. 
<br>[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2810)   So that's pretty exciting. 
<br>[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2811)   Question? 
<br>[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2812)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2813)   Can you explain why number one is necessary? 
<br>[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2823)   Well if it's not trainable, then it's not a situation that can be used to accelerate 
<br>[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2836)   spiritual growth. 
<br>[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2840)   Number one means... 
<br>[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2843)   If those subjects have possibly a normal brain that has a temporary lesion, a virtual lesion, 
<br>[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2850)   I am going to... 
<br>[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2851)  ...exclude number two. 
<br>[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2853)   Yeah, I'm going to guess that because the only thing different about the person with 
<br>[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2861)   the permanent lesions and the temporary lesions is one is permanent. 
<br>[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2867)   There's no other difference in the most idealized case of atheanormia. 
<br>[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2874)   There's a lot of difference that we know of, but there's a few subjects with the condition. 
<br>[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2883)   It seems to me that it might still be reasonable, even if number one fails, to find a, hopefully 
<br>[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2888)   not Shenzhen first subject, to step up and have a virtual lesion. 
<br>[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2895)   I'm guessing since the physical and psychiatric exams on the most idealized atheanormic patient 
<br>[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2904)   show them as being completely normal, it's most likely that there's nothing else going 
<br>[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2909)   on there. 
<br>[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2910)   So that's a nice idea. 
<br>[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2911)   You didn't have your first sell to the institution that you were also a part of. 
<br>[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2912)   You didn't have number one success. 
<br>[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2913)   No, no, actually... 
<br>[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2914)   Oh, now you're on to something. 
<br>[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2915)   Okay. 
<br>[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2916)   Now you're on to what we're actually going to probably do. 
<br>[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2929)   I don't think I'm going to be able to get access to the atheanormia patients. 
<br>[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2935)   That's a big deal because it's too rare and I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. 
<br>[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2942)   So I'm going to make a hypothesis that it's trainable and we're going to go right to the 
<br>[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2948)   virtual lesion. 
<br>[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2950)   So you're absolutely correct in that you're totally on the mark with respect to my strategies. 
<br>[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2964)   We want your brain. 
<br>[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2967)   So this isn't what I intended to talk about at all. 
<br>[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2972)   Here we are. 
<br>[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2973)   Did we get it on camera? 
<br>[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2975)   It's all on camera. 
<br>[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2976)   Okay. 
<br>[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2977)   We've got the record of it. 
<br>[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2978)   You heard it here first. 
<br>[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2981)   It's still between one in a thousand and one in a million. 
<br>[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2986)   But if we get very, very lucky, this is going in the archives, you could all say, I was 
<br>[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2995)   there when they made that YouTube. 
<br>[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=2999)   The one that has a thousand more views than any YouTube in the history of YouTube because... 
<br>[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3011)   So that's my thing. 
<br>[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3012)   Okay, go big or go home. 
<br>[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3015)   Have you ever got a dark night in a brain scene? 
<br>[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3022)   No. 
<br>[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3023)   I don't think someone else has. 
<br>[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3027)   But what we did capture at Harvard was a physical cessation in one of the participants, a real 
<br>[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3041)   neuroda where she was gone, gone, gone for a minute or two. 
<br>[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3049)   We captured that in an MRI scanner. 
<br>[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3053)   Even though it's been years ago, we still have not gotten around to analyzing that part 
<br>[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3057)   of the data. 
<br>[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3058)   It takes forever to analyze this data. 
<br>[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3062)   But we did capture that, but no, we've never gotten a dark night. 
<br>[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3064)   Well, I'm sorry. 
<br>[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3065)   I just got carried away. 
<br>[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3067)   I was just going to explain why I might not be answering your phone call. 
<br>[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3075)   Now I filled in the details so you can maybe have some vicarious whatever... 
<br>[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3084)   Say what? 
<br>[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3085)   You'll continue to retreat? 
<br>[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3086)   Oh yeah, yeah. 
<br>[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3089)   You won't see that much difference, just maybe a little latency in my response. 
<br>[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3094)   And now we're getting at equanimity. 
<br>[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3098)   Because he's off on his mad scientist trip doing what he always wanted to do, which is 
<br>[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3108)   control people's brains. 
<br>[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3111)   Okay, well, sorry about that. 
<br>[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3116)   I got carried away. 
<br>[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3118)   Is there anything we can do to help? 
<br>[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3123)   Volunteer your brain? 
<br>[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3124)   No, deepen your practice. 
<br>[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3129)   That's what helps. 
<br>[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3131)   It forms the base in the world to deepen your own practice. 
<br>[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3135)   Because the more people that go deep, it creates a culture where someday some team of researchers 
<br>[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3148)   will pull off something like this, if we can last long enough. 
<br>[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3153)   Now, can we last long enough? 
<br>[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3156)   That's a whole other thing. 
<br>[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3157)   I'm not going to predict if we're going to make it or not. 
<br>[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3161)   But if we can somehow just hang on, keep civilization going for another century or so, I would say 
<br>[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3170)   there's a high probability that some group of people will come up with something like 
<br>[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3178)   this. 
<br>[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3179)   And then the world will change rapidly, rapidly for the better. 
<br>[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3186)   It's the old messianic vision, but not based on mythology, based on logic and evidence. 
<br>[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZ6KiiBIg4&t=3195)   So anyway, so much for that.
