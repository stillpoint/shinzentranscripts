title: "How 'Focus on Positive' is a Mindfulness Practice ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=0)   What is the role of positive focus? 
<br>[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=6)   One thing I appreciate in this formulation of the five ways that you have honed 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=15)   is that in the years I've been studying with you, 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=20)   the role of what is now called focus on positive 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=25)   was not emphasized a lot in retreats. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=30)   And when you formulated the five ways, 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=32)   you made this place for what you call focus on positive 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=36)   that includes, we used to have some place for love and kindness, 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=40)   but this is this huge broad range of content that this covers. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=47)   And I wanted to know, since you've been incorporating that 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=51)   as one of the five ways that you're doing, 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=56)   I wondered if you've noticed a shift or any change in your students in the teaching 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=62)   and if that's been lubricating the experience in any kind of way or not. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=71)   It's definitely made an improvement. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=75)   The idea was, or I guess the central insight behind it, 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=82)   was to realize that all over the world, 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=86)   there is a vast range of practices that all have something in common. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=95)   What they have in common is they involve intentionally creating 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=103)   and holding positive content in your subjective world. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=108)   Now by the subjective world, I mean mental image, 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=112)   internal talk, and emotional type body sensation. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=117)   So there's a traditional practice that goes with mindfulness 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=122)   called loving kindness where you do that, 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=127)   but it's in a certain direction. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=129)   There's certain set words typically that one uses. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=133)   There are certain set emotions that may or may not accompany that in the body and so forth. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=141)   And typically people, well I don't say typically, 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=144)   but a lot of people don't like doing it. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=147)   It's just like, I don't want to turn love on like a faucet kind of thing 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=152)   or it doesn't work for them, it leaves them cold. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=155)   Or at that moment. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=156)   Or it brings up the opposite. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=158)   So it occurred to me that, well, that's a specific instance of a much broader, 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=165)   more general phenomenon. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=168)   If you were to do cognitive behavioral therapy, 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=172)   they would have you intentionally create certain kinds of talk that was more rational. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=178)   And you would try to hold that and pay attention to that 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=181)   even though irrational talk might be coming up. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=185)   Some people are into the laws of attraction, manifestation, the secret. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=192)   The power of positive thinking. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=194)   Now I don't comment on the validity or falseness of that belief system, 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=200)   but in fact that involves intentionally visualizing, working with image space and so forth. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=207)   For that matter, prayer, as it's traditionally done, 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=211)   certainly involves talk space and in the Catholic form, 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=216)   if you're doing the rosary, you've got talk, 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=218)   you're supposed to visualize certain scenes of the stations of the cross and so forth. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=224)   You've got the Pater Noster, the Ave Maria in talk space, which is a Christian mantra, 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=229)   and you're supposed to have certain joyful or sorrowful emotions in your body. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=233)   So they're working intentionally with feel-image-talk. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=237)   Andriana practice, same deal. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=242)   Athletes visualizing their perfect performance. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=246)   People visualizing desirable outcomes of success. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=250)   People wishing well for other people in a general way. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=256)   People visualizing their own improved behavioral changes in personal behavior. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=262)   There's this vast range of things that people do. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=266)   And they all have something in common. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=268)   They involve working with one, two, or all three of the subjective sensory elements, 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=275)   not in the sense of observe, but in the sense of actively create and hold. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=282)   So it occurred to me, why not just unify that, 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=285)   give people the choice to do it in whatever way they want, 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=290)   and that way they're not limited, 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=293)   if they want to do a sort of gushy loving kindness, that's fine. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=297)   If they want to do a sort of new age magical thinking, that's fine. 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=303)   If they want to do a cold rational cognitive reframing, that's fine too. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=311)   If they want to merge with an archetype, hey, that's fine too. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=315)   However you want to do it, just do it. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=318)   But understand that in doing that, you are actually doing a kind of mindfulness practice. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=327)   See, I put... 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=328)   It's brilliant to give that freedom now. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=330)   Yeah, well, so that's helped. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=332)   In answer to your question, it's people having that freedom to do that. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=336)   Now they can get into it, whatever it may be. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=339)   But from my perspective, my main interest in having people do this 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=344)   is as a form of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=346)   Now that's not traditional. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=348)   Usually the loving kindness and whatever is in contrast to mindfulness. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=353)   But I see it as under the category of mindfulness 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=358)   because of the way I choose to define mindfulness. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=361)   I define mindfulness as any practice that elevates concentration, power, 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=369)   sensory clarity, and equanimity. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=372)   And I would claim that holding certain positive content in feel-image-talk, 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=378)   do you have to have concentration to do it? 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=380)   Sure. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=381)   So it will build concentration. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=384)   You have to have equanimity with all the distractions of negative that will come up 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=389)   because when I teach it, it's not a fight between positive and negative. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=394)   It's a selective attention to positive and let the negative just run rampant if it wants. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=399)   You're not trying to reject the negative and identify with the positive. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=404)   You're just selectively focusing on the positive. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=407)   So you're having equanimity with the negative. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=409)   You're not pushing it down. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=411)   You're not locking onto it either. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=413)   So the equanimity piece is there. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=415)   And probably most important, you're developing sensory clarity 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=419)   because you're getting a familiarity with the three subjective spaces, 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=424)   not by observing them but by actively creating with them. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=429)   So it's a kind of active learning to become intimate with your subjective experience. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=435)   So from that perspective, it falls perfectly within the category of mindfulness practice. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=442)   So it gives people an enormous freedom to do what's interesting and fun for them 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=447)   while at the same time developing the core skills 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=450)   that are the defining feature of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=454)   So it's worked out very well. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAIF9V7Qee4&t=456)   Thank you for your time today. 
<br>
