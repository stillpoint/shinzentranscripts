<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=0)   Okay, well, sometimes people ask, okay, when I do intellectual work, I can't meditate, 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=11)   because I've got to do the intellectual work. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=15)   Or is there a way I can meditate, etc.? 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=18)   I'll just share my experience. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=21)   I think different people will have different experiences, but my experience is that when 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=26)   I do intellectual work, when I do writing, or I'm trying to figure stuff out, I can't 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=32)   implement any kind of formal technique. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=39)   But what I can do is I can pepper that experience with little moments of practice in life. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=49)   So what that involves is what I call stop on a dime, okay? 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=54)   It's like, okay, I'm doing this, I'm doing this, I've been doing this for an hour, and 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=59)   I really like to keep doing this, but... 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=84)   Stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=100)   Now what's going to happen? 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=102)   Well, maybe everything will be peaceful and formless after 50 years of practice. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=111)   Just kidding. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=113)   But probably there will be a Vesuvius called the eruption of past and future. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=123)   And that will erupt in the seeing, hearing, feeling, probably. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=129)   So you implement a technique, even if it's only for 30 seconds. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=141)   You open up completely to that. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=146)   In those 30 seconds, if you bring the totality of your intentionality to do a quality period 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=156)   of practice with whatever erupts, then you can actually do retroactive meditation. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=167)   Now retroactive meditation is by definition oxymoronic, isn't it? 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=173)   Because it's meditation, mindfulness particularly, is always in the moment, right? 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=179)   How can you possibly retroactively be mindful? 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=183)   But you see, while you were bopping around doing this, doing that, doing this, doing 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=187)   that, all those energies were getting agitated, activated. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=192)   When you stop on a dime, you only have a couple minutes. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=198)   But if you really bring your triple A game during those couple minutes, everything that 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=207)   got stirred up in that hour or two hours of just ordinary unconscious frenetic activity, 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=214)   it's right there in those couple minutes. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=217)   And if you can have a complete experience of that, it effectively has the same effect 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=226)   on your overall growth pattern as having meditated for those two hours. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=233)   You do it retroactively, but you have to really bring your A game to whatever got stimulated. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=238)   So when I do things that I just have to do things, where I can't keep a technique going 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=246)   during the thing because I'm just doing the thing, then I pepper it with this stop on 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=252)   a dime, start on a dime. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=255)   So stop on a dime is you stop the activity, no matter how much you want to keep doing 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=260)   it, okay? 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=261)   The mindfulness bell rang, I remember, okay, got to pepper the day, stop on a dime, and 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=266)   then you start on a dime. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=268)   Feel in, gone. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=270)   See out. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=271)   See out. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=272)   Feel in, gone. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=273)   See out. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=274)   Feel in, gone. 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=275)   See rest. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=277)   See rest. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=279)   See in, gone. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=282)   No hesitation. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=284)   Not, oh, I got to sit here for 15 minutes and focus on my breath and then I can note 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=291)   what's going on. 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=292)   No. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=293)   See out, gone. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=294)   See out, gone. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=295)   Feel in, gone. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=297)   Okay? 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=298)   Just start on a dime. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=300)   No hesitation. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=302)   Because as, who was that that said that? 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=311)   Can't remember right now. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=321)   It'll come, Victor Frankel. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=324)   Victor Frankel said, between the stimulus and the response, there is a gap. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=334)   Therein lies your freedom. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=337)   In daily life, stuff comes up and about three seconds later, a reaction occurs from you. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=352)   The degree to which there is mindfulness in that three seconds or two seconds, therein 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=361)   is measured your freedom. 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=364)   So we want to be able to implement these techniques instantly. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=372)   Because in daily life, two or three seconds, if you're not Johnny on the spot with mindfulness, 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=382)   the terrorists are in the cockpit. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=386)   You follow my metaphor? 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=389)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=390)   The lizard brain is going to run the show. 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=395)   And then you look back and it's like, why did I do that? 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=398)   When I could have done this other thing. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=401)   So if you have to do actions where you just have to do the action and you can't keep a 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=408)   technique going, that's okay. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=411)   But then pepper it. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=413)   Stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=415)   Stop the action. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=417)   Occasionally start on a dime. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=420)   Just bring your AAA game, even if it's only for two minutes, to whatever got stirred up. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=427)   I don't know what your experience will be, but my experience is that the forces of past 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=437)   and future are what I have to face when I stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=443)   It's like there's this tidal force that says, look back at what just happened. 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=452)   Look forward as to what needs to happen next. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=456)   So there's this powerful pull of past and future. 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=462)   Time before and time after. 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=466)   T.S. Eliot has a whole poem about this. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=471)   Maybe I'll read it next time. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=474)   Lamenting how everyone lives in time before and time after. 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=480)   Almost everyone. 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fG-MXm7zWI&t=482)   Very few people live in the present. 
<br>
