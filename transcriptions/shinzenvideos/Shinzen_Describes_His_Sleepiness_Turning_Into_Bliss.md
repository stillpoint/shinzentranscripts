<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=0)   Actually, I got really sleepy during the afternoon sit today. And, you know, I mean, I've been 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=19)   doing this for decades and decades and I learned something new every single time. It's amazing. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=31)   So what I did is I got really physical with it. It was just like the physical sensations 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=38)   of sleepiness. And I did the thing that I described in the group process this morning 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=44)   about zoom in and zoom out. So the primary was there was one primary here and one primary 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=52)   here. I get this sort of yucky sensation here and then I get this painful, yawny hypoxia 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=59)   sensation here. So I like zoomed in to the center and then I was able to have this expansive 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=67)   concentration where I could really feel the whole body at once. I mean, like really in 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=73)   a lot of detail, but just that one flavor, the sleepiness flavor. So like zoom in and 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=81)   then cover the whole thing and do the same thing here. And man, about halfway through 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=85)   the set, it just, it just turned into this like slow lava lamp thing. And it just got 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=95)   like really integrated and really blissful. It's like, anyway, so, you know, you got to 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=105)   make a start somewhere and you learn and then you learn more and you learn more and you 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQP9wwsoiMg&t=113)   grow with it.
