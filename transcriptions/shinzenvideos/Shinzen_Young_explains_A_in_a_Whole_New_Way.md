title: "Shinzen Young explains 'A' in a Whole New Way"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=0)   So, I wanted you to see my favorite t-shirt. 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=11)   I don't know if you can really see it all that good. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=16)   I have a whole blog about this. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=19)   It's hard to miss, really. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=27)   Essentially, it's this concept. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=33)   A, big A inside a circle. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=37)   So, you know where I got this t-shirt? 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=41)   So, this is crew swag from the Avengers movie. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=49)   This gave me a lot of geek cred at the Buddhist Geeks a couple years ago. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=59)   You may remember their first meeting. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=63)   I was the keynote speaker. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=65)   I wore this during the conference because the movie hadn't come out yet. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=74)   So, that's what gave me the geek cred. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=77)   I had stuff from the movie before it was available to the public. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=85)   So, I was over at their place and he had all this crew swag. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=89)   He said, you can take whatever you want. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=92)   And this immediately jumped out. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=95)   So, you may or may not have an idea of why. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=101)   But take a look. It's A, first letter of the alphabet, inside a circle. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=109)   So, does that set off any possible associations, Buddhist-wise? 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=116)   Good guess. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=123)   Not completely unrelated. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=127)   Well, the circle, called ens≈ç, you can look it up on Wikipedia. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=134)   The circle is used a lot in Zen for the obvious symbolism of fullness that is also empty. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=148)   For example, in Soto Zen, and actually some Renzai also, 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=154)   when you sit, you sit with this mudra, this circular mudra. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=159)   This is called the Dharmadhatu Samadhi Mudra. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=163)   I love the name. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=165)   Dharmadhatu means the realm of the dharma, the realm of the absolute. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=171)   Samadhi is samadhi, in this case concentration, and mudra is a hand gesture. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=177)   So, this is sort of like the cosmic samadhi hand gesture. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=181)   So, I saw the circle immediately and its associations and its meanings. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=189)   But what really jumped out was the letter A in the middle of it. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=195)   It reminded me of something from the school of my original ordination, 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=203)   which is Japanese Shingon. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=206)   Shingon is Japanese Vajrayana practice. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=209)   And as you no doubt know, visualizations are a fairly central part, 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=216)   both in the Tibetan versions of Vajrayana and in the Japanese version. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=222)   And there is a practice that is done not only by the monks, 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=231)   but by householders, the average lay people in Japan 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=236)   that are associated with the Shingon school. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=240)   They're taught this very simple visualization called Ajikan. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=247)   So, kan means a visualization. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=250)   It's the same kan as in kanzeon, so it means contemplate. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=258)   Actually, kanzeon means see the world's sounds. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=264)   But by extension, contemplate and so forth. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=267)   So, that's this kan character. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=269)   Ji is the same as in kanji. It means a character. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=274)   So, what does A mean? 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=276)   Well, A is not just the first letter in the English alphabet. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=281)   One version or another of it is the first letter in the Greek alphabet, alpha. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=289)   It's also the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, aleph, 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=295)   which pretty much sounds like alpha, and that's no coincidence. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=299)   And it's also the first letter in all of the alphabets of India, 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=304)   specifically Devanagari, which is the Sanskrit alphabet used in North India. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=311)   A is the first letter. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=313)   So, this is not a coincidence. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=317)   The alphabet is one of the most extraordinary cases of cultural diffusion known to anthropology. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=326)   It was invented once. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=328)   There actually is just one alphabet. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=331)   It was invented once about 1000 BC in what's now Lebanon, essentially, 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=338)   which was the center of Phoenician culture. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=345)   And the Phoenicians were sort of the northern cousins of the Israelites, 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=352)   essentially the same language, Biblical Hebrew. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=357)   Phoenicians are very similar to that. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=360)   So, they invented this alphabet, alephbet, gimel, david, hevav, zion, in the Hebrew order. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=369)   And that diffused. The Greeks picked it up from the Phoenicians. 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=380)   The Etruscans picked it up from the Greeks. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=382)   The Romans picked it up from the Etruscans. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=385)   And we, English speakers, picked it up from the Romans. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=390)   So, it went west, but it also went east. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=394)   As the Aramaic script, which is what's used to write Hebrew now, 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=402)   that's actually Aramit, that's actually an Aramaic version of the alphabet, 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=408)   derived from the Phoenician. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=410)   And then it spread and became the Arabic alphabet, used all over the Islamic world. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=417)   It spread further east. Aramaic script was introduced into the eastern part of the empire 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=427)   of Alexander the Great during the Hellenistic period, 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=430)   and was modified and became Devanagari, the alphabet used for Sanskrit. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=437)   That spread down into South India. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=440)   And the cultures influenced by India through Buddhism, Tibet. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=445)   In fact, if you sort of squint your eyes and look at Tibetan, 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=450)   and you squint your eyes and look at Hebrew, it's sort of similar. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=455)   That's not a coincidence. That's totally amazing. That is not a coincidence. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=460)   The Tibetan script is derived from a form of Devanagari. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=467)   Devanagari is derived from essentially the same alphabet used to write Hebrew. 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=472)   Both go back to the Phoenician, but it gets more interesting. It spreads even further. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=478)   So, because mantras are important in Vajrayana practice, 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=487)   you visualize the letters, you chant the letters. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=490)   So, when the Japanese picked up Vajrayana, with it came a knowledge of how to write Sanskrit 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=504)   in an Indic alphabet. Now, they write with a brush, 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=510)   but they write the letters of a modified form of Devanagari called Siddham alphabet. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=518)   So, to this day, monks in my school learn how to write the mantras in the actual Indic script, 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=532)   not relying on kanji or Chinese characters or kana. 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=537)   So, that means that all the way from Japan in the east to England and Wales in the west, 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=553)   that single alphabet spread, diffused. 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=557)   So, the first letter of the alphabet is A or Aleph or A. 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=568)   And in the Sanskrit language, as in the Greek language, 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=575)   A or An, it's the same thing, is negation. 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=581)   It's the negation, right? Symmetry, symmetric, asymmetric. 
<br>[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=587)   Think of any Greek word and the opposite of it, the negation of it will have an A. 
<br>[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=598)   What are some other examples? 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=600)   Typical, atypical. Great. What are some other examples? 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=607)   Something else? We use that one? 
<br>[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=611)   Atheistic. Without Theos, without God. 
<br>[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=616)   So, the letter A is the great negator. 
<br>[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=624)   So, the contemplation of the letter A is used to, 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=638)   not at first to develop, of course, concentration power through visualization, 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=644)   but then to lead you to the insight of the great negation. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=653)   What is the great negation? 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=655)   Well, the unborn state. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=659)   And what is the unborn state? 
<br>[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=662)   Well, you've all meditated on it many, many times with my system. 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=666)   Gone. Okay? 
<br>[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=669)   So, A stands for gone. 
<br>[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=671)   As the source of all things. 
<br>[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=675)   The great, the rich nothingness, the nada, the nihil, 
<br>[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=683)   the nihil par excellence, the nothing par excellence. 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=688)   Whence our sensory experience arises and whither it returns, 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=693)   moment by moment, whether we notice that or not, 
<br>[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=696)   and as we notice it more and more, we're called more and more enlightened. 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=701)   So, it immediately jumped out to me that, wow, this is a really cool t-shirt. 
<br>[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=706)   Because it's got both the ensoul, which is sort of like the Zen symbol for the rich nothingness, 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=718)   and it's got the ah, the alpha privative, it's called. 
<br>[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=723)   The A that negates, symbolizing the primordial state of the unbornness. 
<br>[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=732)   Aji honkusho, they say in Japanese. 
<br>[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=735)   The character ah points to the original face. 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=742)   They don't use that phrase, but the un, before your parents were born, you know, the Zen expression. 
<br>[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=748)   Before your parents were born, before your parents were born, right? 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=756)   Before expansion and contraction separated, you had a face. 
<br>[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=761)   What was it? 
<br>[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=763)   Well, it would be the face of zero now, wouldn't it? 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=766)   The primordial unborn. 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=768)   So, I thought, there's a lot of Buddhist meaning in the Avengers movie. 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR6HblD75hw&t=777)   So, that was the piece of crew swag that I grabbed. 
<br>
