title: "Mindfulness Strategies when Interacting with Others ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=0)   Now, on retreats, we normally are keeping silence. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=16)   But I got a note about in daily life when we're talking to people, how can we formulate 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=29)   strategies for meditating or for doing a practice when talking to people? 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=37)   Well, sometimes when you're talking to someone, it's a substantive conversation. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=45)   So you really need like 100% of your CPU to be carrying on that. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=52)   So in those cases, you just have to accept the fact that you can't actually implement 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=58)   a, or you, no, I don't want to put it that way, you may not be able to implement an intentional 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=67)   strategy because you have to just be paying attention to what's going on. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=72)   However, there is a gradation in our conversations with people with regards to how substantive 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=83)   the conversations are. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=86)   A lot of conversations that we have with people are not, do not require our total CPU, if 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=94)   you follow my metaphor, to be engaged with that person. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=99)   So we get an interesting figure ground reversal here. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=105)   Normally good conversations are ones that are substantive. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=109)   And just listening to somebody blabber or shoot the breeze with vacuous social 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=126)   clich√©s or what have you, those are considered like not great conversations. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=132)   But here's where the figure ground reversal comes in. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=136)   Those now become the great conversations. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=139)   You understand why? 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=142)   Because you've got some wiggle room, you've got some extra energy that you can use to 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=152)   implement a formal strategy. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=157)   So you can just listen to people talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=166)   talk, okay? 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=167)   And it's great, the more they talk and the less you talk, the easier it is to continue 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=174)   implementing your technique. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=177)   So it gives you a completely different way of thinking about interactions. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=182)   So then you train yourself. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=185)   You are responding to them, you're not spacing out, but you're training a variety of possible 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=196)   focus strategies. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=197)   So what are some of the things that you could train under these circumstances? 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=203)   Well one thing is you can use part of the focus out thing. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=212)   You can anchor yourself in the sights and sounds of that person. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=218)   You're really listening and you're really looking. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=223)   That's one strategy. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=225)   Another strategy is meta in the body. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=231)   You sort of, you know, we look at people, we smile, it's sort of a social convention, 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=238)   but you can use Samadhi to inflate that social smile into a real like whole body experience 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=248)   of unconditional love just pouring out of your pores. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=256)   It can be trained and it's very, very powerful once you learn how to do this. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=262)   So one of my most common strategies for meditating in conversations is, okay, the sights and 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=273)   sounds of the person or the loving kindness kind of thing. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=279)   Other strategies are possible. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=281)   The important thing is you sort of pick your battles. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=286)   You say, okay, guess what? 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=288)   In this conversation, I got enough wiggle room that I can respond appropriately and 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=295)   be implementing this technique. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=300)   So people often worry though, well, if I'm implementing a formal technique while having 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=306)   a conversation with someone, number one, people have two worries. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=314)   First it's like, well, I'll get so involved in the technique that I won't be able to 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=319)   be appropriate. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=320)   That's the worry number one. 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=323)   Worry number two is I'm going to look weird or they're going to see that I'm like secretly 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=328)   doing this, whatever. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=331)   Okay, so let's address the first concern. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=337)   Like the proverbial, you know, pat your head and rub your belly. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=342)   Or is it, yeah, I guess it's that way. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=347)   That's really hard. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=350)   Okay, whatever. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=356)   So you might be a little awkward initially, but people usually don't notice. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=367)   And then you gain some facility to it. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=370)   You can keep the technique going and, you know, respond and you don't feel awkward at 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=376)   all. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=377)   So yeah, you might need to be willing to feel a little bit awkward initially because you're 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=383)   not using the ordinary strategy that we use when we're having conversations with people. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=390)   The ordinary strategy that we use when we have conversations with people is we're constantly 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=396)   going into our see-in, hear-in, feel-in system to plan what we're going to say next. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=405)   Constantly being pulled back into the subjective world. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=408)   Now you're starting to, I mean, of course that could be a technique. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=412)   You could be observing your see-in, hear-in, feel-in reactions to that person. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=417)   However, in that case, you're observing them. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=419)   You're not actually buying into them or using them to plan what you're going to say next. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=426)   So, that's where the little awkwardness may come in for a little while because it's like 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=433)   whatever strategy you're doing, even if it's observing your reactions, certainly if it's 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=438)   a focus out or a radiate love from your body thing, you're not constantly now going back 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=446)   to see-in, hear-in, feel-in to figure out what you're going to say next. 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=452)   And if you pay close attention, you'll see that's what we constantly do. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=457)   So you might feel a little bit awkward, yes, initially. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=465)   But then you learn that you actually don't need to constantly go to that place in order 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=471)   to be appropriate. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=476)   So that takes care of concern number one. 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=479)   Concern number two, well, they'll know that you're like doing a technique. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=483)   Well, guess what? 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=485)   Your technique is not to disengage from them. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=490)   You are anchoring in their sights and sounds or you are radiating in all directions, including 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=497)   their direction, unconditional positive regard. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=501)   So in fact, you're more engaged with them. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=504)   In fact, what disengages people is that constant pulling towards your own mind and emotions 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=512)   that's reactive or planning and so forth. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=515)   So if that doesn't happen, then actually people feel that you're like really giving them attention. 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=525)   You're giving them time and space and people find that very attractive. 
<br>[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=533)   The less something you have inside yourself as you're interacting with a person, that 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=545)   sort of emptiness is like a magnet. 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=551)   That person, unless they're an experienced practitioner, has a constant pressure of seeing, 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=557)   hearing, and feeling. 
<br>[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=559)   You're now learning how to communicate with that person without having within yourself 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=564)   that constant pressure of seeing, hearing, and feeling. 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=568)   That creates, in a good sense, a vacuum inside you. 
<br>[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=573)   So it's like an osmotic gradient or a pressure gradient. 
<br>[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=577)   The ego pressure that they have can dissipate in the space of your ego absence. 
<br>[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=585)   And that creates a force that attracts people towards you, a kind of magnetic force. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=593)   They don't know why, but they're pulled by that pressure gradient, if my metaphor makes 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=601)   any sense at all. 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=602)   So be willing to take a chance and start flapping your lips without planning what you're saying. 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=612)   And as you get better and better and better at that, you will eventually learn how to 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=617)   ride the ox backwards. 
<br>[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=619)   That's a Zen metaphor. 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=621)   The flow of expansion and contraction itself will begin to move your lips and tongue for 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=629)   you. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=630)   And you'll discover that magically powerful and appropriate things are moving across your 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=641)   teeth without you actually quite even knowing until it's too late. 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=649)   But then it's like the magic happened. 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=652)   It takes a long time to train the ability to do that. 
<br>[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=657)   And you have to be willing to somewhat throw caution to the wind and just, as I say, start 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=663)   manifesting. 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=664)   A lot of times people work against themselves in meditation practice because they go into 
<br>[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=671)   like some really deep state and then the bell rings and it's like, oh, I got to reconstitute 
<br>[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=678)   myself in order to be able to deal with the world. 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=682)   Well, that's like wasting what you just did. 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=688)   Okay. 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=689)   It's like, no, the whole idea is you're in this really deep state, you're sort of spacious 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=697)   and disoriented. 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=700)   The bell rings, time to deal with the world. 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=705)   Just continue to be spacious and disoriented and start moving. 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=710)   And yeah, there might be a little awkwardness initially, but you'll discover that all that 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=718)   is needed is the activity of the personality. 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=722)   The somethingness of the ego is not really necessary to navigate the world and to interact 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=734)   with one's fellow beings. 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=736)   So the whole idea is it's like the bell rings and no, don't like, okay, I got to get myself 
<br>[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=741)   in the world solid again. 
<br>[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=744)   No, no, no. 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zpe-azhEZk&t=747)   You just start being space, moving through space and let the manifestation occur. 
<br>
