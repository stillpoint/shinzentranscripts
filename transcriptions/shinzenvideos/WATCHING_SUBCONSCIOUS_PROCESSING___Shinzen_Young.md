<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=0)   But, but, but, there's another possibility. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=12)   And this one is yet another subtlety, but it is so cool once you get it. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=20)   Okay, and I'm not sure this is what you're talking about, but it's something that I have 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=25)   to talk about. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=28)   Okay, so sometimes I'll be working with a first timer, and they're doing focus in, and 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=37)   they elect to do it with inclusive noting. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=40)   It's just, I give them the option, and it's like, hey, you know, it's going to be sort 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=44)   of complicated. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=45)   No, it's natural. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=46)   I want to do it that way. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=49)   Right? 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=50)   So we're doing see in, hear in, feel in, see hear in, see feel in, hear feel in, all in, 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=62)   gone, or all rest, gone. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=69)   And the person reports this. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=77)   It's not all rest. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=82)   It's not, but I can't tell you whether, what it is. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=91)   Okay, I can't say it's see in, hear in, feel in, or what combination, but it's not all 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=98)   rest. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=99)   It's not that there's no image, no talk, no emotion in the body. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=104)   It's not all rest, but I can't tell you what's going on. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=111)   Sounds like a problem, but actually it's not a problem. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=117)   It's the beginning of something really cool. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=124)   What's happening, so what you say is, okay, you're not aware of explicit image, talk, 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=135)   or emotional body, but those spaces are also not in a restful state. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=145)   What's going on? 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=146)   Well, what do you think is going on? 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=151)   Sub-processing. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=155)   Subconscious processing. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=157)   So the whole Western psychological tradition is based on Freud's quote, discovery of the 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=165)   subconscious. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=166)   Well, guess what? 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=168)   People in India knew about the subconscious two, three thousand years before there was 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=174)   a Freud in Europe. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=179)   And they knew how to observe the subconscious in real time. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=185)   Now you can't observe the subconscious visual, auditory, and somatic the way you observe 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=191)   the conscious, because by definition it's subconscious. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=198)   However you can be aware when a burst of activity arises in subconscious thought and emotion, 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=208)   and you can be aware when that burst of activity passes. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=214)   How are you aware of that? 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=216)   Well sometimes you're aware because of a shimmering on the screen that tells you that the Rolodex 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=226)   is being flipped through deep down, where there's this sort of undercurrent of talk. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=232)   It's massively parallel, like listening to a room full of people. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=236)   You can't make out any strand of a conversation, but you know stuff's going on down there. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=243)   Same for this sort of like idling in your emotional centers. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=249)   Nothing's engaged. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=250)   You can't say it's anger, fear, sadness, but the emotional centers are sort of on idle. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=258)   You can actually see it in a baby. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=260)   You can see the amoeba that is the idling of the limbic circuits in a baby. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=270)   The baby's not crying. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=272)   The baby's not smiling, okay, but the baby's sort of... 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=279)   That's their body responding to the sub-threshold activations of the limbic system, okay, that's 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=290)   just expanding and contracting. 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=292)   Well, it's still there in adults. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=294)   So one way that you can know, that you can monitor in real time these systems is by noting 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=301)   sort of subtle activity, subtle flow within them. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=305)   However, this is the part that's really cool and really subtle. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=313)   You may not even be aware of that undercurrent of something, but you're aware that image 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=321)   space is tugging you. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=326)   Talk space is tugging you. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=330)   Emotional feeling space is tugging you, but there's no awareness of any activity, but 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=336)   there's an awareness of a tug of space. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=339)   That's why it's so important to have a sense of the locations of the spaces. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=347)   So when you're doing focus in and it's not all rest, you will notice that the non-rest 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=356)   is that you're being tugged towards one, two, or all three of those spaces. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=362)   That is the cue that there is a very... 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=366)   At that instant, the subconscious mind has started to activate in one, two, or all three 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=374)   of those spaces. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=376)   And you note that as seeing, hearing, feeling, even though... 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=380)   Okay, so it's not all rest. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=383)   There's no explicit activity that you're aware of, not even a vibratory flow, but there is 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=389)   this tug. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=390)   That's why this triangle, okay? 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=394)   There's a tug here, there's a tug here, there's a tug down here, or all three at once, or 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=402)   what have you. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=403)   That tug, when your emphasis is on detecting interactivity, that counts as the subtlest 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=411)   level of interactivity. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=413)   And you just say yes. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=415)   Even though you don't know what you're saying yes to, you say yes to the tug. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=419)   And guess what? 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=422)   At some point, that's all that the subjective system needs. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=427)   It just needs you to say yes to its amoeboid subliminal flux. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=434)   And you go back to that state of the baby. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=437)   And that's the extent to which the ego needs to be a thing for you, which ain't much of 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=444)   a thing. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=447)   This was hugely subtle. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=450)   Don't worry. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcWUfIhToDw&t=451)   I'll say it again and again and again. 
<br>
