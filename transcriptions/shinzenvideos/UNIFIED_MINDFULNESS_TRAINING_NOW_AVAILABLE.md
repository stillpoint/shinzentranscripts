<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=0)   Hey there, it's Juliana and I am extremely excited today because it is the official launch 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=7)   day of the Foundations program. 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=10)   We are rolling and I couldn't be more excited about it for a couple of reasons. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=16)   I know that there is really nothing like this out there right now and I know that for two 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=23)   reasons. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=24)   One, Xin Zhen's framework, the depth of it, the scope of it, the clarity, the precision, 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=32)   the thoroughness. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=34)   He has done the work for all of us, both in terms of having a breadth of experience in 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=42)   his own training, being familiar with so many different contemplative approaches, having 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=49)   a scholarly approach, so understanding world contemplative practices on that level, having 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=57)   a scientific rigor because he partners with hard science to do research around practice. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=68)   So that gives us a tremendous framework to lean on and it makes our job as trainers so 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=75)   much easier. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=77)   So there's that. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=78)   But then there's also the fact that, and maybe actually this is connected, there's the fact 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=83)   that in this space right now you either have to take a deep dive into practice, go whole 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=90)   hog and get certified and spend years in training and years in the certification process, which 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=98)   is totally amazing and honorable. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=101)   But the flip side of that is there really isn't anything other than that track. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=106)   So anybody who is in a helping profession and would maybe like to, for example, a psychotherapist 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=112)   offering it as a complimentary practice for their patients, not their main thing, but 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=117)   something they'd like to share because they think it would be useful. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=121)   So anyone basically who's in a helping profession or in a position to share it who would like 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=125)   to, they're on their own. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=128)   You don't really have any kind of framework to lean on. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=131)   You have to just kind of watch other teachers do it and gather from that how to do it yourself. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=138)   There isn't anything out there right now that speaks to you if you are either kind of less 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=144)   experienced or you're in a helping profession and you want to offer it just as part of what 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=151)   you do or even if you're more experienced, but you don't necessarily want to take a deep 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=157)   dive into a full-on certification program. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=162)   So I'm excited because this offers you a framework so that you can get the support you need in 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=170)   offering other people this training. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=174)   And lastly, it helps you go deeper with your own practice because you bring that level 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=179)   of clarity then in order to be able to tell someone else about it, you really have to 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=183)   know what's going on inside you as you do your practice. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=188)   So very powerful on all those levels. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=191)   Very happy that we've made this available. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTYsH_e-08&t=194)   And today is the opening day.
