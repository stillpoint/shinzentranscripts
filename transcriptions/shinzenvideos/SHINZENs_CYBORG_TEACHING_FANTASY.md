<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=10)   Got another one? 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=11)   Oh, sorry. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=12)   It's okay. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=13)   And there's five more mics over here we'd like you to wear. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=22)   Actually, I'm looking forward to the day when there's just a tablet up here and all these 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=33)   recorders here. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=37)   No teacher, no students. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfBfic0F8lM&t=47)   So maybe that'll be in the cyborg future.
