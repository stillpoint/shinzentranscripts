title: "*5. WORKING with INTENSE EMOTION - GUIDED MEDITATION  (2 of 2)"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=0)   Able to get a little sense of that? 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=24)   Oh yeah. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=26)   So that's a catharsis, a releasing of fear. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=32)   It creates this kind of center of this, it's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=40)   center but then I get really hot. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=43)   Yeah, let the joy be there, let the heat be there. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=46)   These are all reactions to the catharsis. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=50)   And if the heat produces more fear, then just dissipate that in the fear. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=56)   Accept that we're going to let go of the fear now and go to the sadness. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=61)   And don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=65)   Same procedure, start with the periphery of the sadness flavor, work with that, see if 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=74)   it's amenable through a zoom out process to an experience of a global flow in the sadness. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=84)   If that's feasible, do that and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=91)   and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness if indeed that's sort of doable 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=97)   at this time. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=98)   I'd like you to explore the doability of that with regards to sadness. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=104)   Just give it some time. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=127)   Ever able to get a little hint of that? 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=130)   Yeah, since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread, I just kind of instead 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=138)   of, since I didn't quite have the subtle area, I just went around the boundaries of it. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=144)   That's exactly correct. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=146)   That corresponds to the subtle, it's just less widespread. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=150)   That was a good move. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=151)   I just made the boundaries soft and then treated that like... 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=154)   That's right, that's what I would have had you do. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=155)   So you're able to get a little sense of that. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=158)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=159)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=160)   Now, I'm going to have you do a fairly intricate concentration where you're going to attempt 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=174)   to experience simultaneously a kind of river of fear and a kind of river of sad that flow 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=188)   through each other, interpenetrating without interfering. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=196)   So it's almost like... 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=197)   Could you say that again? 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=198)   Oh yeah, right. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=200)   There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like giant liquid drop that's sort of expanding 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=207)   and contracting, right? 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=209)   Right. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=210)   And there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same essential dance. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=214)   Right. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=215)   Now, you know how in a ghost movie you see that the ghost can walk through the wall, 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=226)   right? 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=227)   Right. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=228)   The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=233)   Now imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=239)   both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=246)   each other when they occupied the same place at the same time. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=253)   So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavored 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=259)   sad, and they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=266)   of them can occupy the same place. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=271)   So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=278)   each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=284)   Does this metaphor make sense? 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=287)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=288)   Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=292)   Not in this, not this round. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=294)   This may be the part of the missing piece, because you could get them individually to 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=300)   flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=304)   Because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=310)   interfering, then they won't multiply together into overwhelm. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=319)   So the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=326)   flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=333)   that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=345)   body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=350)   Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=354)   It's an interesting intimacy between them. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=362)   It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=367)   And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=374)   purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=434)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=445)   How's that coming? 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=448)   Good. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=449)   Good. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=450)   Good in what sense? 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=455)   When I can allow them both to share the same space and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=466)   them separate and keeping that line between them, and when I allow them to just kind of 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=472)   do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, a very intense version of that, 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=481)   and then it kind of seems to ignite this PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=488)   So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=494)   Yes, I am. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=496)   This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive, but your facial expression 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=501)   proves it. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DsdjDj_U4U&t=502)   Yeah. 
<br>
