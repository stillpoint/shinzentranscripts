<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=0)   How do you describe the book? 
<br>[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=6)   Well, it's very hard to put into words. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=13)   That's why most teachers don't talk about this stuff, right? For very good reason. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=18)   Because it can be described a lot better than the books tell you it can be described. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=24)   But it cannot be perfectly described. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=30)   I could try to amplify it, but it's going to be explaining the obscure with the even more obscure. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=39)   That's okay. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=40)   Yeah, I'll do it. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=41)   But do it anyway. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=45)   I'm going to do it anyway. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=47)   I'm actually doing it as we're speaking. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=49)   I have a line. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=53)   There's a word in Latin that describes it, believe it or not. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=63)   But it is so esoteric that almost no one has ever heard this word. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=74)   The only reference that you will find to this word is if you look up the Ecstasy of St. Teresa, 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=87)   which refers to a piece of sculpture that was done in the high Renaissance, in the Baroque period, by Bernini. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=101)   It's this great classic thing from the Counter-Reformation. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=107)   Catholic art is very dramatic. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=113)   So it's St. Teresa experiencing pervasive gone. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=128)   But of course, how do you express that in a work of art that's going to emotionally grip people? 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=137)   Well, she's shown swooning. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=144)   It was a hugely controversial work of art. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=149)   People were very annoyed by it, and I'm talking about back in the 1600s, I guess, because it's very sensual. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=168)   Let's just put it at that. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=170)   Anyway, what's happening is she's out, and there's this angel on her chest, and he's pulling out this arrow. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=186)   He's not stabbing her, he's actually removing the arrow. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=192)   What happened before the arrow going through, that's called transverberation. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=202)   It's when the source creates a wormhole from itself through time, space, self, and world, and back to itself. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=221)   Right now, there's a wormhole. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=223)   It starts back here, goes through here, goes right through the center of your head, and out the other way. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=230)   Part of me is looking through that wormhole, and it absolutely sees nothing. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=236)   It's just void to void. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=239)   But all around that is the color and form I need to interact. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=244)   I really appreciate that. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=246)   All I can say is, if that makes any sense to anyone, then I salute you. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=258)   I just love that word, like God's arrow that goes through the time-space continuum. 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=265)   Of course, how wide is that channel? 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=268)   Well, if that channel attains a certain width, you will enter nirodha samapatti, infused contemplation, and you're out, out, out. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=279)   Maybe three days. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=281)   No movement, no perceptible breath, etc. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=287)   To follow up, as a continuum, then, the degree to which you are the unfixated wormhole, and the degree to which there is a recognition of— 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=305)   Is a movable feast. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=307)   Yes, so that's the new paradigm, God's wormhole. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=320)   It's called transverberation, if you're interested. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=324)   It's just an odd word for meaning when God shoots an arrow through you. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=332)   I also really enjoyed your saying what your day was. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=337)   What I heard you say is that sometimes you live without source. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=344)   That sent me to your book to look up the word source, and there are many recommendations in your book to read about source. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=355)   How do you live without source during your day? 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=361)   The same way I did before I started to meditate, because it's just the experience of an ordinary person that doesn't know how to meditate. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=372)   The only difference is I don't care. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=375)   I have no preference between being in a deep state or just being agitated and bopping around, taking care of business. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=385)   Actually, St. Teresa explained it perfectly. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=391)   She said, it's a window, it's open all the time, but—well, not really. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=398)   Sometimes it closes, but you don't care because you know it's going to open again. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=403)   And you know that with such certainty that you don't even care. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=410)   I have a question. The transverberation that you described the other day, the God's arrow kind of coming through with the shaft, did that for you— 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=421)   did that happen—we did a video on YouTube about key moments for you, and you talked about the first one where you reached around and realized your boundaries weren't there anymore. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=432)   Did that happen just suddenly that day, or is this something that evolved over time? 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=439)   It took 20 years from the first breakthrough. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=442)   The first breakthrough was that day? So it was 20 years after that? 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=447)   That I started to get the transverberation. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=450)   And did it slowly develop? 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=452)   Yes, slowly. First just a hint, then more and more salient. 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnLDtHLymo&t=458)   Got it. Thank you.
