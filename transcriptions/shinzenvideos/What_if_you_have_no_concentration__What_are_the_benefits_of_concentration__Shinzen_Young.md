title: "What if you have no concentration?  What are the benefits of concentration? ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=0)   What if you don't have any concentration? I know it helps build it, but what if you 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=11)   don't even have enough to stay, keep your focus there for five seconds? 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=18)   Well, everybody has to start somewhere. If you think of the analogy to a workout, 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=29)   if you've never worked out, the very first time you work out, you get winded in like 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=36)   two minutes, right? And it's like, oh my God, at this rate, I'll never get anywhere. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=42)   What you don't realize is that the growth is not linear. It's somewhat hockey stick, 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=51)   so that you grow faster as you grow more. So it's true initially that you might very 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=60)   well have the experience that you're describing, which is just like, I'll never get this because 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=66)   I, you know, it's like I'm here 1% of the time and 99% of the time I'm like lost in 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=76)   ruminations and worrying about, you know, body sensations, sounds, memory, plan, fantasy. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=85)   That's my memory, plan, fantasy, reaction, judgment. When I decided I was going to like, 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=92)   okay, I'm going to be healthy, I'm going to run. So I was 21 years old, but I'd never 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=97)   really worked out or done anything. I ran down the block and at the end of the block, 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=101)   I'm like, and it's like, oh my God, I mean, I'll never be able to run more than a block. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=109)   But within two months, I was running miles, right? It was a dramatic change. So initially, 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=117)   yes, you may have to put up with that. But everyone has to start somewhere. Another way 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=123)   to look at it is if you never start, then you'll have to live your entire life in a 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=129)   scattered state, an unrecollected state, as the Christians would say. You know, I quoted 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=135)   T.S. Eliot before. He's got this great phrase where he says, this is a place of disaffection, 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=147)   meaning ordinary experience, right? This is a place of disaffection. Then he goes on and 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=153)   eventually says, distracted from distraction by distraction. People are so distracted, 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=159)   they don't even realize they're distracted. So distracted from distraction by distraction. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=166)   That's how you're going to have to live your whole life and it's going to be time to die 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=169)   really quick. And then you will not have lived and you'll freak out. So you've got to start 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=176)   somewhere. So the bad news is, yes, you might have to put up with what you're describing 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=182)   for a while, like getting a stitch when you first try to work out, but things get better 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=188)   with practice. If you don't do something like that, you'll basically just live your life 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=196)   just in that distracted state, meaning you won't really live your life. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=200)   Meaning you're not focusing on what's relevant back to your concentration model? 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=207)   Exactly. You can either say, oh my God, this is awful. I'm able to focus 10% of the time 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=216)   and 90% of the time I'm away. So you can make that a problem or you can make that an insight. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=223)   You can realize, oh, this is how most people live. This is how I would have lived otherwise. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=231)   So you're never really being present. You're spending the present thinking about the past 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=236)   and the future. Essentially, that's the human condition at 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=240)   least at this point in history. What that means is that people don't fully live each 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=249)   moment and therefore they don't really live. If you discover when you first attempt to 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=256)   meditate that it's nine to one, one unit of focus versus nine unit of distraction, that 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=267)   means that you're missing 90% of your life. That's the bad news. When it comes time 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=274)   to die, you won't have lived and you'll freak out. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=277)   On the other hand, the good news is with practice, you can get it reversed. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=282)   Does it take two months like it did for you to run two miles? 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=285)   No, it takes longer typically. Six months to a year of regular practice. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=291)   What's regular? I would say 10 minutes each day and at least 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=295)   four hours of intensive continuous practice per month. That's why I have the home practice 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=300)   program so people can call by phone wherever they are in the world. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=304)   Oh, I was going to ask you about that later. Maybe we should finish up this one thought. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=309)   The bad news is that you may have what might be called a sobering realization when you 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=317)   first try to meditate, which is it's like I say, it's 90% of the time I'm unable 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=328)   to focus. Well, with enough practice, you can eventually reverse that. You're 90% focused. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=340)   You've basically multiplied your ability to be present by a factor of nine. That means 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=350)   you get to live life nine times as big as the average human being. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=355)   When it comes time to die, you will have participated enough in life that you won't freak out. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=363)   You will have completed your life activity. If I were to tell a person, hey, give me 10 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=370)   minutes each day, subtract 10 minutes each day from your life and every month subtract 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=376)   four hours and keep that up for the duration and you'll be able to live to be 300 years 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=386)   old. Well, that would be something like amazing, right? 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=393)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=394)   That's not possible. You can't add 100 and 200 and however many years to a person's 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=403)   life. However, what you can do is multiply your ability to be present in each moment 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=412)   and you can do that dramatically. As the result of that, you'll get to live life two, three, 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=418)   four times as big as you would otherwise. The effect will be the same richness as though 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=426)   you live to be 100, 200 or 300. That's actually doable by anyone. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=432)   Formal meditation practice subtracts a little bit of time from your life, but it multiplies 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=438)   the richness and depth of the rest of the time. As we say, do the math. It's a good 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9OP1YS7e-c&t=445)   deal.
