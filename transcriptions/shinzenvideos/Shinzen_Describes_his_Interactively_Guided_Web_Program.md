<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=0)   Yes? 
<br>[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=3)   I'd like to request another level of training based on the grid. 
<br>[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=8)   I'm thinking back when I started to learn Aikido, there would be drill on a particular 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=12)   practice and then drill on another practice. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=13)   It was up to me to choose what I wanted to practice. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=14)   I tended to just choose the ones I liked best. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=15)   How about as either a constantly available web page or a downloadable program, you could 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=16)   put in total length of the session, for example, and then you could change the length of the 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=18)   session, the length of the session, and the length of the session, and the length of the 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=19)   session in the course. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=20)   How about, with the same application, you could do a guide training program. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=21)   How about as either a constantly available webpage or a downloadable program, 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=27)   you could put in total length of the session and change time, 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=31)   and then it would randomly say, 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=33)   feel in, do nothing, see out, things like that, 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=38)   so you had to learn to keep changing. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=40)   You'll see great minds. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=42)   It's great. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=46)   The program has set sequence, 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=48)   it has free choice, and it has random call. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=52)   It's already written in the program. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=54)   Is it downloadable? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=57)   No, the text has been recorded, 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=63)   the flowcharts and the logic is completely done. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=68)   We're in the process of editing the files 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=72)   and coding the program. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=77)   But all my work is done. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=79)   I recorded everything, including it has that feature, 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=83)   and my term for it in the program, I call it, 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=86)   that you can have a random call. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=89)   And the very parameters that you mentioned are clickable in the program. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=95)   That's wonderful. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=96)   That's like Randori in Aikido. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=98)   Randori. I forgot about Randori. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=101)   Yeah, we're going to call it Randori. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=104)   What does that mean? 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=109)   Randori? 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=110)   We charged to find out what that means. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=116)   Charlie, explain Randori in Aikido. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=126)   It means instead of working with one person attacking you 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=129)   for your higher level test, 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=131)   several black belts are attacking you simultaneously 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=135)   and you have to be still standing at the end of five minutes. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=138)   You've got to pay a lot of attention and flow. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=145)   See, Ran actually, it's funny because it does mean random, 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=149)   but that's just a coincidence. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=151)   It's nothing related to English word. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=153)   Randori means to take, 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=154)   so it's like you're taking on at random, 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muckboZ5LFg&t=157)   literally in Japanese.
