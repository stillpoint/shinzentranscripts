title: "LATE NIGHT SITTING CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=0)   So, yaza, it means night sitting or extracurricular sitting. It's a tradition. At a lot of retreats 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=20)   I give a whole talk about strategies for doing it and why people do it. So maybe I can give 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=29)   you the executive summary. At night there's an alternation of brain chemistry that occurs 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=39)   and that can sort of give you an interesting perspective from which to do the practice. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=50)   Different themes tend to come up. For one thing, each wave of sleepiness induces a wave 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=59)   of rest. That's why people lurch because actually what's happening is there's physical relaxation. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=68)   So you can get into a rhythm where if you happen to be sleepy, you won't necessarily 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=73)   be sleepy, but you may be at some point sleepy. What happens is that you notice how the sleepiness 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=80)   comes in waves. Each wave will tend to cause the body to physically relax and it could 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=89)   also cause sea rest and hear rest. It could turn off the mental talk and it could cause 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=96)   either bright light or darkness, sort of an undifferentiated visual experience. So at 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=104)   least feel rest and perhaps also see rest and hear rest get triggered rhythmically by 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=115)   rhythmic waves of sleepiness. Now if you can sort of get into that rhythm, then what happens 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=121)   is you're re-engineering the experience of sleepiness into the experience of meditative 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=129)   absorption. Because there's something, if you've read about, if you've read sort of 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=135)   the Abhidharma or Buddhist scholasticism, there's something called the Bhava-Anga-Solta. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=144)   So Bhava means existence, Anga means support or underpinning and Solta means stream. So 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=153)   what is the Bhava-Anga-Solta? Well, that's the boundary zone between the conscious mind 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=160)   and the unconscious mind. Now in meditative absorption and in falling asleep and in dying, 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=171)   in those three circumstances, we dip below the Bhava-Anga-Solta. So there's an intimate 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=179)   link between those three things. And the ability to drop below the Bhava-Anga-Solta and not 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=188)   lose consciousness is a big deal. In fact, to live and function below the Bhava-Anga-Solta 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=200)   is to solve the koan that I'm going to give you, actually. I just gave away the answer. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=211)   Living like ordinary life below the stream of existence would mean that you're alive 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=224)   in the unborn, you're functioning from the unborn. So all-night sitting is an opportunity 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=236)   to explore dipping below that boundary zone. Now, if you dip unconsciously, then you're 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=245)   going to have the Zen lurch, okay. But if you get into the rhythm that I'm describing, 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=252)   it will just take you deeper and deeper. Let's see if I can remember. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=259)   Ani yeshana velebi il. That's how you say it in Hebrew. I learned that last time in 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=272)   Israel. Ani, I, yeshana, sleep, velebi, and or but, my heart, my consciousness, il, is 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=288)   awake. I sleep but my heart waketh. It's from the Psalms. The Latin is ego dormio sed cor 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=297)   meam vigilant. And that was used as an ideal by the Christian monks in the Middle Ages 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=307)   when Latin was the language that was used. The canonical hours that the monks keep, which 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=315)   we still have remnants in our language in words like matinee and noon, okay. It's known 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=324)   as the ninth hour, etc., etc. Matins is the afternoon, maybe the morning, lods. I can't 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=335)   remember. There's a certain set number of hours that the monks kept and very few orders 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=345)   still do this, but a few do. And essentially, it's like a radical disruption of the sleeping 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=353)   cycle because they never get more than a few hours sleep and then they have to go to the 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=358)   chapel and either do chanting or singing or have a liturgy of some sort or mass or something. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=372)   And I think it's like seven times in a 24-hour cycle. So, it's like they waken up in the 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=379)   middle of the night, well, they're just sleepy all the time. And that's a lifestyle thing. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=384)   It never varies, ever. So, what's that all about? Why be sleepy all the time? Why never 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=391)   get any continuous sleep for your whole life? Well, for that reason, ego dormio sed cor 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=403)   mea vigile, you learn how to bring consciousness into sleep. So, it's not sleep anymore. What 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=411)   is it? Well, in Christianity, it was called infused contemplation. But in Buddhism, it's 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=418)   called formless jhana. So, one way to go about that that's used in Zen and obviously also 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=428)   was used in Christianity is to re-engineer the sleepiness thing. So, one facet is you 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=436)   can sort of ride it into these delicious restful states. Of course, it takes a little practice, 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=443)   like a lot of practice. So, I'm not guaranteeing that you will experience I sleep but my heart 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=451)   awakens. And tomorrow morning, be enlightened and live the rest of your life in the unborn. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=460)   But you can take some sort of step in that direction. Now, I'm sort of convincing myself 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=470)   that I should join you. Look what Choshin's doing. She started that. She knew this was 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=478)   because she was shaking her head even before she knew that I was like convincing myself 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=484)   that I want to do this. Well, now you probably think I'm a wimp, right? That I can't do it. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=494)   Well, prove it. It's like the army, right? Sir, could you do that? You know, you're supposed 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=503)   to be able to ask your sergeant to do anything he asks you to do, etc. etc. But, now I'm 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=511)   really convincing myself. Well, the truth is you deserve my A game tomorrow, which may 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=523)   not manifest if I'm too sleep deprived. I can still function, but maybe not the A game 
<br>[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=533)   function. Okay, so, but other things come up. It's not just explore the restful states. 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=544)   You may never get mental images. Well, at three in the morning, maybe you have mental 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=548)   images. Dreamscape starts to replace the landscape. And that could be, oh, well, image space is 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=557)   never available to me. Well, maybe it'll be available at three this morning. So that could 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=562)   be a little window of opportunity. The world is solid. Well, at three in the morning, maybe 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=568)   it won't be so solid as your eyes swim. Now, you might say, well, that's bullshit because 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=574)   that's just, you know, you're just tired and that's an optical illusion. But it's also 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=580)   a place to stand to explore visual experience. And if you do an awful lot of that, it will 
<br>[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=587)   give you insight into the impermanent nature of see out. That's there when you're quite 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=593)   recovered and looking quite normally at the world, you still have this knowledge of flow 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=603)   within that experience. So a whole lot of interesting things can happen as a result 
<br>[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=608)   of the yaza. So there are reasons to do it. There is also, of course, you know, it can 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=617)   sometimes be uncomfortable. Physically, there's this icky, sticky, creepy, crawly, sort of 
<br>[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=625)   like yucky on your face, right? Coagulated yucky and sort of excruciating yawniness that 
<br>[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=635)   just sits in your chest hour after hour after hour. And then there could be all sorts of 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=641)   emotions that come up because we're in a little non-composementus. I mean, it is the classic 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=649)   way to break people down, right? Brainwashing and so forth. So now I'm giving you the answer. 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=654)   You're really selling it now. What kind of sales pitch is this? Who wants to buy this 
<br>[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=661)   product? However, people that are committed to this practice know that there is such a 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=670)   thing, there is a thing called working through stuff. And the same process that breaks people 
<br>[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=680)   down also can break people up, if you follow the distinction. To be broken down is a 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=690)   disempowering experience of abuse. To be broken up is an empowering experience of abuse. 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=700)   You're broken down, it means you're like shattered glass. Broken up, you're like a 
<br>[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=711)   spray of pure steam that now joins the flow of nature forever. So anyway, I didn't intend 
<br>[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=732)   to talk about Yaza, but let me just give those of you that have never done it, first-timers, 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=740)   I'm going to give you a reality check. How many people in this room have done an all-night 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=745)   set? How many people in this room have done it again? So you can see this is not like, 
<br>[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=755)   oh my god, no one could do this kind of shit kind of thing, right? So there you go, that's 
<br>[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64BBTV3FOc4&t=765)   my Yaza rap, extemporized. 
<br>
