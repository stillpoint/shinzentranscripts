<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=0)   an art, for example, piano playing or the martial arts or dancing, they might approach 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=14)   the art in a way that not only do they become extraordinarily focused while they're doing 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=20)   their art, but that there's a carryover into daily life and they notice month after month, 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=26)   year after year, as the result of having done that art in a certain way, their base level 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=33)   of focus in daily life has changed. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=36)   So even though they're not calling it meditation, it is de facto a meditation. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=43)   So if I do that, I don't have to actually do regular meditation, I can just do my ballet 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=48)   or piano? 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=49)   Well, yes, but there's a tricky point because the issue is not do you become extraordinarily 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=56)   focused while you're doing the endeavor. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=60)   That's not that uncommon. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=63)   What is much less common is that there's a carryover and you notice in daily life, in 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=71)   other activities, that because of the way you're doing your art, that every moment of 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=78)   your life is being informed by an elevated sense of focus. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=83)   That's fairly unusual, but that is zen and the art of. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=87)   You may have heard that expression, zen and the art of archery, zen and the art of flower 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=92)   arranging tea. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=93)   Is that in the zone too? 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=95)   Yes and no. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=96)   No? 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=97)   It is yes in the sense that there is this locker room or sports term to be in the zone. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=103)   And that is the term that's used for entering a state of extraordinary concentration, say 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=111)   during your performance of sport. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=113)   And of course, it's highly desirable. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=116)   The baseball player, Ted Williams, used to say he knew he was in the zone when he could 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=123)   see the pitch coming at him. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=127)   He could see the stitches on the ball and those pitches come at like 100 miles an hour, 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=132)   right? 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=133)   So sports people call that in the zone. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=136)   Once again, it's not entirely uncommon for somebody to, quote, enter the zone during 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=141)   their performance. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=143)   What is uncommon is that they do it in such a way that there's a carryover into daily 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=148)   life. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=149)   There has to be the carryover. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=151)   Remember I defined the common denominator of meditation is, well, not just concentration, 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=157)   but your base level of concentration. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=159)   When you're not trying to be concentrated, what are you like in daily life? 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=165)   To count as meditation, something has to consistently elevate your base level of concentration. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=174)   So anything that does that is a meditation, whether it's called meditation or not. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=180)   But it's not just a matter of you get concentrated while you do it. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=184)   It's a matter of you get concentrated while you do it in a way that it retrains your ordinary 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=190)   perceptions. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=193)   So that's why I'm very specific about elevate your base level, because it's not uncommon 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=198)   that a person will become extraordinarily focused in some endeavor. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=204)   It is, however, relatively uncommon that that carryover into daily life in a dramatic way 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=211)   that grows consistently with time. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=215)   Without special instruction, usually that doesn't happen. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=219)   They just have it spontaneously, but there's not the effect on life. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=223)   So that's why you actually do these formal meditation techniques and practices, because 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=227)   that more directly elevates that base level? 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=231)   Well, yes. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=232)   In other words, we can imagine, based on your line of questioning, that there could be some 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=239)   ordinary activity you're doing as a meditation. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=242)   And then there could be some special exercises that you do that usually involve sitting still 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=249)   and focusing in some way and whatever, and you do those. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=253)   Now in either case, you could have an elevation of your base level of concentration, and that 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=259)   elevation needs to grow dramatically with time. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=263)   If that's the case, then either of those count as meditation. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=267)   But usually people that get spontaneously focused, unless somebody points out to them 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=273)   that it is necessary and possible to carry this over in daily life, they usually don't. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=280)   So it becomes a dead end, and it's not really a meditation, even though they may become 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=284)   very much in the zone while they perform their sport or their art. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=289)   So in theory, you don't have to do systematic formal exercises that involve sitting and 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=295)   that kind of thing, in theory. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=297)   But probably... 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=298)   Reality. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=299)   But probably, if you want to do it through an art, you probably will still need some 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=305)   coaching into how to make your art carry over the state of the zone. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=310)   Do you do that? 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=311)   Do you coach people how to turn the art into being in the zone? 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=315)   Yeah, I can do that. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=316)   Oh, that's cool. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=317)   I can coach a person to make their running or their singing, what have you. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=326)   I can coach them so that they get the carry over. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=330)   But more typically, people will also do formal meditation practice, sitting in silence and 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=339)   so forth. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=340)   So the upshot is that the common denominator of every form of meditation around the world, 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p4jWtnrJAo&t=346)   inside or outside of religion, would be that they elevate base level of concentration.
