<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=0)   How much does the path one takes towards enlightenment affect the nature of the enlightenment? 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=19)   The quick and easy answer is if you were to focus only on the breath and come to an enlightenment 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=27)   experience through that, it would be essentially the same kind of experience that a person 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=35)   would have if they did a more systematic deconstructive path or if they did a reconstructive path 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=43)   like the Vajrayana path where you sort of create an alternate identity from scratch 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=50)   that's archetypal. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=51)   I would say they all take you to essentially the same type of experience. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=60)   But having said that, the confounding factor is that although it's essentially the same 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=68)   ballpark, enlightenment is like a many-faceted jewel. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=73)   There's so many different sides to it. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=76)   So what side you're going to emphasize may slightly be influenced by what path you took, 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=85)   but not necessarily. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=86)   You might take a certain path there and when you get there, decide to emphasize something 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=91)   quite different in contrast to what the path was that took you there. 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=97)   Also it unfolds with time. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=100)   One of my teachers used to say, 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=102)   今日の悟りは明日の間違い 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=105)   That means today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=109)   Not mistake in the sense of fundamental mistake, but in the sense of, well, Newtonian physics 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=117)   is basically right, but Einstein had something to say. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=123)   And then Richard Feynman had something else to say that built on this. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=131)   So it's like science. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=133)   It's many-faceted. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=134)   So it will present itself to you over the years in different aspects. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=142)   For example, my main teacher, Sasaki Roshi, when I met him, he was already a master's 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=148)   master. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=149)   I mean, he was already a senior Roshi when I first met him. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=154)   He's now 102, 103. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=160)   I've known him for 25, 26 years now. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=165)   Over those two and a half decades, I have seen him evolve and hone his paradigm and 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=174)   change his emphasis. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=176)   So he was already a master's master and he is discovering new facets of this at that 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=182)   level. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=184)   So I would say that the path that you take will somewhat influence how you conceptualize 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=192)   the experience, but it's not necessarily going to constrain it in some way. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=199)   And in fact, you may end up doing something quite different, ending up with quite a different 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=204)   paradigm. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=206)   So I would say it's a matter of depth and what facet you're choosing to emphasize, rather 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYmGdWY5ZWM&t=213)   than a matter of what technique you use to bring you to that.
