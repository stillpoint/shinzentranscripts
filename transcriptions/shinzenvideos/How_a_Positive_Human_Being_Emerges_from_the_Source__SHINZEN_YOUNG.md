title: "How a Positive Human Being Emerges from the Source ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=0)   I was wondering where cultivating positive or identifying positive exists within both 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=17)   gone. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=18)   Well, the question is, where is positive within both gone? 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=24)   It's not. That's sort of the whole point. No positive, no negative. This is as close 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=32)   as you get to the non-human as you can get. However, the great parents, so intrinsically, 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=44)   there is no love, there is no hate there, intrinsically. But still, that's hitting a 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=52)   human being. We're still a human being. And when we get hit by the impersonal, that tends 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=60)   to trigger a sense of deep human love. But it's not intrinsic to the impersonal. It's 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=71)   intrinsic to the fact that you're still a human being. And touching that, which is, 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=84)   as is said, strikes down God and the devil simultaneously. So you would think, well, 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=92)   that's a little bit more like the devil than God. Because it's like, where's ethics, 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=102)   where's love? But that's the central mystery. When the human touches the non-human, the 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=110)   human is nurtured and improved by way of reaction. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=115)   So touching the non-human source is, when you come back, the ripples of love are there? 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=126)   That's pretty much it. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=131)   So then the authentic person is in the source, but not in the ripples of love? 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=140)   Well, the authentic person is the puppeteer. And the puppet that that invisible hand is 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=157)   inserted into very much will be manifesting love and compassion in the world. So it's 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=169)   the power source. You can think of it on an analogy of broadcasting. So there's the wattage 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=185)   of the station. That's power, that's joules per second. That's the rate at which energy 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=196)   is going out. However, the wattage is not the only parameter of a radio or TV station. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=208)   There's a modulation that goes on, on that wattage that carries a message. It could be 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=214)   music, it could be, okay, and it can modulate either amplitude or frequency. But the point 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=219)   is, there's a message that's riding on that energy wave. It's modulated or encoded. But 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=229)   it's not the energy wave itself. The energy wave is just pure energy. So that's inside 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=236)   the puppet, is that energy wave. But the surface of the puppet should be unapproachable, abstract, 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=249)   admirable, helpful human being. That's what I call classical enlightenment, or class C 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=260)   enlightenment, as opposed to crazy wisdom or other things that people do, where the 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=267)   surface is not necessarily unapproachable, admirable, helpful, and ordinary human being. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=278)   So that's how I look at it. So if somebody is in touch with the source and also in touch 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=285)   with being beneficial to other human beings, they're going source here, source here, 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=293)   source here, source here, something like that? Well, you can use different metaphors. You 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=301)   could use an alternating metaphor, but I sort of like the spatial metaphor of there's space 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=310)   inside you that's sort of animating you, anima. There's different possible metaphors. So, 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLshrqxGfJo&t=323)   yeah, that's one way to think about it.
