title: "The Agony of Jargon  ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=0)   We have to deal with the agony of jargon here, because different teachers use different languaging 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=15)   for identical phenomena, and different teachers use identical words for entirely different 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=25)   phenomena. And there's just no way around that. It just is, because everybody sort of 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=32)   develops their own whatever. So it is hugely confusing to people, and I really feel sorry 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=44)   for anyone that hasn't done 30 or 40 years of practice, because it takes 30 or 40 years 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=51)   to see when two people are using the same words for something completely different, 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=58)   and when they're using very different words for something completely the same. It just 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=62)   takes a long time, typically, to develop that kind of sense, that clarity. Now, 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=70)   I don't think this situation is going to go on for many more decades, certainly not for more 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=75)   than a century or two, because we're now dialoguing, the teachers dialogue. They didn't in the old 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=80)   days, everybody had their own feudal domain, and they were just like lords of a castle, 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=88)   and they didn't do open peer-to-peer dialoguing in public, or if anything happened in public, 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=97)   it was just a debate where they were trying to trounce the other guy. And even the Buddha, 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=102)   look at the Buddhist literature, it's just the Buddha defeating one person after another after 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=107)   another with his paradigm. That's what it is. That's what the Pali Canon is about. It's not 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=113)   him talking to other people peer-to-peer, okay? But now things are different. Now there's a 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=123)   different spirit, the spirit of science, the spirit of collegial cooperation, and that will 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=133)   probably gain momentum in the next hundred years or so. And probably we won't have this agony of 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=144)   jargon and seemingly conflicting maps and claims and so forth. But right now, 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=151)   you're at the awkward intermediate period of history. So let me just try to make it as simple 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=160)   as possible. If Daniel or Kenneth says AP, read that as both gone, of Shinsen, end of story. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=173)   Okay? We just, for whatever reasons, have this different language of things. So that may help 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=180)   clarify a little bit. So that deep experience of space spreading and collapsing, 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=188)   as soon as it's arising, okay, that's your AP experiences. And one way to, 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=195)   that means arising, passing in the jargon of some teachers. It corresponds to Udayavya in Pali, 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=206)   and it is mentioned, definitely mentioned in the Pali Canon. And probably in a sense, 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=212)   pretty similar to what those contemporary teachers use it. One way to measure, you know, 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=220)   there's lots of ways to measure progress. See, now in early Buddhism, they measured progress in terms 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=227)   of working through craving, aversion, and unconsciousness. That's the different, you know, 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=236)   stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, arhat, and so forth. That's one metric. There's 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=243)   an alternate metric called the ten oxerting pictures. That gives you a picture of about 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=249)   50 years of practice from the first picture to the eighth, seventh picture. It's hard to see 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=264)   that those two maps correspond to exactly the same thing. You don't see they have anything in common. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=272)   Another way to measure progress is, for how long through what kind of intensity 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=285)   can you have an experience of both gone or rising, passing? That's another way to measure progress. 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P9c57Kki00&t=292)   So, I don't know if that's of any help.
