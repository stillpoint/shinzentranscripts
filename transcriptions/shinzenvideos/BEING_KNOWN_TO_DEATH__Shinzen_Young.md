<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=0)   How about if we took everything as our object? 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=7)   Well, that's actually not that much bigger than mind-body, just sights and sounds. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=15)   Sounds are, people usually find pretty easy. Sight, ah, that's a lot more challenging. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=22)   But with practice you can start to sort of get a complete experience or something near a complete experience of the sights in front of you. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=35)   And that's very rich and also very transparent. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=41)   So it sort of seems like there's just this shaft of knowing that goes from your eyes, 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=56)   I don't know how to describe it, it goes through the back of your head, out through your eyes, 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=63)   out to the farthest regions of the visual space and it's just like this shaft of clarity that, 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=79)   like it bores a wormhole from void to void through the somethingness of the surrounding scene. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=87)   Each time your eye shifts, here, here, here, here, you're actually sort of seeing the world, 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=94)   but you're also seeing the source on, like looking in from all sides at once. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=105)   So it's very rich and very freeing and empty sort of looking. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=117)   It's like, and it's not so much even that you're noting, it's like you're being known by pure consciousness. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=129)   The surrounding scene is being known. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi8Vg3BXNag&t=135)   Known to death.
