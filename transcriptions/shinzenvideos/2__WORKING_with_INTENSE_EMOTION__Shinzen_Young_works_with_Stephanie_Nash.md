<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=0)   A couple more questions. 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=7)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=9)   Is the, which is the source of the greatest distress? Is it the feel or the tension reaction? 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=22)   The feel, absolutely. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=24)   So, you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension reaction. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=28)   No, when the feel, yeah. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=30)   So, the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=36)   Absolutely. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=37)   Okay, that helps me hone in a little bit more on what our target should be. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=43)   Right. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=44)   Have you attempted, well, I should say, as you know, a basic principle in mindfulness is divide and conquer. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=52)   Case in point, you have divided this experience into, okay, there's the emotional body sensations, that's one component. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=61)   Then there's the muscle reactions to those, that's the second component. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=65)   So, that's already a divide and conquer, and that has already given you some relief that the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=77)   As you remember, a second axiom is if divide and conquer doesn't work, remember what I always say, subdivide until you do conquer. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=89)   In this case, have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors, anger, fear, sadness? 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=97)   In other words, have you applied the noting, feeling, flavor technique to this intense arising? 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=107)   Yes, I have. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=109)   What I have found to be more helpful is the investigating where exactly I'm feeling what. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=122)   Is there clenching here, what are the boundaries, is there more pressure in, is it pushing out? 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=130)   The more I'm investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality, that's been a little more successful in helping me go through it. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=142)   But I can tell you the quality. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=144)   The subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the quality, which is the noting, feel, flavor, so that gives you the spectrum, anger, fear, sadness, interest, what have you. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=157)   But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=165)   So, then that would be like... 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=167)   Do you want to stop for one second? 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=168)   No, let's just let go. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=171)   It could happen during a real session. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=177)   So, you can subdivide into flavors, but you can also subdivide into locations. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=183)   So, it's an application of the same principle. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=186)   So, you're saying that subdividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=194)   Yeah, location and quality of sensation. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=199)   You mean, so it's a little of both? 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=202)   Yes. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=203)   Flavor and location, you're getting specific about those. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=206)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=207)   So, you've already made the major thing that I would first try, okay, because you've internalized the algorithm so well. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=217)   And you say that that does help. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=219)   Do you note the location, like with the location word, face? 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=224)   No, I haven't been doing that out loud. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=226)   But you've been tracking the location, and then it sounds like you're staying up for a little while in a location. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=234)   And moving my awareness around inside of it. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=237)   Sort of inventory and see what it's like. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=240)   When I'm inside of it, it's so much easier than when I'm outside of it, for me. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=246)   Well, that, once again, sounds like a pretty optimal strategy. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=252)   Tell me, what are the range of flavors involved? 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=255)   It's primarily a fear flavor, primarily to an almost terror panic. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=264)   Intense fear is the primary? 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=266)   Intense fear, and there's absolutely sadness. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=269)   Fear and sadness. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=270)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=271)   Is there any reason for it, or is it just erupting in the body? 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=276)   I have, like I said, I think there was an event or two that triggered it on the outside, but this was out of proportion to that. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=284)   And I saw that, and as I kind of worked with it, I found that the particular story, the surface story, I even knew, it was silly. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=298)   But as I let go of there needing to be a story, I kind of just went into this huge feel. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=305)   And as I've gone down in layers, I'm seeing kind of flickers of like, oh, fear of annihilation, that I'll be killed in any moment. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=314)   There's not a logical thing to this. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=316)   Yeah, right. In other words, it's not really coming from the object of external order. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=321)   I think it tapped, I think whatever this was on the outside, tapped everything like a magnet. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=328)   I think it drew everything up that resonated at that frequency, and it's just kind of really thrown me at how huge it is. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=337)   And they say in Ohio, huge, you're supposed to say huge. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=341)   But really, it's taken all my technique or skill to be functioning. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=350)   Okay. So we're having a huge upwelling of fear potential and it sounds like sadness. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=360)   Yeah, there's sadness. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=361)   And are they equally strong, the fear and the sadness? 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=365)   I'd say the fear is probably like the fear is the cake and the sadness is icing that's also going down through the cake. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=375)   Oh, I get it. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=376)   To use a food analogy. 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=378)   Actually, that's probably a pretty accurate description because that's what happens. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=382)   They tangle and interact. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=388)   And you say very little mental image or internal talk accompanying this. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=393)   At first there was a lot, but as I go down... 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=396)   It's almost pure body. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=398)   How about very subtle image or talk activation, subliminal, hints of something? 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=404)   The subliminal stuff is where that annihilation came up. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=408)   Okay, that is starting to suggest some strategies. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=413)   Let me ask you further. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=417)   I say annihilation, but the thing that comes up would be killed. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=421)   Like anybody at any moment could kill me. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=425)   It's phobic. It's fear. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=428)   And this is good. You've heard me a million times talk about how before we break through these things, 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=436)   they need to become, my phrase is, continuous and ubiquitous. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=440)   Continuous means unbroken in time. Ubiquitous means everywhere in the body. 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=446)   We're going towards that. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=448)   If that's happening, then a process of permanent purification is happening. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=456)   People, of course, are averse to the notion of letting something like fear or sadness 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=465)   become continuous through time and omnidirectional in the body, ubiquitous in the body. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=473)   But that's penny-wise and pound-foolish, 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=476)   because being unwilling to pass through that temporarily 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=480)   keeps them always with the sort of Damocles of fear hanging over their head, 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=487)   and likewise with the other negatives like sadness, anger, and so forth. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=491)   So you have to reach a point where it's completely irrational, 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=495)   completely over-the-top intense, doesn't stop in time, 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=501)   and is in every cubic centimeter of your body, if not of the known universe, 
<br>[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=508)   in other words, perceived as larger than the body, 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=513)   and say, OK, I would allow this to go on forever. 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=520)   It's at that point that you're getting optimal catharsis, in the sense of cleaning out. 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=527)   So it's taking a while, but I'm getting a clearer picture of what's going on. 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=531)   Just hearing you say that makes me feel better. 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=534)   I mean, I still want to work, but it's kind of just helpful to have somebody say, 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=542)   because I've just been working on it by myself without talking to anyone, 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=545)   and it's very helpful to hear it. 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=547)   It's just helpful to hear that, you know. 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNZ9beyB7tY&t=550)   Yeah, I would say that this is the stage before people become free. 
<br>
