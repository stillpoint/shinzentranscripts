<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=12)   Have you ever been in a situation of extreme danger 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=16)   where time slowed down, everything got peaceful, 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=21)   and you felt extremely focused and without fear 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=26)   and able to respond in a remarkably effective way? 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=31)   When I ask this question to any large group, 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=35)   several people will always raise their hands and say yes. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=40)   One woman described going into a state like this 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=43)   when she almost drowned in California's Kern River. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=48)   As the result of being so tranquil and present, 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=51)   she avoided panic and was able to survive the incident. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=56)   She added an interesting comment. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=59)   If only I could have bottled that state, 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=63)   I could have addicted the world to it. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=68)   People who have experienced this spontaneous state 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=72)   of extraordinary focus often say 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=75)   that it was the most meaningful day of their life 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=79)   and that it changed them forever. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=83)   Sometimes it happens under circumstances 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=85)   of exceptional stress, in sports, in combat, 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=90)   terminal illness, accident, or assault. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=94)   But it can also happen at the opposite end of the spectrum. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=99)   When you're extremely safe and connected, 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=101)   say while walking in the forest alone 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=104)   or during a particularly profound experience 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=108)   of making love, in these circumstances, 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=112)   you again find that time slows down, 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=116)   your mind becomes very peaceful, and you're very present 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=120)   and focused and unified with what's going on. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=126)   What few people realize is that such states of presence 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=130)   and focus are trainable. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=134)   You don't have to wait for unusual or extreme conditions 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=137)   in order to experience them. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=141)   And it doesn't have to be sporadic or short-lived. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=145)   It can be a permanent abode. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=148)   Indeed, any person can live their day-to-day life 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=153)   with that level of focus. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=156)   In other words, a person's baseline of focus 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=160)   can be elevated through systematic practice. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=165)   The discovery that extraordinary focus can be intentionally 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=168)   cultivated is one of the most significant findings 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=172)   the human species has made. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=177)   It has enormous ramifications for both our personal lives 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=182)   and our world. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=186)   The systematic training and focus 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=188)   is called meditation practice. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOyl8mbQUJE&t=191)   It's the basic tool in the science of enlightenment.
