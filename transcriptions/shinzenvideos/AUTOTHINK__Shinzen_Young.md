<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=0)   There's also a technique that I call auto-think, which is a way of training a person to think 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=17)   without thinking. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=18)   Now you might say, well, how in the world do you train someone into that? 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=23)   How do you train the muse to talk to you? 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=30)   How do you train intuition and creativity? 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=36)   Well, it's actually a fairly involved procedure, but I can give you just a brief description. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=48)   It starts with something that anyone can do. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=51)   You track mental activity in terms of four possibilities. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=58)   See, hear, see-hear, and rest. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=65)   So see means you're having a mental image, hear means you're having mental talk. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=70)   See-hear means you're having mental image and mental talk at the same time. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=75)   But rest means that the system is not active, your mental screen is blank and your head 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=82)   is quiet at the same time. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=87)   Or in the most extreme case, it means that both image space and talk space have vanished, 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=94)   mind space has collapsed to a dimensionless point. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=98)   But even if that doesn't happen, you can still be aware of rest or absence of activity, which 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=105)   I describe as the mental screen is blank and the head is quiet. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=109)   So that's a relative rest, and you can also have absolute rest in your mind. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=115)   Otherwise, your mind is active, and that can only happen in one of three ways, image, talk, 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=122)   or both at the same time. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=123)   So you track that, and then you get some momentum, and then you can move to a more challenging 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=131)   procedure, which is to cover mind space. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=135)   Place some attention in image space, some attention in talk space. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=139)   Mind space sort of has a front and a back. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=143)   Images tend, it's a little more complex than this, but they tend to center sort of in front. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=150)   Mental talk tends to be in the head at the ear. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=153)   So just like the body has a front and a back, your mind, roughly speaking, has an anterior 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=160)   and posterior space. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=163)   And so you cover mind space, and you just sort of, Freud would have maybe called it 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=170)   evenly hovering. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=172)   Is that a phrase that he used? 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=174)   So what he used, talking about the outside, we're talking about evenly hovering on the 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=178)   inside. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=179)   So you cover mind space, and that's actually not as easy for most people as noting the 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=187)   mind states, meaning tracking image talk, both or none. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=193)   But if you're able to cover mind space, that could be very useful. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=198)   And then a certain window of opportunity might present itself. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=202)   There might be a global, unfixated state. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=206)   Either it's all rest all the time, or it's active, but it's just a subtle vibration of 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=213)   activity, or there are surface thoughts, but they immediately go away. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=218)   So you're never carried away. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=221)   That's a global, unfixated state. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=225)   Now, if you maintain a global, unfixated state, it may evolve into a situation where you're 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=236)   actually thinking again, but the thoughts are just self-organizing. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=244)   They're just happening on their own, and they're creative, and they're insightful. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=253)   And now you're into a state of auto-think. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=258)   You've actually trained yourself to do that. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=261)   Now that's a window of opportunity. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=263)   If that opens, you use it, but if it doesn't, and you have difficulty covering the mind 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=269)   space, then fine, you just go back to noting the mind states. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=273)   So it's a kind of algorithm that loops and branches, and then with time will tend to 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=280)   induce in a person the ability to think without thinking, or to have thoughts without a thinker, 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h71KpN2h4o&t=287)   that sort of self-organize and carry an energy of creativity and or insight.
