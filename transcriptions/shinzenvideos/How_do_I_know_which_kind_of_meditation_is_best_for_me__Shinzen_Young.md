<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=0)   Meditation is a way to get to know yourself. 
<br>[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=4)   Meditation is a way to get to know yourself. 
<br>[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=8)   Now there's different kinds of meditation. 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=10)   Somebody says, hi, I'm looking at a candle. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=13)   Somebody else is saying, what's the sound of one hand clapping or whatever. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=17)   What's the difference really in them and what distinguishes them or what's an advantage? 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=24)   How do I know which one I want to do? 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=26)   It's a matter of trial and error, I would say. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=29)   Read about the different traditions and you see which way of working appeals to you intellectually. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=37)   You also check out different teachers, see their teaching style, their personality, their emphasis. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=45)   They're all different. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=47)   Some are very heartfelt. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=49)   Some are very intellectually clear and precise. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=54)   Like you? 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=55)   Yeah, I'm more the, as T.S. Eliot would have said, the sharp compassion of the healer's art. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=66)   Maybe a little bit less on the heartfelt side. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=73)   Everybody has their specialty. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=75)   So you check out the intellectual model. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=78)   You check out the personality of the teacher or teachers. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=81)   You can have more than one teacher. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=84)   Is that confusing to have more than one teacher? 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=86)   It depends. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=87)   For some people that is confusing, but some people are naturally bi-spiritual or poly-spiritual. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=95)   You can be bi or poly. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=100)   For those people it's not confusing. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=103)   The main difference in the different meditation traditions is what do they have you focus on? 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=111)   How do they have you build the concentration? 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=113)   Typically, concentration power is built by giving somebody an object to focus on. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=121)   Then when their attention wanders, they bring it back. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=124)   Then it wanders again, and they bring it back over and over again. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=128)   I say typically because there are exceptions where you don't actually have an object that you focus on. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=134)   But that's pretty specialized. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=137)   Most forms of meditation will give you an object. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=141)   By an object, could you tell me what you mean? 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=144)   A sensory experience of some sort. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=147)   I'll give you a range of possibilities. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=151)   Typical sensory experiences a person might focus on are the physical sensations of breathing, 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=158)   which would be a body sensation that is specific and physical. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=167)   The physical sensation of breathing is one common object. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=172)   External sound is another common object. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=175)   You can do it with music, for example. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=177)   Some people do a music-based meditation. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=180)   You focus on music as a meditation. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=183)   Yes, on the sound of the music. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=186)   Another sensory experience could be, as you mentioned, something that's external sight, like a flower or a candle. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=193)   Your attention wanders, you bring it back. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=196)   The object could be an internal sound of a mantra, 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=201)   which is any syllable, word, phrase, sentence that you repeat over and over again. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=206)   That could be an object. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=208)   It could be an internal image. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=211)   For example, some people like to visualize a sphere of light or something like that that they would look at, 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=220)   or a blank extent of brightness or darkness. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=224)   That would be an image-type thing. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=226)   Does it matter which one of these you do? 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=228)   Is there an advantage to looking at a sphere of light versus listening to music? 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=232)   Let me list a few more, and then we'll talk about the relative advantages and disadvantages. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=239)   Let's see. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=240)   We could have touch. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=242)   We could have sight, sound. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=245)   We could have mental image. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=247)   We could have an internal talk, 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=249)   but in the form of a syllable or word or sentence that is repeated over and over again, 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=254)   which would tend to cool out talk space, your internal chattering. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=260)   That's called mantra in Sanskrit, but the Christians used it too. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=264)   Most of the traditions used it. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=268)   That's image talk. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=270)   You could even focus on an emotional sensation, like a pleasant emotional feeling in your body, like love or something like that. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=278)   Certain kinds of physical touches, sight, external sights, external sounds, mental images, 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=285)   certain kinds of internal talk, certain kinds of emotional feel in the body, 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=289)   would be typical objects that a person might take as a concentration. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=295)   Just like everything. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=296)   Potentially anything, because you're training a generic skill. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=301)   It does have to be based on sensory experience. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=305)   You pick a sensory experience, your attention will wander, it will be pulled elsewhere, you bring it back, you wander, bring it back. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=311)   Each time you bring it back, it's like lifting a weight, you're strengthening your muscles, you may get tired, 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=316)   but in the end your muscles get strong if you do that consistently. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=320)   That's how most kinds of meditation work, not every kind. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=325)   There are some formless kinds, but most kinds of meditation will give you an object, 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=331)   your attention wanders, you bring it back. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=333)   As to the advantages and disadvantages, I would say it very much depends on what appeals to you 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=339)   and what works for you as a person. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=342)   So try out different things. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=343)   So would someone move from one to another, like say today I want to listen to music 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=349)   and tune into that experience, and if my mind wanders I come back to the music, 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=354)   and maybe tomorrow I want to watch this light in front of my eyes. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=360)   Or would someone pick one thing that they're doing and that's what you do every day to build this muscle of concentration? 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=367)   That's an excellent question. It depends on the tradition you're working in. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=371)   Because meditations are organized into systems, and each system has an internal consistency that is designed for it. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=386)   So in some systems you'll be encouraged to, like, okay, it can be today this, tomorrow that, 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=393)   based on some sort of algorithm. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=396)   In other systems it will be much more monolithic, no matter what, you always do this kind of thing. 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=402)   Like the breath, I've heard a lot of people who do nothing but watch their breath. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=406)   Then the answer to the question, what should I focus on, is easy, it's always the same, 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=411)   no matter what comes up, gently return to the breath sensation in your abdomen, nostril, wherever. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=418)   So it very much depends on the internal consistency of the meditation system that a person is practicing, 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=426)   and the teacher or teachers will tell you how to make those decisions and why. 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_6-NY2yA_k&t=433)   And every meditation teacher should be willing and able to explain to you why they ask you to do things in a certain way. 
<br>
