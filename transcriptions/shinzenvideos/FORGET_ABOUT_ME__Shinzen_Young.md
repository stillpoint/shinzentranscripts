<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=0)   Shenzhen, thank you so much for giving your time and energy today and always selflessly. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=17)   Well, I appreciate being appreciated. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=20)   You had a teacher once, you were saying that the way to show, you say this at the end of retreats, 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=27)   you say the way to show gratitude, what do you usually say? 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=32)   The best way to show gratitude to you for all you've done. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=37)   I would say a couple of things. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=42)   One is keep up your practice. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=46)   The other is pass it on, as they say. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=54)   In some way or another, either at the subtle level of your vibe and your behavior changes, 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=61)   or at the descriptive level of you can describe your own practice to people, 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=67)   and even though you're not teaching them in any explicit way, they hear what you do 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=73)   and you can give a clear description of what you yourself do, 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=76)   and that's a kind of very important way you can teach people. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=80)   Or maybe at the fully explicit level, you pass it on by becoming a teacher yourself 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=87)   and actually teaching techniques. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=91)   So I would say continue your practice, pass it on. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=95)   And then the other thing I would say, what I would want from people is that they forget about me. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=108)   I would want them to forget about me as a person. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=112)   In other words, I know that sounds shocking and confusing, 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=116)   what I mean is to not link this to a person, an individual teacher. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=125)   There's only one teacher, one thousand-armed goddess of compassion 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=130)   that spans all time and all space, 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=133)   and every individual teacher is just one hand on that, or one face on that, on her. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=143)   And we tend to just, I don't know, we look at the limbs, we don't see the whole goddess. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=153)   So I would want them to forget about me as a person 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=156)   and realize that I'm just one part of this giant activity 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=163)   that has been propagating since prehistoric times. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=169)   So not link it to a particular personality, what you got. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=174)   Just forget about me completely. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=179)   Well, I'm going to express my gratitude. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=183)   I'm going to go out and tell somebody about this and then I'm going to forget all about you. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=188)   I'm happy. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=189)   Not! 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=190)   Well, that's on you. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiKFM3MT5Tg&t=192)   Thanks again.
