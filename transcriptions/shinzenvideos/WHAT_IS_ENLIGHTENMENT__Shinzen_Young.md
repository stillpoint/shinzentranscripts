title: "WHAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT? ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=0)   Can you tell me what enlightenment is? 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=9)   So moment by moment, you've probably noticed that you have thoughts, right? 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=16)   Is that correct? 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=18)   And moment by moment, you've probably noticed that you have body sensations. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=24)   You've also probably noticed that as soon as a thought arises or a body sensation arises, 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=30)   there's a tendency to say, this thought is me, that this sensation is me. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=36)   Is that correct? 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=39)   Nothing mysterious so far. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=42)   The next part, you have to sort of use your imagination. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=46)   Imagine that you still have thoughts and you still have body sensations, but they no longer 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=55)   immediately trapped your identity. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=59)   So your identity is free, free to be inside your mind and body like it was before, but 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=67)   also free to move outside of your mind and body, to inhabit briefly anyone's mind and 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=73)   body, to merge with them, or to embrace the entire universe, or to abide at the still 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=84)   point of the turning world beyond time and space, the nothingness that precedes the Big 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=91)   Bang, so to speak, metaphorically speaking. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=96)   So after enlightenment, people's identity becomes elastic and the mind and body is no 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=107)   longer a place you're locked in. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=112)   It's a home you comfortably can abide in, but you can leave anytime you want. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRtBa4nOO04&t=121)   And that's why we also call it liberation, being set free.
