title: "6. WORKING with INTENSE EMOTIONS  - Discussion & Alternative Strategies"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=0)   I'm recognizing how I've been keeping them separate and keeping that line between them 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=18)   and when I allow them to just kind of do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=25)   the fear, a very intense version of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this kind 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=32)   of PT-like energy up the body and it gets very hot. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=35)   So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=42)   Yes I am. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=43)   This is what most people would say is rather counterintuitive but your facial expression 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=49)   proves it. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=50)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=51)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=52)   It's really interesting though because as it does I find myself wanting to comment on 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=56)   it and I'll go off and talk and then it loses it a little bit. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=63)   Yeah, it's got to be done purely in the body. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=67)   Because the comments and then you know. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=71)   It does trigger some little topics to go, this is all about it. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=75)   That's right, but your use of practice allows you to stop that and not sort of go down in 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=79)   that. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=80)   Well plus there's motivation to kind of stay with this. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=85)   It's intrinsically rewarding. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=87)   Now next step, see if you can have the fear and the sadness dancing with and through each 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=94)   other with your eyes open. 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=97)   And you may find defocusing the eyes initially helpful. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=106)   So we can maintain it somewhat into a more ordinary experience. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=115)   It's interesting when I am, as I kind of go in and out here as I do it, and I'm going 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=125)   to talk while keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm honing in on the one 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=133)   specific place in the body they both share in a powerful way. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=138)   And if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's the red 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=143)   or blue, you know, it kind of helps me maintain it with my eyes open more. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=152)   Good. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=153)   Now see if you can keep some contact with that even after we make some eye contact. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=162)   It may be a little trickier. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=166)   This is what we just did here is probably one of the missing pieces of the solution 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=178)   to the situation that you described. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=180)   I'm not sure it's all of the missing pieces. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=182)   I've got a few other ideas besides this. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=188)   But I think for this session. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=189)   This is a good one. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=190)   For this session, one epiphany is worth the price of admission. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=197)   A little bit of money on the table. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=203)   You haven't done this before, this theme of different flavors. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=207)   Well, I remember interdigitation was a word you used to use. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=211)   And what's so interesting is as soon as you guided me on this, I thought, I'll guide 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=216)   somebody else in this. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=218)   I didn't think of it for me. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=222)   I was just too busy. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=223)   Oh, you remember to do this. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=225)   You remember to get the flavors to do this. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=226)   Oh, I'll have other people do this. 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=229)   Right, but you didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=231)   I was just, my circuits were just so full, I guess. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=235)   Well, you know, that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=242)   to meditation, which is that the assumption is that when people face real challenges, 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=252)   even people without a background in practice, if you interactively guide them, will be able 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=257)   to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=261)   Dramatic, positive experiences. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=266)   It has also been my experience that people that are quite good at meditation, when they're 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=272)   faced with real life challenges, can easily forget. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=277)   But all you need is somebody to do this. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=279)   And it's like, oh yeah, I knew how to do that. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=283)   And then now you're set. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=285)   This is one session. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=288)   We don't need 20 years of therapy here. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=290)   It's like, okay, now you sort of know what to do. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=293)   So I think that's excellent. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=296)   But I will, for subsequent sessions, remind me that I had some other ideas of, well I 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=304)   can actually just tell you. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=305)   Just tell me now and then I can always replay it and go, remember you had this and this. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=309)   So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well, the two flavors have to simultaneously 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=317)   flow and through each other. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=320)   Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=329)   thinking. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=330)   And you might want to look in that direction. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=334)   And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=339)   exercise that, with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=345)   I'll ask you. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=346)   Have we ever done noting feel sources? 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=351)   What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=357)   If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=362)   And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=368)   fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=372)   No, we haven't done that. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=374)   We've mentioned fear, I call that noting feel sources. 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=378)   And feel can be generic or specific. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=382)   That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=386)   Because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering from other 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=392)   senses that are activating the fear in real time. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=397)   And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=403)   How much of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=408)   Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=418)   But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, specifically 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=425)   what's triggering what. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=427)   And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=433)   or emotion in general, but especially fear, literally a few minutes of noting what is 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=441)   triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=448)   So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=455)   fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=461)   stuff. 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=462)   The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=467)   talk space, no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=474)   in the body. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=475)   Now you know that the subconscious mind... 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=476)   I'm quite aware of having that. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=478)   Yeah, the subconscious. 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=479)   Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to know 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=486)   did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, because it's 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=491)   got to be one of those five, that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=501)   reduces the overwhelm. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=503)   So when you're doing that, you're zooming out, for example, and for me I'm less aware, 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=511)   I can tell when I've gone to image space, but I'm not seeing tangible image at this 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=517)   time. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=518)   And I'm aware of talk. 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=519)   That is a sign of subliminal and hence highly significant activity. 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=525)   And I'm aware of that with talk, and with talk I can hear a little more of a rumble, 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=529)   but I still can't. 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=530)   So do I have awareness equally distributed between image and talk? 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=537)   You don't have to actually worry about how to distribute your awareness, because most 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFR5eX0VxmU&t=542)   people discover they know as soon as you give them... 
<br>
