title: "TRACKING WHERE EMOTION COMES FROM   ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=0)   Remind me that I had some other ideas of, well I can actually just tell you. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=13)   Just tell me now and then I can always replay it and go, remember you didn't do it. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=17)   So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well the two flavors have to simultaneously flow and through each other. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=27)   Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal thinking. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=38)   And you might want to look in that direction. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=42)   And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special exercise that, 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=49)   with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but I'll ask you. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=55)   Have we ever done noting feel sources? 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=59)   What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=64)   If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=70)   And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=80)   No, we haven't done that. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=82)   Noted fear, I call that noting feel sources. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=86)   And feel can be generic or specific. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=89)   That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=94)   Because what may be happening is that you're getting significant triggering from other senses that are activating the fear in real time. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=105)   And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=111)   It's a bunch of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=116)   Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=126)   But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=132)   specifically what's triggering what. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=135)   And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=141)   or emotion in general, but especially fear, 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=146)   literally a few minutes of noting what is triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=156)   So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=163)   fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal stuff. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=170)   The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards talk space, 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=177)   no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear in the body. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=183)   Now you know that the subconscious mind... 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=185)   I'm quite aware of having that. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=187)   Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to note, 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=193)   did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=198)   because it's got to be one of those five, 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGQC_ifSIMc&t=201)   that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly reduces the overwhelm.
