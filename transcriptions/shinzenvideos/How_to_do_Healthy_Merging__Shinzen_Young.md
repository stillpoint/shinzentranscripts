<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=0)   If you do a healthy merging with someone, it's not just good for you, it's good for 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=21)   them and they won't feel invaded in any way. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=31)   And that's a skill of being able to do the merging and not make it look like you're invading 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=40)   them somehow. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=41)   You actually have to practice that. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=46)   So when you healthy merge with someone, they shouldn't feel like they're being somehow 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=55)   invaded. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=57)   They should feel like they're being loved unconditionally and everyone wants that. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=66)   Which goes to the equanimity piece. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=70)   The healthy merging is a state of unconditional positive regard towards that person. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=84)   So this is a question that comes up because people get to a certain depth with their practice 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=93)   and they start to experience this merging. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=95)   I had this come up just a few days ago with someone. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=101)   And then they're noticing that people are sort of pulling away from them or something 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=106)   because their focus is too intent. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=111)   And the Chinese have this expression, how can I translate it? 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=129)   Tone down the light and share the dust. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=134)   It means like don't... 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=135)   Share? 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=136)   Share the dust. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=138)   It means don't blow ordinary humans away by looking like you belong to the non-human realm 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=153)   too much. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=157)   It's a skill. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=163)   I know people tell me that you're supposed to share your innermost experience and students 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=172)   love that. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=173)   I don't know if I'd buy that, okay? 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=177)   Because do you really want that much information about your teachers? 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=181)   There is such a thing as TMI. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=186)   So here I'm going to take a chance. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=189)   Now I got your attention. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=196)   Okay this is true, okay? 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=200)   Not a day goes by that sometime bopping around in the world just interacting with people 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=209)   I will have this impish thought. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=214)   I'm passing for one of them. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=220)   They don't know. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=223)   They think I'm a regular North American human. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=228)   And of course most of me is. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=233)   But there's a part that's not human. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=241)   And it's like they don't know. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=245)   They're deceived by the surface. 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=248)   And it's sort of fun. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=249)   Like someone, I don't know, getting away with passing for something that they're not back 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=255)   in the days when there was racism. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=257)   It's like pulling the wool over their eyes. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=261)   Anyway maybe that made no sense at all. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=263)   But you have to pass as a human after you've learned to contact a little bit of what is 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=271)   not human. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=272)   So you have to express that in a way that doesn't weird people out. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=278)   And it takes some training. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=281)   So what characterizes, the reason I laughed when you said why do we merge, okay, is the 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=297)   real question is not why do we merge. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=299)   The real question is why don't we all merge. 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=303)   What happened that got in the way of what was originally there at birth. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=314)   That's all there was. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=316)   We just were. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=319)   We were everything. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=322)   And then I can remember when the self arose within me as a separate. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=327)   I don't have very good memory of childhood, of specific events. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=333)   But boy I absolutely remember when my personhood arose. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=343)   And it was at an early age. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=346)   And it's like, why, something's changed. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=352)   Something's changed. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=354)   I used to just be happy all the time for no reason. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=359)   And now I'm worrying. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=362)   And it was the arising of talk space. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=369)   Before that it's like there weren't any issues. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=371)   It's like why am I not happy anymore? 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=375)   Why am I constantly thinking about the past and the future? 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=381)   I was like, I didn't know what was happening to me and I couldn't stop it. 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=387)   So the question is not why do we merge. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=391)   It's like what happened that prevented us. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=394)   Well what happened was we accumulated enough life experience that we developed a thinking 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=401)   mind. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=403)   Which is good, but it became a prison instantly. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=408)   Which is not so good. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=410)   And then later on in life we're now making the great escape. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=416)   That's what this practice is. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=418)   It's the great escape from that. 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=422)   So anyway to characterize the healthy versus unhealthy merging. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=430)   What characterizes the healthy merging is you understand the mechanism, why it happens. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=440)   You have control over it. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=445)   When you do it, it doesn't weird people out. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=451)   And you carry away just one, two tastes as I mentioned. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=457)   After I've merged I got bigger and I got cleaner and that's it. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=461)   You don't carry away usually anything specific from the merging. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=467)   Unless you decide that you want to do that. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=469)   And as I say in my long career, I mean it was only a couple of years into meditation, 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=476)   maybe a year into practice when I started to get some of that sense of inside and outside 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=481)   merging. 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=482)   That was a long long time ago. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=484)   And in this whole career I've only twice intentionally merged for a purpose. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=488)   And I told you what those two were. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=492)   By the way you folks may get a chance to merge with a mathematician speaking math in front 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=498)   of you that you don't understand. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=502)   Maybe tonight. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=503)   I'm preparing a sacred geometry powerpoint. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=509)   We'll see how that goes. 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=513)   But anyway, so you just carry away an expanded identity and a more elastic identity for having 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=522)   done it. 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=525)   You don't typically carry away something. 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=531)   So that you, it really doesn't make that much difference if you merge with a flower or a 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=539)   garbage can or if you merge with a sinner or a saint. 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=545)   People are like really afraid, I don't want to merge with a psychopath. 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=550)   No you won't pick up any psychopathology. 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=556)   You'll just incorporate that activity. 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=564)   So the unhealthy merging doesn't have those characteristics. 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=578)   You don't understand the mechanism. 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=581)   You carry away something other than empowerment and purification. 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=588)   And in fact typically what you carry away is disempowerment. 
<br>[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=596)   Identification with the aggressor, borderline personality issues, that kind of stuff. 
<br>[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=606)   So healthy separation is the, well I guess there's a psychological form of healthy separation. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=618)   But then there's like making the distinctions that are useful and empowering. 
<br>[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=626)   Meaning see, hear, feel, in, out, rest, flow, sway. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=630)   Those kinds of separating the sensory elements, those are empowering distinctions. 
<br>[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=636)   Those are useful discriminations. 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=641)   Empowering distinction is where a lot of people live, which is that fundamental sense that 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=649)   inside and outside are separated. 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=651)   There's a boundary of my existence that starts with my skin and it's I versus it, which then 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=658)   leads to us versus them. 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=660)   I call that unhealthy separation. 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHbQk1SQCQ&t=664)   So anyway that's what I have to say about that. 
<br>
