<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=0)   I'm Shinzen Yang, and this is? 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=9)   My name is Richard Ford. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=12)   And I'm going to demonstrate how to interactively guide a person in working with the issue of 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=22)   physical discomfort. Richard, would you, or you prefer Rich? 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=27)   Yeah, Rich. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=28)   Rich, would you say something about what you're experiencing now in terms of physical discomfort, 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=35)   pain and so forth? 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=37)   Well, the physical discomfort is in the lower back, both sides, extends down to the hip 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=42)   on the right side. And then occasionally it's shoulder stiffness, and I think it's associated 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=48)   with the back pain in the lower back. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=52)   And is this a condition that's with you, like, most of the time? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=57)   It's been on and off for 20-something years. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=59)   I see. So it's a long-standing condition. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=62)   Yes. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=63)   Is it something that represents a major impediment in your life, or more just sort of an inconvenience? 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=72)   It's an inconvenience, but it has been a major impediment. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=74)   So it sometimes flares and becomes worse, and then other times it's not so severe. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=81)   Okay. What we're going to do is I'm going to just start guiding you, and you can just 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=88)   follow along, and we'll see where it takes us. So I'd like you to start by closing your 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=95)   eyes, and you can sort of lengthen your spine and settle into your posture. Okay, good. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=102)   Now, do you feel pretty settled into the posture? 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=112)   Yes. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=113)   Okay, good. We'll call the areas where you feel the discomfort clearly the primary areas, 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=120)   and I'd like you to focus for a moment on those primary areas, and get a sense of the 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=127)   size, shape, position, and so forth. Able to do that? 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=155)   Yes. 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=156)   And is it one connected area, or is it several disconnected areas that are the primary? 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=164)   Two areas. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=165)   Two independent areas? 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=167)   Yes. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=167)   Okay, good. Now, I'd like you to check out and see if the physical discomfort in your 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=175)   body is limited to those two primaries, or whether the primary areas in some way affect 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=182)   the rest of your body. You can do a sort of conceptual experiment. You can imagine if 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=191)   there was not that primary discomfort, would the rest of your body be in some way more 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=197)   comfortable? If so, then that represents a spread of influence from the primaries. But 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=204)   if that's not the case, then they're truly isolated, and there's no secondary spread. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=212)   Can you make a guess as to whether... 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=215)   It's a spread. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=216)   There's a subtle spread. Does it affect much of your body, most of your body, or the spread 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=224)   is not too wide? 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=227)   Most of it. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=228)   Okay. That is, by the way, excellent spatial resolution. Very often, when a person has 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=236)   a discomfort in their body, most of the suffering will be in the subtle spread. People tend 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=244)   to think it's in the local intensity, and sometimes it can be, but subtle is significant, 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=249)   I often say, and the subtle spread, the fact that you can detect that subtle spread is 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=254)   highly significant. So that's excellent. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=259)   So here's what I'd like you to do. I would like you to work with the, not with the primary 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=266)   initially, but with the subtle spread. We're going to work with the easier material first. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=272)   And I'd like you to let your attention freely float within the secondary sensations, and 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=279)   to just sort of note the part of your body, like knee, face, arms, that kind of thing, 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=286)   where there's secondary discomfort. And because that secondary discomfort is mild relative 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=293)   to the primary discomfort, you may be able to have perfect equanimity with it, just totally 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=300)   accept it. You may not be able to totally accept the primary sensation, but you may 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=305)   be able to totally accept the secondary sensations, because they're milder. Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=310)   Yes, it does. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=311)   So I'm going to have you do that with spoken labels. I'd like you to do that now. 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=323)   Spoken labels. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=324)   In other words, you'll say out loud, knee, face. You'll note, you'll let your awareness 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=330)   freely float within the secondary sensations, go wherever they want, and just say out loud 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=336)   where you're focusing on the secondary. And that will tend to sort of circulate through 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=341)   your body. You'll see your awareness will just sort of naturally go from place to place 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=346)   within the secondary. Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=348)   Yes. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=349)   Good. I'd like you to do that with spoken labels, and I'll just listen in. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=356)   Shoulder blades. Neck muscles. My fingers. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=371)   Good. To make it more impersonal, a matter of fact, you can just make it really simple 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=378)   like shoulder, finger, neck, in a sort of gentle, a matter of fact voice, so you don't 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=385)   have to make it my or like, you make it like really simple and sort of impersonal in a 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=393)   matter of fact. 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=400)   Shoulder blades. Forearms. Thumbs. Neck. Spine. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weE4WO48_UU&t=430)   Lower back. Good.
