title: "Spacing Out & Resistance are Golden Opportunities  ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=0)   Yes? 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=7)   So using that, which is how I mostly meditate, 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=12)   usually between one of the techniques I space out. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=16)   Often that will happen. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=18)   And I'm not in a good place to figure out what to do next, 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=22)   during that space out period, 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=25)   when I realize I've spaced out. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=27)   So what I've been doing is picking something, 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=30)   having something already set in mind that if I find a space out... 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=32)   That's great. That's a clever strategy. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=34)   But also, you know my standard thing, 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=36)   as soon as you get the hint that you're spacing out, 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=41)   if possible, what? 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=43)   What do you do? 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=44)   I'll give you the hint. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=48)   S.L. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=50)   Spoken labels. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=52)   It's not so much a matter of I'm spaced out, 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=54)   oh, I've got to find a new technique. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=57)   It's I'm spaced out, 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=59)   I've got to use my options with this technique. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=62)   So let's continue on this, because I know that, 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=65)   and that often comes to mind, 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=67)   and I don't want to. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=70)   I wish I felt stronger to work with that, 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=74)   so usually I'll just go back to that beginning technique. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=77)   Okay. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=78)   So let me put a positive spin on I don't want to. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=82)   That's my job, basically, 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=86)   is to show that actually everything is a window of opportunity. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=90)   The I don't want to. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=95)   What's positive about the I just don't want to? 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=101)   Resistant thing. Okay. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=103)   Well, you're spacing out, right? 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=106)   It means that the concentration isn't good. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=109)   It means that the attention is being scattered, 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=112)   and we want to gradually train ourselves 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=115)   so that our attention isn't scattered. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=119)   But what's difficult is that what's scattering attention is not tangible. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=125)   There's an intangible force that is scattering your attention, 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=130)   and you're at the mercy of it as long as it's intangible. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=134)   Now, here's why the I just don't want to use spoken labels 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=140)   is a window of opportunity, 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=143)   because if you do speak the labels, 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=148)   you're going to not feel good in subjective space. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=153)   The speaking of the labels is going to be uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=157)   That's why you don't want to do it, 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=159)   and forcing yourself to do it will make you uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=165)   Why is that good? 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=167)   Because the invisible forces that were controlling you 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=171)   now have come up as tangible sensations in the body that are penetratable. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=179)   Okay? 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=180)   And so you go to focus in or focus on feel, feel in, 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=186)   and you force yourself to do the spoken labels, 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=189)   and you apply it to how uncomfortable you are speaking the labels. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=195)   And that then allows you to work through those forces in a tangible way. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=201)   So I wasn't being facetious or cavalier when I said that actually 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=207)   it is actually a window of opportunity to work through the driving forces of scatteredness. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=214)   So if you're willing to do it, 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=216)   you're going to really develop concentration power effectively. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=220)   If you're not willing to do it, it's petty-wise and powerful. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=223)   You feel a little better during the set, 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=226)   but you're not really deeply training the skills. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=230)   So that's my little motivational spiel for SL, spoken labels. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=236)   Yes? 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=237)   Well, just to piggyback on that, 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=240)   this morning I spent the first and second SID. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=245)   I was really tired from that morning. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=247)   And so I used labels that were mouth. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=252)   Yeah, you used sotto voce. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=254)   That is not nearly as difficult for me anyway to do as spoken labels, 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=259)   and it was completely effective. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=261)   It was really good. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=262)   You whispered the words. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=264)   Not even whispered. 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=265)   You sub-vocalized. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=266)   You just moved your lips. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=267)   Just lips. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=268)   And so there's that, but also I have to tell you, 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=271)   I looked through the manual, 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=272)   and you don't have any place where you describe 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=275)   the three different ways of labeling, 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=277)   the four different ways of labeling. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=279)   That's in the next edition. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=281)   That is the biggest lacuna in there, 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=285)   which I realized in my horror soon after we brought out this. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=289)   What's wrong with this picture? 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=291)   The central technique is not fully described. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=294)   Now, there is the how to note it label on the paper, 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=303)   but we forgot to put it into the manual. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=306)   So, yeah, it's like the thousand pound elephant in the room. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=309)   So I am poignantly aware of that. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=315)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=318)   Yes. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=319)   This thing you were describing about the self-resistance 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=324)   and you stop undying, 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=326)   I'm not sure you understood what you're doing. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=330)   You're stopping undying in the character. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=333)   Well, what happens is, yes, I went through it fast, so thanks for asking. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=340)   So we sometimes are aware of just that there are like forces driving us, 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=347)   in our behaviors, driving us to think, driving us to talk, driving us to move. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=353)   And it's like force. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=355)   It's just a force that's making me do it. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=357)   And it's intangible in the sense that I can't locate it in time and space 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=363)   or give any quality to it other than say it's a force. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=367)   Follow what I'm saying? 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=369)   Nothing mysterious so far, right? 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=372)   Okay, so how can we make these invisible, intractable forces tangible and tractable 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=381)   so that we can actually penetrate them and work them through? 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=385)   Well, they have to come up to, percolate up to tangibility. 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=389)   The way they percolate up to tangibility is through abstinence. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=393)   Okay? 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=394)   If you abstain from X, then what's been driving you to do X is going to come to the surface. 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=400)   It's going to come to the surface as image, talk, emotional body, sometimes physical body too. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=406)   This is true for any addiction recovery situation, whether it's recovery from a substance 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=412)   or recovery from compulsive thinking or recovery from life. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=421)   The ultimate recovery program. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=424)   Break the addiction to life and death. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=428)   It's called liberation. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=430)   But the same is true, okay? 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=432)   The same principle holds. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=434)   You have to abstain in order for what's been driving it to come up and be tangible as image, talk, body. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=444)   Okay? 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=446)   So when that happens, now you can apply a technique. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=449)   So the situation that Pam was describing is, well, I space out. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=455)   And that's a habit. 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=458)   I space out. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=460)   And I know that I should go to the spoken labels, but I don't want to do it. 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=466)   So that's another habit. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=468)   Not wanting to do the spoken labels. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=470)   So what I said is, well, let me put a positive spin on that situation. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=475)   If you force yourself, if you abstain from not speaking the labels, okay? 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=481)   So in this case, it's a do the behavior thing. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=484)   If you do that behavior, you're going to feel uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=487)   Well, we don't want to feel uncomfortable in general, but actually in this case we do. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=492)   Because whatever comes up in image, talk, and emotional body of I hate this, or, you know, you get bang here, bang here, bang here. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=500)   That represents the forces that were driving those behaviors. 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=505)   But now those forces are not invisible forces. 
<br>[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=508)   They're tangible sensations. 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=511)   They're tangible visual, auditory, and somatic experiences. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=515)   Well, what is tangible can be quantumized and can be experienced completely, can be penetrated. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=522)   Therefore, what is tangible is trackable, meaning that we can apply a mindfulness technique to it. 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=538)   Things are intangible, they're not trackable, okay? 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=542)   So there's little we can do other than white knuckle. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=546)   But what is tangible is trackable, meaning you can note it. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=555)   What is trackable is tractable, means you can get a handle on it. 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=561)   So that's the mechanism that I was describing with regards to why you, what's going to happen if you force yourself to speak the labels and why that's a good thing kind of thing. 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=574)   So that's the same as stopping at a dime? 
<br>[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=577)   It's very related. 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=578)   Because when you stop on a dime in daily life, then the juices that have been stirred up by life come up with a vengeance very quickly. 
<br>[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=592)   And if you can be Johnny on the spot with it, you can actually meditate retroactively. 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=602)   You say, well, I thought that's against the rules. You can't do that. 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=607)   Let's say that you're bopping around in the world and you're just like a whirling dervish and you're going here, going there. 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=615)   No techniques, no awareness. 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=617)   And I'm going to really face what's been stirred up. In that ten minutes, if you really bring your A game, you can retroactively process all those hours of unconscious freneticness. 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=644)   And that's the rhythm of the Zen day. Unlike a vipassana training day, the Zen day is run around like crazy, stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=656)   Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=658)   At least Rinzai Zen. Soto Zen not so much. But Rinzai Zen, absolutely. 
<br>[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=662)   Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. All day. 
<br>[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=668)   Now that's either going to make you just frenetic as hell or you're going to learn what I just said. 
<br>[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=675)   Which is like when you're running around like crazy and then you stop on a dime, you can process all that crazy very, very quickly. 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=685)   So yes, it's related. 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=688)   It sounds like a version of asceticism. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=691)   Well asceticism is a generic term. So there are many facets to asceticism. That could be one of them, yes. 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=705)   Well when I was running my restaurants, I would every hour go out and sit on the bench in front of the restaurant, the bus stop bench, for five minutes. And I found the great advantage of that, stopping like that, is that then at the end of the day you haven't built up a whole lot of samskaras. 
<br>[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=727)   You periodically let go of them so that you're much calmer at the end of the day. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=733)   That's my peppering. 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLOUHAklNvQ&t=736)   That's a great specific example.
