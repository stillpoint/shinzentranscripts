title: "'AUTO WALK' ~ demonstrated by SHINZEN YOUNG"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=0)   So, I like to give people the option of practicing every kind of meditation technique that has 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=16)   ever been developed in the history of world mysticism. And I have this sort of grid where 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=23)   I classify all the techniques, like a periodic table of meditation strategies. So, I try 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=34)   to include in that everything that was a major invention or a major innovation. Some things 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=45)   in meditative technology have only been discovered once, many things have been discovered many 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=51)   times in different cultures. So, one thing that, as far as I know, was only strongly 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=60)   emphasized once is the notion of expressing spontaneity through how you move, how you 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=74)   speak, and the motor part of how you think. This is an aspect of liberation practice that 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=85)   was very much appreciated and developed within the Chan school of Chinese practice. It's 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=96)   particularly associated originally with a master named Mazu, and that eventually evolved 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=102)   into the Linji or Rinzai, as it's called in Japanese school of Zen. So, they put a big 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=114)   emphasis on manifesting impermanence, manifesting emptiness, manifesting non-self in how you 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=124)   move the body, how you sort of channel the words that are coming through your lips, and 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=134)   eventually also learning how to think without thinking. So, there's sort of like, if you 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=142)   do without thinking, there's a just happeningness and it's merged with the dynamic emptiness 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=150)   of nature, yang and yin. If you speak without thinking, same thing. A little trickier is 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=159)   to think without thinking, but it's the same general idea. It turns into thoughts that 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=165)   are spontaneous, creative, wise, and so forth. So, traditionally in Buddhism, they speak 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=176)   of the three karma-dvara, the three gates of action, kaya-vak-citta or kaya-vak-mana, 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=186)   means bodily motions, speech actions, and thought actions. So, I have in my repertoire 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=195)   of techniques a quadrant of training that I call spontaneity training. And I teach people 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=205)   how to access spontaneity in body movement, speech, thought, and even all three at the 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=213)   same time. So, my word, just to have a convenient word for this just happening, empty but rich 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=222)   dynamic quality in motion, to have a word for it, I call it auto from the original Greek 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=229)   meaning spontaneous. Corresponds to certain Asian concepts, the Chinese notion of ziran, 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=238)   which is shizen in Japanese. And there's many words in Tibetan that have this connotation 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=247)   of effortless just happening. Anyway, I call it auto to have a word for it. So, there's 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=254)   a technique of auto-walk or more broadly auto-move, auto-speak, and a specific example of that 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=264)   would be auto-chant, which is relatively easy to do. And then I even have an auto-think 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=269)   technique. So, the way you do auto-move is you just sort of tune into some motion that 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=277)   your body already knows how to do. And you just sort of follow the reflex. You taste 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=284)   the reflexness, the fact that the motor circuits know how to do it without there needing to 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=291)   be much of a thinking ego for it to happen. So, it's like being a little kid. When little 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=298)   kids walk, they just walk for the fun spontaneity or they run for the fun spontaneity or they, 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=305)   you know, like play around in puddles of water or whatever because it's just like, it just 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=312)   happens and they enjoy the just happeningness of it. So, to do the auto-walk, you tune into 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=323)   the fact that your body knows how to walk without needing a you. And it's a little intuitive. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=332)   I can't really describe quite how to do it, but you just sort of get a feel for it with 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=338)   time. In the monastery, the way that people learn about this is by watching other people 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=346)   do it during the work periods or as you're walking from place to place. People do this 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=351)   sort of just walking thing, the more senior monks, and then you sort of pick up on it. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=356)   So, I'm going to show you my particular way of doing the auto-walk. I'm pretty poorly 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=368)   coordinated so it's not going to be very elegant, but there will be a kind of spontaneity to 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=374)   it. So, you just sort of let your legs carry you. You know, I sort of defocus the gaze 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=381)   and it's just sort of happening and it's sort of fun. It's like you're being a little kid 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=388)   again. Now, I add a feature that is not required, which is I engage the visual field. It seems, 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=401)   in addition to this sort of, my legs know how to carry me without me. As I'm moving, 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=408)   it seems like the visual field is expanding in front, but the thing that I just saw an 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=417)   instant ago is collapsing behind me. So, it's like being a bolus being carried in this funnel 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=426)   of expanding light in front and contracting light behind. Then, I combine that with the 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=435)   sort of spontaneity of the movement of the legs and it's like space itself is just sort 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=442)   of carrying me as I'm walking along. I'm exaggerating now. I don't look this silly usually, but 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=450)   you get the general idea. It's just sort of expansion and contraction and the legs are 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=457)   just sort of moving on their own. You could just like play like this for a long time and 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=463)   it's rich because it's dynamic, it's bouncy, but it's empty because there's no one there. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=474)   That was me making Shinzen do auto-walk for everyone on YouTube. Shin heads everywhere. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=483)   And tomorrow, I'm going to get him to do auto-walk while auto-talking, auto-speaking, while auto-thinking. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOB6NQo0Kr8&t=492)   So, stay tuned for more.
