title: "PROS & CONS of DHARMA MAPS  ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=0)   So, the topic was the pros and cons of Dharma maps. Maps that sort of map out, okay, here 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=21)   is the state. I think you were mostly thinking of stages. It's like you go through these 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=27)   stages and this is what happens and then this happens and this happens. So, there are all 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=34)   these maps. So, what's the pros and cons in general of having these maps and what's the 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=42)   pros and cons of this map versus that map kind of thing. I'm assuming that's... 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=47)   The one I like is Mahasi's. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=49)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=50)   The progress of insight. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=51)   And I was afraid of that because that was what I would have gone to the Wikipedia and 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=59)   come all prepared to make comparisons and contrasts, but then again I would have missed 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=67)   my body work. So, maybe I'll have time tomorrow. There's 16 of them, right? 16 stages, I think. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=75)   And I have a vague recollection, but I'm not going to pontificate based on that vague recollection. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=82)   I have a map in my computer. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=85)   Yes. I also have to think about it. Okay, but I can probably say a few things broadly 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=94)   on this issue. Many years ago, the Kuroda Institute, which is an academic Buddhist study 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=104)   institute associated with the Zen Center of LA, had an entire seminar where they invited 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=114)   Buddhist scholars to present papers on stages and maps throughout the Buddhist world. And 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=124)   I tried to find it online. I couldn't. I think it would be really cool if anybody wants to 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=130)   see if that was ever published or is available someplace or other similar scholarly collections 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=141)   where this issue is discussed in its full breadth and depth. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=147)   I would, but I've got body work with Diane. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=150)   Say what? 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=151)   I've got body work with Diane. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=153)   I think you made the right decision. The map is not the journey. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=166)   So you decided to make the journey. So this is good. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=172)   Now, Buddhism broadly is three vehicles. And then within that, there's a gazillion other 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=179)   divisions. It's 2,500 years and half the world and now the whole world. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=189)   And Buddhism is just a subset of world mysticism anyway. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=193)   So broadly, if we're going to talk about maps and that kind of thing, we really should frame 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=201)   Buddhism within the larger context of world contemplative practice. So it's a huge and 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=210)   very rich question that you bring up. So let me just start blabbering and we'll see what 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=218)   comes up. First, I'd like to share my own experience. Well, actually not. Before we 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=224)   do that, so three vehicles, numerous subdivisions, and that's just a subset of what's worldwide. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=233)   So within Buddhism, what do we have? Well, let's see. We have the ten observing pictures. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=240)   That's my most popular YouTube presentation, which tells you that people are really in 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=246)   the stages and what have you. And that's used in Zen. But see, here's the deal. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=253)   There's different versions of the ten. There's one that has eight. So this already tells 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=259)   us that it's not exactly constrained to exactly ten. What else is there? Well, there's the 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=266)   one that I frequently use myself, which is the four classes of noble individuals, the 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=274)   four Aryabhugala. These are maps for a lifetime of practice. This is really big picture stuff. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=286)   Sota, Apana, Sakadagami, Anagami, Araha. So that's stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=295)   and worthy, if I were to translate these into English. Over a lifetime of practice or in 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=303)   traditional belief, over lifetimes of practice, you pass through these four stages. But then 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=311)   there's the stages of insight, which are like 16 stages that precede stream entry, I believe. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=319)   So it's like, oh, it's all this fine subdivision. And then there's the four jhanas, the eight 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=326)   jhanas, the nine jhanas, which are not exactly paths to enlightenment, but they're definitely 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=333)   demarcations and are related. So the Chinese have their ox-herding pictures. The Tibetans 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=345)   have their elephant-herding pictures. And there are various stages. And some of those 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=351)   elephant-herding pictures look an awful lot like some of the versions of the ox-herding 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=356)   pictures. And since, once again, remember that Eastern Tibet and Western China are the 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=363)   same place, so we're not surprised that there would be interactions there, even though the 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=373)   political concerns of those two cultures don't like to, well, they definitely both have axes 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=382)   to grind with regards to history. And that can sort of get in the way. What else is there? 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=389)   Well, there are the ten bodhisattva stages. And then there are Tozan's five degrees, and 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=401)   I'm pretty sure there's a five-stage, one five-stage model that's prominent in the Kargyu 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=410)   lineage. I could be wrong about this. You get the general idea here. There's a lot. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=416)   So now I'll tell you my own story. I started out not as a Buddhist practitioner, but as 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=427)   a Buddhist scholar. And actually, I'm very glad that I had that academic background and 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=433)   that training. And it was serious graduate-level training that involved mastering a half-dozen 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=442)   languages of Asia and reading these things in the original languages, etc., etc. So I'm 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=451)   glad I had that background. But in some ways, well, I remember when I was in the Zen temple 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=459)   in Japan when I started, one of the senior monks there said, because I could really impress 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=469)   them, I mean, I knew classical Chinese and Sanskrit. He said, someday all your learning 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=478)   will be very useful. Someday in the distant future, when you're in a position to teach, 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=485)   it's going to be really, really good that you know all this stuff academically. But 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=491)   right now, it's like totally getting in the way of your practice. And he was totally right. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=502)   So what happened to me was I spent, I would say, at least 15 years, the first 15 years 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=511)   of my practice, torturing myself with regards to where am I at on these maps. Have I experienced 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=523)   this yet? And then it was actually like literally torture. It was like if I read some classic 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=534)   thing, it's like, oh my God, there's a stage I haven't heard of even. What to say of achieved? 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=540)   I never even heard of this one. Well, that's another one to put on the list of I'll never 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=545)   be anywhere until I experience X, Y, and Z. And I mean, it was horrible. It was like for 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=553)   me, because there was so much grasping around the notion of I got to get somewhere and I 
<br>[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=560)   got to get these signs and there's all of these things to do. Well, fortunately, eventually 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=567)   I grew up and grew out of that. But that is one of the dangers of having these maps. Okay, 
<br>[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=576)   we're going to talk about pros and cons. I'm certainly going to talk about pros, but there's 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=581)   certain cons. One of them is that you get very concerned with rating. And of course 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=593)   that just links into the whole thing that when did it start? The sixth grade, kindergarten, 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=603)   certainly by middle school, by high school, it's all about mate and rate, right? So it's 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=610)   status. And so it links into all of that stuff, et cetera, et cetera. The other possible con 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=621)   about these maps is what I was talking about, which I briefly alluded to, which is putting 
<br>[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=635)   an inordinate amount of time and energy and emotional investment in the maps or the quest, 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=644)   the map quest, the quest for the right map. Time and energy that is therefore not devoted 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=653)   to practice. So if you go on the internet, most Buddhist time and energy on the internet 
<br>[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=661)   is being spent in contention about who's got the right map. You don't know whether to laugh 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=670)   or cry because there's people that are interested in making the journey are not interested by 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=682)   and large in debating about who's got the right map by and large because there's only 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=695)   so much time and energy. And the trap is, well, I don't want to start to make the journey 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=701)   until I'm sure that this is the very best, right? Because I don't want to be like not 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=709)   doing the very best. And then what happens is that years pass and people just study and 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=719)   argue and study and argue and study and argue. So what I find useful, although I know to 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=729)   say this is offensive and confusing perhaps, but I myself take great comfort in the notion 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=740)   which I alluded to briefly and has already annoyed people, the notion that actually none 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=749)   of these maps really work very well by my standards of what I would call work very well, 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=759)   meaning that I know enough based on my own personal experience as a professional meditation 
<br>[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=769)   teacher and as a pretty good dilettante scientist, I know enough to know that we can do a lot 
<br>[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=781)   better with regards to making enlightenment available to great masses of people. By we 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=792)   I mean humanity and I mean in the next few centuries. It will take a combination of three 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=804)   things, deep practice, a scientific mentality, and out-of-the-box creativity. But there will 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=817)   be people, probably dozens, maybe hundreds of people in the future that bring these three 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=827)   things together. And it seems to me not unreasonable that they will come up with things that change 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=839)   the course of human history, that dramatically change the course of human history. All of 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=846)   the maps and methodologies that we now have essentially are based on one approach, which 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=856)   is introspection. An individual looks within, discovers certain things, and creates a formulation 
<br>[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=867)   based on that. Often based in part on what they've learned from the past, usually taking 
<br>[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=879)   some parts of that, rebelling against other parts, and often creating something new that 
<br>[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=887)   wasn't there before. Some combination of accepting the past, rebelling against the past, and 
<br>[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=896)   innovation. Then a new model, a new path arises, but it's still based on an individual's introspection. 
<br>[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=907)   And it's pretty good. When I say they're all relatively ineffective, I just mean that it 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=922)   takes a very long time. And most people are not, most human beings are just not willing 
<br>[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=931)   to put the time and energy like you and I are into this path. So what is lacking is 
<br>[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=947)   an objective view of what's going on, a view based on hard science and evidence. What is 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=956)   also lacking is true collaborative dialogue among the masters, and among the masters and 
<br>[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=967)   their students. The great, right now the great masters, most of them are old fashioned, old 
<br>[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=979)   Asians, with whom which you cannot communicate in an open peer to peer kind of dialogue. 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=990)   They won't do it with you as a student, it's just not on their cultural radar. And they 
<br>[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=997)   won't do it among each other either, because there's just too much at stake. So they're 
<br>[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1005)   not like scientists. In science, there could be a Nobel laureate up there, talking about 
<br>[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1015)   something, and I could be a graduate student. And I could get up and I could say you're 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1023)   wrong because of this, this, this and this. And if I'm right, if I've got evidence to 
<br>[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1032)   back it up, then that's it. It's over. Even though I'm just a no one that no one's ever 
<br>[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1046)   heard of, and this guy's got a Nobel Prize, he was wrong. I pointed out something. That 
<br>[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1053)   kind of thing, that doesn't happen in the context of meditation teaching. But I think 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1061)   it will as things become more modern and more Western. You start to have really frank dialoguing 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1071)   among the masters and among the masters and their students. So the combination of turning 
<br>[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1079)   the lens of science towards it, plus really being willing to discuss things, specifically 
<br>[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1090)   to look at each other's maps and discuss in an open way, what's this, what's this. 
<br>[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1098)   No, I don't quite think it works that way, etc. etc. That will probably happen in the 
<br>[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1103)   future. Now, of course, when I say that in general they don't work well based on what 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1112)   I think will eventually replace them in the future, don't get me wrong. Relative to not 
<br>[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1123)   using these maps, relative to not doing this practice, well, forget about that. The alternative 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1131)   to what we now have is horrific. The alternative to not doing it. So, you know, it's good that 
<br>[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1142)   we have this. I just think we can, we meaning humanity, can potentially do a lot better. 
<br>[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1150)   So, okay, so what should we think about, what should we, how should we think about these maps? 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1161)   Well, I pointed out some of the cons. Let's talk about some of the pros. They can give 
<br>[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1170)   you an idea of where to go, what to look for. They can give you an idea of what's optimal 
<br>[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1179)   to do when various things occur. That's really useful. They can motivate you. It's like, 
<br>[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1189)   well, why do it if there's not goodies at the end? Or in the middle? Or even maybe in 
<br>[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1197)   the beginning? So, you can be motivated by this and you can be informed by it so you 
<br>[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1203)   know what to look for. So that's good. They are based, at least in part, on real people's 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1218)   real experience. And those are by and large real people with very, very deep experience. 
<br>[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1226)   So, people with very, very deep experience, that's something we need to pay attention 
<br>[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1238)   to. However, it is also important to realize that not everything that appears in those 
<br>[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1245)   maps is necessarily a deep person's deep experience. Because other factors enter into the creation 
<br>[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1255)   of these things. What are some other factors? Well, some master a thousand years ago might 
<br>[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1269)   have said some things to a student. But they didn't write it down. When that student wrote 
<br>[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1281)   it down, well, that student's ideas are there mixed with that master's ideas. Perhaps there's 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1290)   speculations. So you cannot be sure that you're getting the ipsit-dixit, the very words that 
<br>[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1298)   were said. Furthermore, these things were usually written by hand, not printed. Printing 
<br>[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1307)   is... well, Chinese had printing a long time ago, but they were written by hand, so you 
<br>[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1312)   get scribal error. So if you start to get all fundamentalist about exactly what's there, 
<br>[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1322)   you know, it must be exactly that way. Well, it just might be some scribal error. Also, 
<br>[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1334)   because of the authoritarian nature of these cultures, there's a need to make your innovations 
<br>[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1343)   appear to agree with scripture. So there can be a forcing, where it's like forced onto 
<br>[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1353)   a certain model that has been passed down. All of these, therefore, give us our caveats, 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1363)   not to get fundamentalist about what's literally there. On the other hand, as I said, by and 
<br>[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1373)   large, these are important experiences of deep masters. And so there's really something 
<br>[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1381)   to learn. The Buddha said that there are three epistemological bases. Epistemology means 
<br>[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1396)   the investigation of how we know, how we gain valid knowledge. So in ancient Greece it was 
<br>[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1404)   the same, in ancient India it was the same. There's three bases. Direct experience, logical 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1411)   inference, and reliable authority. Now, the Buddha rejected reliable authority. He said 
<br>[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1423)   base yourself on direct experience and on logical inference. But the fact is, maybe 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1433)   the fact is that consulting with an expert is a good idea. But there's a difference 
<br>[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1444)   between consulting with an expert and reading something that was written, hopefully, by 
<br>[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1454)   an expert a thousand years ago, but may have other things that have entered in there. Because 
<br>[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1462)   when you consult with an authority, you can dialogue. But when you've got a text that 
<br>[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1473)   has come down to you, you can't dialogue with the person that wrote that text. So the 
<br>[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1479)   good news is that there's probably stuff in there that is hugely valuable. The other news 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1486)   is, though, that we can't, we can only, it's a very one-sided communication. It's not like 
<br>[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1496)   when you hire a consultant and you say, you know, this person knows what they're talking 
<br>[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1501)   about, so let's see what their opinion is and then you can ask questions, etc. So those 
<br>[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1512)   are some of the pros and cons of having these maps. I myself don't have a map. I don't 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1534)   say that you'll pass through certain stages and delineate what those stages are. But I 
<br>[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1548)   do give you some general trends. I say that over time you're going to notice an elevation 
<br>[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1556)   in your concentration, clarity and equanimity. And that's going to have some pretty dramatic 
<br>[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1563)   effects on your life. So I like to talk more along those lines. Yet inevitably we want 
<br>[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1576)   to know that we're making progress in some way or another. So I will give you four criteria 
<br>[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1585)   that you can use to judge your progress. Starting with the least, what would I say? Starting 
<br>[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1599)   with, each of these criteria is valid, but there's a hierarchy of maturity. I'm going 
<br>[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1609)   to end with the most mature. So that means I'm going to begin with the least mature, 
<br>[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1615)   but you don't have to take that as a put-down. The least mature criteria is, during periods 
<br>[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1623)   of practice I have experiences that are unusual, interesting, fun, entertaining, and so forth. 
<br>[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1632)   An awful lot of people, for an awful lot of people that is the criteria. If you want to 
<br>[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1641)   sell spirituality, you sell entertainment. But I'm not saying that that's completely 
<br>[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1651)   without validity. Because if fun and interesting and unusual things happen, then that's going 
<br>[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1660)   to motivate you to keep practicing. So from that perspective, that's fine. The only problem 
<br>[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1667)   is, I don't care who you are or who your teacher is or what you're doing, it ain't going to 
<br>[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1675)   always be fun and interesting and entertaining and have unusual things happen. So then when 
<br>[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1686)   it's the opposite of all those, if you hold out these criteria of fun, interesting, unusual, 
<br>[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1695)   entertaining, then when the opposite of those happen for a period of time, which could be 
<br>[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1702)   perhaps a long period of time, then it's to hell with meditation. You don't want to do 
<br>[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1710)   it anymore. So, that's one criteria, because have fun if you can. A little bit more mature 
<br>[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1720)   is during a formal period of practice, you can actually taste mindfulness. You can taste 
<br>[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1728)   concentration, clarity, and equanimity right while you're doing the practice. And each 
<br>[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1735)   one of them has its own taste, its distinctive reward taste. And it's a mature palate. You 
<br>[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1743)   learn how to taste that. There's just a taste of being concentrated. And as Mike Chixentli 
<br>[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1752)   Hai pointed out, that's an intrinsic reward just to being concentrated. Doesn't matter 
<br>[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1761)   what you're concentrated on, independent of the particular focus. Hence, you could be 
<br>[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1770)   doing a god awful boring task, like licking stamps or the archetypal nun task is stepping 
<br>[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1785)   out communion wafers, okay? You know, like hours and hours every day just making these 
<br>[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1792)   communion wafers. Okay, now, I would suggest to you that that is either heaven or hell, 
<br>[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1798)   depending on how recollected you are. Recollected is the Catholic word for Samadhi. So, if you're 
<br>[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1807)   tasting, like Shelley, some of you know Shelley Young. So, before she became a really impressive 
<br>[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1819)   psychotherapist back when we were kids, she used to do temp jobs. And it was literally 
<br>[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1828)   like licking envelopes, right? Putting stamps on it, whatever. So, she'd go to these temp 
<br>[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1833)   jobs and there would be other temp workers doing this. And as the day progressed, you 
<br>[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1844)   could see their moods deteriorate, okay? They were just like, by the end of the day, they 
<br>[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1850)   were just like, you know, not doing a very good thing. But she would just get higher 
<br>[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1856)   and higher and higher, right? Because it was Samud, it was Karma Yoga, it was a tasted 
<br>[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1866)   concentration, Samadhi, the rest of it, the taste of Samadhi was there all day. So, I 
<br>[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1872)   mean, she left and she was just like, you know, she's doing this shit job, pardon my 
<br>[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1878)   French. But the more shit job it is, the actually easier it is to meditate, in that sense, right? 
<br>[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1885)   The simpler. So, you know, with that taste of concentration. So, and the clarity has 
<br>[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1894)   its own taste and the equanimity is the taste of release and catharsis of purification. 
<br>[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1900)   So, yes, if you can actually taste those things while you're doing formal practice, then, 
<br>[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1908)   yeah, that's good, that's a sign of progress. But what about when you can't taste those 
<br>[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1916)   things? Because that's going to happen. Why? You can go for years with very deep states 
<br>[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1923)   of mindfulness, but then either something happens in the external world that's pretty 
<br>[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1931)   challenging or nothing's happening in the external world, but it's just time for the 
<br>[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1938)   next layer of stored material to release. And suddenly it seems as though you're back 
<br>[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1945)   to square one. You can't focus, it's just like everything is surface, it's like I never 
<br>[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1951)   meditated before. Now, you're not really back to square one, the clock is not pointing to 
<br>[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1959)   where you started, okay? Many days have passed, okay? It's not the same day, even though it 
<br>[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1966)   seems like the clock is still pointing to, you know, twelve o'clock or what have you. 
<br>[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1971)   But it seems that way. So, you're not going to have those reward flavors. So, then what? 
<br>[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1978)   Well, if that's all that you use to judge your practice with, then you're not going 
<br>[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1983)   to be meditating. So, what's the next mature, more mature criterion is not now linked to 
<br>[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=1994)   what I experienced during formal practice. It's linked to the long-term effects of the 
<br>[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2000)   practice in daily life. It's possible you might not have anything unusual or entertaining 
<br>[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2007)   during the practice. It's possible that you might not even taste concentration, clarity 
<br>[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2018)   or equanimity individually or collectively. But you notice there's a trend in daily life 
<br>[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2026)   as you're sort of popping around in the world with regards to five things. One or a combination 
<br>[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2038)   of the following five. Less suffering, more fulfillment, insights, understandings about 
<br>[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2051)   things that sort of happen, either personal or transpersonal, improvements in your behavior 
<br>[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2061)   and a kind of sense of love and service for humanity, a disappearing of that fundamental 
<br>[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2074)   alienation that separates inside and outside. And along with that, a sense of a larger identity 
<br>[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2084)   that it is your privilege to serve. If in one or a combination of these, it can just 
<br>[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2094)   be one, often it's reduced suffering. It's not necessarily the whole list. But if in 
<br>[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2100)   any of these areas you're noticing improvements and it seems to be linked to the practice, 
<br>[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2107)   then we say that you're making progress and the practice is working. 
<br>[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2119)   The most mature criteria is to just do the practice and not really, you just do the practice, 
<br>[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2130)   you do the practice and you're not really thinking that much about the goals. As Maezumi 
<br>[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2138)   once said, when asked directly, what is satori? What is enlightenment? He said, 
<br>[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2145)   satori to satori de nai to no kubetsu ga naku naru koto deshou. I think you could say that 
<br>[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2154)   satori, enlightenment, is the passing away of the distinction between enlightenment 
<br>[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2161)   and non-enlightenment, which is a very empowering statement in a lot of different ways. 
<br>[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2173)   So you might say that how far away are you from enlightenment would be measured in exactly 
<br>[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2188)   how much you identify with the moment by moment arising of the conviction, I'm not enlightened 
<br>[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2200)   and I won't be. So the length of time between where you're at now and enlightenment is no 
<br>[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2210)   longer than the length of that thought, I'm not enlightened, depending on your relationship 
<br>[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2217)   to that thought each time it comes up. So, very fast path to enlightenment, have a complete 
<br>[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2229)   experience of the belief that you're not enlightened. Now you understand a complete experience, 
<br>[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2236)   I described a complete experience. Complete experience is a paradoxical experience. It's 
<br>[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2243)   infinitely full and absolutely vacuous at the same time. Okay, so, here's a, let's see, 
<br>[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2263)   I wrote down, I did actually write down a couple of things. Okay. What does that say? 
<br>[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2279)   Okay. It's in Chinese. Okay, so here are some common beliefs about the maps that people 
<br>[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2298)   have and that don't agree with my experience. I just say it that way. One very common belief 
<br>[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2313)   is that there's this thing called enlightenment and before it happens to you, you're messed 
<br>[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2322)   up and after it happens to you, everything is perfect. Now, you know, when we say it 
<br>[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2332)   that way, we sort of like laugh and well, no one's that naive, but actually this notion 
<br>[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2339)   is deep down in people, okay, because I see it. It's like, even though we say that like, 
<br>[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2351)   even if we use the Theravada model, okay, and we say enlightenment is stream entry, 
<br>[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2356)   what is, well, there's like three more steps, right? And although it may seem from pututjana 
<br>[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2366)   to ariya, to a street, to a sotapanna. Pututjana means you're not there yet, okay, means, literally 
<br>[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2376)   means an ordinary person, okay, pututjana. So from pututjana to sotapanna seems very 
<br>[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2384)   far, I know, but sotapanna to araha, that distance, that's really far, okay. Stream 
<br>[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2399)   enters all over the place, all over the place. Arahas, I mean, I've met a few that probably 
<br>[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2412)   were or could have been if they wanted to be, Sasaki Roshi could be if he wanted to 
<br>[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2418)   be, I'm not sure he wants to be an araha. Well, you say, well, wait, that doesn't make 
<br>[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2424)   any sense. But when you're that enlightened, the difference between enlightenment and non-enlightenment 
<br>[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2430)   goes away, okay. So we can't really fathom the decisions of people like that. You look 
<br>[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2438)   at the classical path and you see the descriptions of what arahas are supposed to be like, well, 
<br>[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2445)   Sasaki Roshi's not that way, okay, but you sense he could be that way if he wanted to. 
<br>[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2451)   He just doesn't want to sever the connection to humanity. That's called the bodhisattva. 
<br>[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2458)   I mean, the ones that I've met from Southeast Asia, like Thamphu Luseda, you can find him 
<br>[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2464)   on the internet, okay. You can actually get videos of the Thamphu Luseda. He was a reputed 
<br>[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2471)   araha. 20, 30 years ago, how long ago, I don't remember. Remember, some of you can remember 
<br>[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2481)   when I was downtown at CMC in Koreatown, at my own center there. Yeah, Charlie, Judy, 
<br>[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2487)   go back that far. You remember? Yeah, you do remember. I remember picking you guys up 
<br>[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2493)   at the station downtown. 
<br>[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2496)   I remember learning to meditate with that ice cream truck, too. 
<br>[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2501)   Oh, yeah. The ice cream truck and the schizophrenic derelicts and the mariachi on one side and 
<br>[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2508)   the Sino-Vietnamese opera on the other side. To say nothing of the gunshots and the turf 
<br>[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2517)   wars of the drug dealers fighting on the front lawn. We're killing you, Araha! And we're 
<br>[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2524)   actually there meditating. Yeah, that was, that's the center I used to have. It was like 
<br>[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2534)   amazing. New Year's? Ah! New Year's in El Barrio. It's the Battle of the Bulge. Guns 
<br>[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2546)   everywhere. I mean, automatic weapons. So, you know this thing of sitting, sitting until 
<br>[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2554)   midnight? It's so tame now. You know, it's really like very anti-climactic for me. Like, 
<br>[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2564)   last night, was it last night? The night before, whatever. You know, hit the bell here, I heard 
<br>[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2572)   maybe a firework somewhere. You don't even hear people go, ah! You know, because we're 
<br>[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2578)   just too far away from things. But when we were down at the community meditation center 
<br>[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2584)   downtown, we did the thing. I've been doing the sit, you know, the chant, the om mani 
<br>[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2590)   padme, and then we ring the bell exactly at midnight. I've been doing that for like 40 
<br>[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2595)   years or something. Well, down there, it would start like maybe a minute before you know 
<br>[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2606)   the bell was going to ring because, okay, because the gunshots would start. And then 
<br>[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2612)   it would just reach this crescendo. It would end on all sides. And you could actually see 
<br>[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2618)   the tracer bullets going out, okay, out the window. I think it's illegal now, right? 
<br>[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2626)   To shoot off guns. I thought it was illegal then. And so then you hit the bell, right? 
<br>[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2634)   And then there would just be this firestorm of rounds going off in all directions. But 
<br>[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2643)   anyway, back in those days, which had their charm, but I'm sure glad we grew out of that. 
<br>[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2654)   But back in those days, when I give classes, there would be four or five people. It was 
<br>[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2664)   a pretty small operation. So one of my residents, just before, I used to do this thing on Monday 
<br>[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2672)   where people would come. So one of my residents calls me up and he says, 
<br>[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2684)   Taunpulu Sayadaw. Sayadaw is like the Burmese equivalent of Roshi, okay? Taunpulu, T-A-U-N-G-P-U-L-U. 
<br>[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2694)   Taunpulu Sayadaw is in town. He's at the Burmese temple. And he says he's willing to come over 
<br>[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2703)   and talk to your group tonight. You know, this is like that joke about Jesus shows up 
<br>[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2709)   in the parish church. I mean, it's like, oh my God, okay? Because this guy was a reputed 
<br>[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2718)   arhat. He was old. He had not gone horizontal for 30 years. Every night, yaza, for the last 
<br>[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2728)   three decades. Okay. They carried him around in a palanquin kind of thing. And he came. 
<br>[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2741)   He came to my little center in Koreatown. He didn't speak any English. He had translators. 
<br>[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2748)   And he did not look like any human being that I ever saw. I mean, in terms of his body language 
<br>[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2758)   or whatever. Like I say, look him up on the internet, okay? It's like death walking. 
<br>[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2766)   It's like dead man walking, okay? It was like, imagine a human made out of rubber that you 
<br>[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2778)   could just like pull on any part of the anatomy and it would just like stretch. There's just 
<br>[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2783)   nothing there to resist. Okay. So yeah, this guy was probably an arhat, okay? But you know, 
<br>[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2797)   hey, I can do one yaza. But like eternal yaza? That's a whole other deal. Okay. So anyway. 
<br>[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2821)   So first of all, what I call enlightenment is stream entry. And that's doable by you folks. 
<br>[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2829)   I mean, that's like, you know, that's the stated goal of my program. So, you know, you 
<br>[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2839)   think that people have this idea, oh, I'm going to get enlightenment and then everything's 
<br>[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2844)   going to be okay. Well, the distance between having seen no self for good and full purification 
<br>[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2857)   of consciousness, that is a huge distance. But no matter how much you tell people that, 
<br>[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2865)   you get these weird things that they expect senior masters to somehow be perfect, okay? 
<br>[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2873)   Or people that are enlightened at a stream entrance level, then people get all weirded 
<br>[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2880)   out when they're screwed up in certain ways. Even though we say, you know, hey, working 
<br>[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2888)   this whole thing out, it takes a lifetime, okay? Enlightenment in the sense of stream 
<br>[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2895)   entry is just the beginning. But however many times you say that, people that are enlightened 
<br>[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2902)   at some level, when they screw up, people seem to be surprised for some reason. It's 
<br>[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2907)   like, well, they're enlightened, how could they do this and do that? Enlightenment just 
<br>[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2911)   means that you've seen no self for good forever. But it doesn't mean you've worked out all 
<br>[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2919)   your bad habits by any means. That's what those three other stages are. So this notion 
<br>[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2927)   either expressed or implied or somewhere in the subconscious that because someone has 
<br>[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2934)   a deep practice, even a practice so deep that they have abided permanent oneness and nothingness, 
<br>[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2944)   the notion that, oh, well, everything's perfect and they never suffer about anything and they 
<br>[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2951)   never make mistakes, it doesn't work that way. And besides, even if you become an arhat, 
<br>[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2962)   that's great, but that's not a Buddha. What's the difference between a Buddha and an arhat? 
<br>[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2972)   The Buddhist tradition has asked that question, okay? The Buddha is a special kind of arhat. 
<br>[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2979)   So what's different about the Buddha if an arhat is fully enlightened, has impeccable 
<br>[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=2985)   behavior and never suffers? So then what's the difference between that and a Buddha? 
<br>[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3002)   The Buddhist scholastic tradition says, and I think it's a very good answer, the difference 
<br>[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3008)   is that a Buddha is a creative arhat. A Buddha comes up with something that no one discovered 
<br>[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3016)   before, number one. And number two, it is of sufficient power and relevance that it 
<br>[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3026)   changes human history. So from that perspective, there's only been one Buddha so far that we 
<br>[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3035)   know of historically, 2,500 years ago, that has had that big an impact on the world being 
<br>[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3042)   enlightened. But I think we're due for the next one, okay? But the next one may not be 
<br>[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3048)   a person, maybe a team of enlightened, scientifically oriented, out-of-the-box thinkers, maybe a 
<br>[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3059)   different one, with the technology as it will exist. Okay, so, this notion of... So I can 
<br>[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3074)   see why some teachers avoid the e-word, because people have this idea that it's like, oh, 
<br>[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3080)   you're screwed up, then you're enlightened, and everything's perfect. The other notion 
<br>[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3086)   that people seem to have is that enlightenment happens suddenly. It can. But in my experience, 
<br>[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3101)   not necessarily. I see that in a lot of cases, it just sort of comes on, okay? And you're 
<br>[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3112)   acclimatized to it, you may not really quite realize that you actually have become enlightened, 
<br>[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3118)   because it wasn't sudden and dramatic. So, there's that point. Can it happen suddenly 
<br>[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3135)   and dramatically? Sure. But I don't particularly aim at that. However, some teachers do. They 
<br>[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3145)   aim at getting you to have this sudden epiphany kind of thing. And if they have a track record 
<br>[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3153)   in producing those results, then that's a good teacher, okay? When I look at teachers, 
<br>[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3160)   I don't look at, say, oh, this one has this map that I agree with, and this one has this 
<br>[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3166)   other map that I don't agree with, but this person says it's similar to what I say, so, 
<br>[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3172)   you know, they're right, or something. I don't think that way about teachers. I think about 
<br>[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3179)   track record. Someone could have a completely different perspective than I do. But if they've 
<br>[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3189)   got a track record in leading people to significant transformation, I'd rather have you study 
<br>[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3198)   with that person than someone that, like, agrees with my methodology but doesn't have 
<br>[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3205)   a track record. So, anyway, be that as it may. Another thing that notion that people 
<br>[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3221)   seem to have is, not fairly recently, is that everyone has to go through these dark night 
<br>[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3230)   experiences before they get enlightened. Dark night experiences are sort of emptiness and 
<br>[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3239)   no self and it's a bad trip kind of thing. Fear and depression and hopelessness and disorientation, 
<br>[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3249)   etc., etc. And it's horrible and you just have to white knuckle through it. That everyone 
<br>[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3259)   has to go through these. That's not been my experience at all. Now, everyone has to go 
<br>[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3267)   through some fear and some depression and some disorientation, but not necessarily this 
<br>[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3275)   sort of paralytic thing that can last for months or years that some people do go through. 
<br>[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3283)   Don't worry, you probably won't. One last thing is the notion that the map is linear. 
<br>[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3295)   That there's this step and this step and this step and this step. Because when you act... 
<br>[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3302)   That doesn't agree with my experience. When you actually talk to people that use that 
<br>[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3309)   and you say, well, is it like literally that or do you revisit certain steps and does it 
<br>[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3316)   loop around, etc., etc., they'll say, oh, well, yeah, actually you do go through these 
<br>[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3323)   things cyclically over and over again, which does agree with my experience. But the way 
<br>[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3331)   it's presented, it's not presented that way. It's presented like there's just this linear 
<br>[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3337)   progression. So that's why I don't have a linear map. What do I have? I have a looping 
<br>[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3345)   and branching algorithm. And I think that a lot of the linear maps, when you really 
<br>[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3354)   ask what really happens, are looping and branching algorithms. So that impression, I can promise 
<br>[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3364)   you that topologically, a series of points with links is not at all the same as a net. 
<br>[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3381)   Those are mathematically completely different critters. A sequence with arrows that only 
<br>[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3393)   point in one direction is not at all even remotely like a directed cyclic graph. So 
<br>[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3407)   if it's really a looping and branching algorithm, then we shouldn't be calling it a linear map. 
<br>[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3418)   So I set the thing up so that you do certain procedures and certain things happen. Some 
<br>[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3427)   of the things that happen will be walls. You'll hit the wall, there'll be a challenge. And 
<br>[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3432)   then there's something optimal to do for that challenge. Some of the things that happen 
<br>[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3438)   will be windows. There'll be windows of opportunity. And there's something optimal to do. And the 
<br>[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3444)   whole thing is just loops and branches and loops and branches, optimizing your experience 
<br>[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3450)   as the months and years go on. And that's sort of the view that I like to take. 
<br>[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3457)   Now, having said that, I don't have a map, etc., etc. I have to be honest, it is also 
<br>[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3468)   true that there are certain broad trends. But it's not like everyone goes through these 
<br>[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3480)   trends. There is a trend over time for the themes of flow and impermanence and so forth 
<br>[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3496)   to become prominent in your practice. But that doesn't mean that if that's not the case, 
<br>[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3504)   that your practice isn't working. But I openly talk about flow and so forth because I think 
<br>[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3516)   it's useful to know about it and to work with it and so forth. So, yes, there is a tendency 
<br>[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3527)   as time goes on for many people for that to become more and more prominent part of your 
<br>[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3535)   meditation landscape. But as I say, that's not necessarily the case for everyone. So 
<br>[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3547)   how will you know if you're making progress? Well, I give you four ways of judging if you're 
<br>[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3554)   making progress. It is also practically useful to touch base with at least one competent 
<br>[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3568)   coach at least every once in a while to talk about your practice, to dialogue, to see, 
<br>[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3575)   okay, what's working, what may not be working, get suggestions and so forth. So I think that's 
<br>[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3585)   all that came to my mind tonight in talking about maps. Is that okay? It's something. 
<br>[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3597)   I think in the future when the kind of really open dialogue that I envisage takes place 
<br>[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3608)   and when evidence, objective evidence, all of the scientific method is brought into this 
<br>[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3619)   whole thing that I would make a conjecture that maybe in a hundred years or two hundred 
<br>[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3628)   years there will only be one universal model. But it will probably be a very complex model 
<br>[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3639)   because it would have to cover all the individual variations of individual human beings. But 
<br>[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3650)   I suspect that we'll someday have a true science of enlightenment. And I can't say for sure, 
<br>[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3659)   right, but it's what my gut tells me. We'll either survive or we won't. And if we do survive, 
<br>[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIgTY-8M5A&t=3667)   I think the future will be very bright. It's our honor and privilege to be the early adopters.
