<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=0)   Shenzhen gives an example when he started doing music meditation. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=19)   He gave an example, he refers people to your iPod a lot. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=23)   Would you just explain a little bit about what's happening on your iPod 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=27)   and why Shenzhen is referring them to you? 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=31)   Sure. Music is very, very important in my life. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=36)   When my house is empty, I fill it with music. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=41)   Not always, but when you have a household of people and they leave, 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=45)   it's like, I can listen to my own music now. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=48)   So I found, I love classical music, and when he teaches the music meditation, 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=54)   he will use a technique of vanishing or gone. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=58)   He uses the rest, and he uses the active states. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=62)   I don't know if we're still using that term, but active states. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=66)   So what I did is I went through my classical music and I categorized it. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=70)   Things that had, for instance, the gone, you know, there's moments when there's no sound. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=77)   And so then you can note the gone. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=79)   So I have about four or five pieces on my iPod that I've labeled meditation, music, gone. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=86)   And then I have four or five pieces that are rest states, and four or five pieces for pure sound. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=93)   Now, somebody else might not find those pure sound, 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=96)   but to me, they fill me so that I can just be the sound. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=102)   And I've actually loaned my iPod to many people, and they've taken them off. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=106)   So I especially use it when I'm flying. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=111)   I was just going to say, how are you using it primarily? 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=114)   When I'm flying, when I want to relax, when I want pure sound and just be the music, 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPqq3CqAKvI&t=122)   to take myself out of the marketplace, that's when I use it.
