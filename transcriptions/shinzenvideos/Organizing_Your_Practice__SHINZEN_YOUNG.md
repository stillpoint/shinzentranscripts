title: "Organizing Your Practice ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=0)   I had you do the theme blast yesterday, right? 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=7)   But it was scheduled to be the modality blast. 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=10)   Is that right? 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=12)   We were pissed. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=14)   So we're going to amend the schedule so that we don't get a chance for the modality blast. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=23)   We want a refund. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=25)   I'm a paid guy. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=40)   Wait till you hear my fee schedule. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=47)   TS Eliot, you know, costing nothing less than everything, and I'll show you well. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=57)   Okay, so today I wanted to talk about organizing your practice. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=65)   So it's a little bit of a lecture thing to start with. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=68)   Particularly, there are a number of you that are first timers that will be leaving today. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=75)   So I wanted to get this conceptual piece clear. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=81)   So the way I think about organizing one's practice, symbolically I think of two cycles. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=93)   Delta cycle and maybe an epsilon cycle or a y cycle. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=101)   So this is day to day and this is year to year. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=107)   You can imagine that these are actually cycles that are going around. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=115)   If you can establish these cycles, you have a very high probability of success with your practice. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=126)   So the day to day cycle is each day try to do some formal practice. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=132)   And the bottom of this pyramid stands for formal practice. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=141)   Here's how I define, I'm going to be very precise in my definitions. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=147)   So here's how I define formal practice. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=150)   Formal practice means that you have a set technique or a set sequence of techniques and you implement that. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=159)   And that's where the majority of your resources are going to maintain that technique or sequence of techniques for a period of time. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=173)   That's formal practice. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=175)   By way of contrast, this top of the pyramid here, that stands for what I call practice in life. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=184)   Often people will do a period of formal practice in the morning. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=189)   Some people do morning and evening. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=193)   It's good if you can do formal practice most days and it's good if you can do it at the same time, same place, if that's possible. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=204)   But if that's not possible, if it has to be a different time, a different place, okay. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=209)   If it's not most days, that's okay. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=212)   But ideal, the standard that most people do is in the morning because that sets up the whole day to be optimal for practice in life, which we'll describe in a moment. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=231)   So, in order to be able to speak with precision about the elements of one's practice, so we'll use this defined terminology. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=241)   Formal practice, for example, if you were doing a noting technique that involved mental labeling, during a period of formal practice there would be unbroken labeling and you'd be implementing that technique. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=256)   Now, there's two ways to do formal practice. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=259)   Practice in stillness, where the body is essentially not moving, or not moving much, seated, standing, lying down, that kind of thing. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=268)   And practice in motion, where the body is moving. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=272)   And so I distinguish, when I say practice in motion, it means formal practice, as opposed to practice in life, okay, which we'll talk about in a moment. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=285)   So, this is how I use the terms. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=288)   I encourage people to definitely do formal practice each day, if possible, or most days. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=294)   If possible, include both some practice in stillness and some practice in motion, or at least occasionally have formal practice in motion. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=305)   Why? Because we want to have, that will make it easier to have carryover into practice in life. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=312)   So, what is practice in life? 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=314)   What we're doing right now is an example of practice in life. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=318)   Some of you are listening to the content of what I'm saying and allocating resources that way, but probably some of you, every once in a while, are going back into a technique, 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=329)   maybe for a few seconds here, or a minute there, and then you're sort of like coming back. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=335)   Or maybe some of you are mostly just doing a technique now, okay. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=340)   You're just patiently listening because they've heard it a million times. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=344)   You know exactly what it's going to say, but don't be sure, I might surprise you. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=350)   So, you're going in and out of formal technique, or of technique. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=355)   That's practice in life. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=357)   So, we'll talk about what techniques in a moment, but first we're going to talk about these cyclic rhythms. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=367)   So, I would encourage you at least, if you're committed to this practice, which I'm pretty sure everyone in this room is pretty committed to this practice, 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=379)   try to do at least a half-dozen times a day, have a little micro-hit where you go into a technique, 30 seconds here, 3 minutes there, you're waiting in line, 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=390)   you're walking to the washroom, you're having a vacuous conversation with a co-worker, you're at a meeting, 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=398)   where you don't have to be engaged, but you want to look like you're engaged, but see out, you're out. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=407)   Gone is really useful. 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=414)   So, you're implementing a technique, but then it's like they call your name at the meeting, 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=420)   okay, now I'm back to business, that kind of thing. 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=423)   So, it's a back and forth, but at least a half-dozen times each day, you really do the practice. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=429)   I call those surgical strikes, peppering the day. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=432)   It may not be for very long, and when do you do it? 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=435)   You do it when you don't need all your CPU resources to deal with life. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=440)   But when you deal with life, you just deal with life, that's okay. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=444)   You allocate your resources to what you need to do, but during the day there's a rhythm of, you know, 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=452)   needing to allocate resources to take care of business versus needing that less. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=457)   And when you need that less, go back to a well-defined mindfulness technique. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=464)   30 seconds here, 3 minutes there, what have you. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=468)   The combination of the peppering of the day with the surgical strikes plus attitude. 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=477)   Attitude is important for practice in life. 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=482)   And what is the attitude? 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=484)   The attitude to take when you complete the basis here, your morning practice, assuming you do it that way, 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=493)   you want to walk into the day with an attitude, if possible. 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=499)   And what that attitude is, is that this whole day is a monastery, 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=507)   a place where I'm going to apply and hone my skills. 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=512)   And you just think of your, you monasticize your day conceptually. 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=517)   So we don't live, we're householders, we don't live in actual monasteries. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=522)   But you can think of your day as a monastery. 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=526)   And thinking of your day that way, first of all, makes every day meaningful. 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=535)   Every day is meaningful. 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=537)   Either it's meaningful because great stuff happened, or maybe not great stuff happened, 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=543)   but it was a day of productive training. 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=548)   So, this is a Chinese phrase, er shi hao er, every day is a good day. 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=564)   It's a Zen expression. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=567)   And that's what it means. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=569)   There's another one which I won't write in Chinese. 
<br>[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=572)   One Zen master said, the average person is used 24 hours a day. 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=580)   The person of Zen uses 24 hours a day. 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=584)   So, armed with that attitude, and peppering the day, 
<br>[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=594)   this will monasticize the bulk of your day. 
<br>[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=597)   And then you have your formal practice here. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=604)   There is an option, something you can do as a kind of add-on to practice in stillness. 
<br>[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=616)   A structure that will vastly, vastly increase your ability to maintain mindfulness in daily life. 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=628)   And there's an add-on that you can do to practice in motion, which will have the same effect. 
<br>[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=635)   One of the most common laments that I hear is, well, I come to retreats and I can get into all this great stuff, 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=648)   but then when I go back to daily life I can't maintain it. 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=651)   Well, first of all, we have to accept that to a certain extent that is true. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=659)   You come to retreats to get to a new level, you may not be able to maintain exactly the peaks that you reached at the retreats. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=670)   But you don't want it to just go back to square one, okay? 
<br>[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=675)   You want it to be some sort of plateau, and then your next retreat leads you to some sort of plateau. 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=682)   So, you keep this up for however many years you live, there's going to be probably an exponential envelope to that sort of step-wise growth curve. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=694)   In general, retreats tend to take us to a new level, but we don't want that to be a peak experience. 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=700)   We want to maintain that. 
<br>[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=702)   And we want to maintain that not only in terms of our experience in formal practice, but we actually want to elevate the base level of mindfulness in daily life. 
<br>[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=715)   Remember, the long-term effect of this practice is to elevate the base level of mindfulness in daily life. 
<br>[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=724)   You'll recall I defined your base level of mindfulness to be how clear, concentrated and equanimous you are when you're not trying to be that way. 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=734)   Intentionally, that's the base level. 
<br>[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=737)   You want to reset that base level over and over and over again. 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=740)   So, there's a special version of practice in stillness that you can do that will tend to elevate the base level of mindfulness when you're not trying to be mindful. 
<br>[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=754)   Just what you have in daily life. 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=756)   And there's something you can do here. 
<br>[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=758)   So, I've already actually described them. I do it every retreat. Now I'm going to do it again. 
<br>[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=764)   But it might help to sort of see it visually. 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=768)   So, if you come to me and you say, I am not satisfied with my base level of mindfulness in daily life. 
<br>[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=776)   Just how I am when I'm not trying to be. 
<br>[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=779)   If you come to me, I will ask you, did you try this? 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=786)   And have you tried this? 
<br>[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=789)   If you say no, I'm just going to say, try it, and then come back to me. 
<br>[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=795)   So, what is this here? I wrote TP. 
<br>[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=799)   And I wrote MC. 
<br>[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=802)   This is slightly new vocabulary. 
<br>[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=805)   I've used other phrases previously. 
<br>[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=808)   So, for today, what we're going to call the add-on to practice in stillness. 
<br>[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=813)   Actually, well, yeah. 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=816)   The add-on to practice in stillness. 
<br>[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=818)   I'm going to call it trigger practice. 
<br>[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=823)   Those of you that have been to previous retreats or done the home practice, I've talked about media practice. 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=832)   Well, trigger practice is a generalization of media practice. 
<br>[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=836)   And motion challenge, or a challenge sequence in motion. 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=844)   You've heard me talk about before, but let me explain. 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=848)   So, what is, and I talked about this in this retreat, but let's just say it again for the sake of systematic completeness. 
<br>[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=858)   So, often when we do practice in stillness, we're just sitting there, not a whole lot comes up. 
<br>[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=869)   Okay. Sometimes things come up, depending on the rhythm of life and our own subconscious unwinding. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=880)   But a lot of times, not a lot comes up. 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=883)   But as soon as you're bopping up in the world, as soon as you turn on the 6 o'clock news, 
<br>[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=889)   as soon as you negotiate the freeway or the workplace or the family or whatever, stuff's coming up. 
<br>[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=899)   So, I encourage people to work smart. 
<br>[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=907)   I remember years ago hearing an interview by a Japanese baseball player who was playing in the US. 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=918)   And they asked him to contrast the difference between baseball in Japan versus baseball in the United States. 
<br>[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=928)   And he said, the Americans are stronger, but I think we Japanese play smarter. 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=935)   Well, I would like to reverse, I'd like to turn the tables on that. Okay. 
<br>[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=943)   The way people get enlightenment in Japan, in a Zen temple, hey, this is samurai boot camp. 
<br>[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=952)   This is brute force. This is brute force training. 
<br>[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=957)   It's anti-intellectual, it's no-mind, it's just a body beaten into submission through exhaustion and etc., etc., etc. 
<br>[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=970)   Until you just give up and go into the no-self. 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=974)   So, it's strong. It's a lot stronger than what you or I are willing to do. Okay. 
<br>[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=982)   Let's work smarter. 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=990)   So, how do you work smart? You train yourself systematically. 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=994)   What comes up in the day? Well, joy, interest comes up, rage, terror, grief, in the extreme case, 
<br>[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1004)   irritation, nervousness, poor me, what have you, stuff comes up. 
<br>[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1015)   But in stillness, you see, when we're doing practice in stillness, it's the ideal place to train. 
<br>[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1024)   It's analogous to the empty parking lot where you're going to learn how to drive, and there's no pressures on you. 
<br>[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1033)   But then, what's daily life? Hey, that's LA freeway at rush hour, in the smog, with people shooting at you. 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1042)   So, it's not the best place to just devote yourself to training the skills of driving. 
<br>[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1053)   You're going to have to have parking lot first. 
<br>[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1056)   So, what the bad news is, the empty parking lot doesn't have typically the full range of stuff you need to deal with. 
<br>[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1065)   And I don't just mean negative stuff, I mean the full range of everything. 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1069)   So, you can, upon occasion, do practice in stillness where you are exposing yourself to sound sights or physical sensation 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1080)   or some combination thereof that is likely to trigger the full range of things you want to deal with. 
<br>[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1087)   So, you can sit there, you can close your eyes, you've got the remote control, and you can listen to whatever you want to listen to. 
<br>[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1097)   All the sounds of the world are there. 
<br>[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1100)   And when you're in a deep sitting, I mean, just try it, okay? 
<br>[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1106)   You say you never get images, okay? I never get mental images. 
<br>[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1111)   Well, listen to a real dramatic movie with your eyes closed, okay? 
<br>[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1116)   You'll see image space goes nuts trying to give you an impression of what's going on in that action movie, okay? 
<br>[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1125)   You never get emotional sensations during formal practice? Okay. 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1131)   Close your eyes, go really, really deep, totally go into restful states, then click on the 6 o'clock news and see what happens to your body. 
<br>[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1141)   Or turn on the politician that you most loathe and fear. 
<br>[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1149)   Okay? See what happens to your body. I promise you it will be the limbic system. 
<br>[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1157)   The limbic brain is your emotional brain. 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1161)   They've even done, you might have read on the internet, they've done studies of, and it doesn't matter what your political persuasion is, 
<br>[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1172)   whether you're like liberal, conservative. 
<br>[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1176)   When you are exposed to the opposite point of view, it is absolutely expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1186)   This area here, which is your higher executive function, contracts, okay? 
<br>[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1192)   And your amygdalae and your hypothalamus, I mean your hippocampus, and all of these, this whole emotional brain thing, totally expands in activity. 
<br>[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1208)   It doesn't matter what your political perspective is, okay? 
<br>[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1212)   You're listening with your emotional body. 
<br>[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1215)   And what's interesting, I find that I'm not going to pursue this can of worms any further, 
<br>[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1225)   but both sides try to use this data to prove that the other side is, you know, irrational. 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1233)   Okay, so you can do this kind of trigger practice upon occasion, and you can work with one or a combination of whatever kind of stimuli you want to present yourself to. 
<br>[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1251)   And over a course of time, you simply systematically train yourself to have an automatic, mindful response to every possible trigger that could come up in daily life. 
<br>[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1264)   And when you do it this way, in formal practice, you control the type, the intensity, the duration, and the timing, the frequency of the stimuli. 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1277)   And it's like weight lifting. You don't want to overburden yourself. 
<br>[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1281)   You just work against an edge. You lift an appropriate amount of weight. 
<br>[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1287)   You get stronger and stronger and stronger, and that strength does not then dissipate. 
<br>[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1292)   It's with you in daily life. That's media practice or trigger practice, or for all of them. 
<br>[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1297)   Motion challenges, you, let's say that there's a technique that you'd like to do, and you can do it pretty good with your eyes closed, seated. 
<br>[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1309)   Well, can you do it with your eyes open, seated? 
<br>[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1311)   Can you do it with your eyes open, standing? 
<br>[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1314)   Can you do it walking around in your room? 
<br>[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1316)   Can you do it walking around outside? 
<br>[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1318)   Can you do it walking around in the city? 
<br>[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1320)   Can you do it while you wash the dishes? 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1323)   Can you do it while you prepare a meal? 
<br>[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1326)   Can you do it while you prepare a meal you've never prepared before? 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1333)   Can you do it while you're having a vacuous conversation with the neighbor over the back fence? 
<br>[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1339)   Can you do it when you're having a substantive conversation with someone, maybe a significant other? 
<br>[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1346)   You give yourself a challenge sequence like that for any technique that you would like to learn, to master. 
<br>[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1354)   And that will tend to train you smartly, systematically, to maintain, or to have a high level of baseline mindfulness in daily life. 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1368)   So, this is the day-to-day cycle. 
<br>[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1372)   This is the delta steps for day-to-day cycle. 
<br>[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1375)   So you establish, you do certainly some practice in stillness, but don't forget practice in motion. 
<br>[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1383)   And then you can do the practice in light kind of thing. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1391)   Then, Upsilon, or Y, stands for the year. 
<br>[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1396)   Yes? 
<br>[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1397)   Are you putting trigger practices that are recommended dosage for a week? 
<br>[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1403)   No. Find what works for you. 
<br>[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1406)   But at least try it, at least occasionally. 
<br>[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1409)   Or, if you don't need it, then you don't need it. 
<br>[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1412)   Like I say, if you come to me and say, I don't have enough carryover into daily life, I'm going to say, exercise due diligence, I gave you some ideas, let's work smartly. 
<br>[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1423)   But no, no particular recommended, whatever you think. 
<br>[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1427)   Yeah, a question again on trigger practice. 
<br>[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1429)   In your example, you was like an outsider to a remote control. 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1433)   How about if you intentionally bring up something that you don't have something to do with? 
<br>[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1438)   Okay, very good. 
<br>[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1439)   I call that evoking. 
<br>[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1441)   I have a different term for that. 
<br>[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1443)   I think I gave a spiel about evoking, right, in the group process. 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1447)   Were you here? 
<br>[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1449)   Yes. 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1450)   Okay, so, yeah, I consider that to be yet another thing. 
<br>[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1453)   I don't make that as major as this. 
<br>[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1457)   Because doing the evoking is, I don't think, it depends on the individual. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1463)   I mean, do what works for you, right? 
<br>[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1466)   But evoking still somewhat requires two hats. 
<br>[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1471)   You got to sort of bring the stuff up and then you just got to observe it. 
<br>[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1475)   And even though you separate those tasks, there still are two tasks. 
<br>[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1479)   Trigger practice is completely passive and really controllable. 
<br>[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1484)   And you would, so, it's, you have much more control here. 
<br>[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1489)   You can be much more passive and just do technique. 
<br>[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1493)   And you have the, part of the control is that you can choose exactly the type and intensity of stimulus you want to work with. 
<br>[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1501)   So it gives you the possibility of essentially in a systematic way training yourself for everything. 
<br>[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1509)   I remember I had this, like, huge, sudden, sort of classic breakthrough a very, very long time ago. 
<br>[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1522)   And what I did the next day, I turned on the radio and I found the most disgusting program that I could. 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1534)   It's called Anglo-Israel. 
<br>[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1537)   And what it is, I still remember, it's like, some of you out there may be under the impression that Jesus was a Jew. 
<br>[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1551)   Would God be born as a Jew? No. 
<br>[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1555)   Jesus was like you and I. 
<br>[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1558)   An Anglo-Saxon. 
<br>[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1560)   And then it goes on to try to prove that the inhabitants of England from the 6th century on were in fact the chosen people. 
<br>[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1575)   And that's who the Bible is talking about. 
<br>[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1577)   That's you and I, the white people that live here, the wasps that live here in America. 
<br>[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1582)   So, and then I just listened, okay, and I was in bliss. 
<br>[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1587)   Just totally bliss. 
<br>[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1589)   Whereas before, it would have not been that. 
<br>[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1594)   Okay. So you can find whatever you want to work with. 
<br>[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1602)   Okay, so we've been on Delta Force. 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1607)   What's the P? 
<br>[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1609)   The P up top. 
<br>[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1611)   Pepper. 
<br>[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1613)   The little practices throughout the day. 
<br>[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1616)   Peppering. 
<br>[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1618)   Here's your attitude. 
<br>[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1624)   Okay, so now, the Upsilon cycle. 
<br>[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1628)   The Y cycle. It's year to year. 
<br>[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1630)   So the base of the year to year is just keep this up for the years of your life. 
<br>[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1635)   Keep the Delta up for the years of your life. 
<br>[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1638)   Then, throughout the year at least once, if possible more, do retreat. 
<br>[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1648)   Retreat practice. 
<br>[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1650)   Now, you can slice and dice your retreat practice any way you want, but you want to get some retreat practice in. 
<br>[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1659)   So you know my hobby is math, etc. 
<br>[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1664)   So in math, we often try to imagine something called the trivial case. 
<br>[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1672)   Now, when I say the trivial case, that's not a pejorative, okay. 
<br>[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1676)   It has a specific meaning. 
<br>[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1679)   It's what is the simplest thing we can imagine that still has the characteristic of some structure. 
<br>[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1687)   Okay, a group or a ring or a field or a vector space or, you know, there are these structures. 
<br>[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1695)   What's the simplest case that's not so simple that it lacks that structure? 
<br>[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1701)   That's called the trivial case. 
<br>[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1703)   So I ask myself, what is the trivial case of retreat? 
<br>[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1708)   What is the shortest, simplest, most convenient thing we could possibly do that's not just a long sit, but actually sort of comes under the rubric of retreat? 
<br>[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1722)   And I came up with the four-hour micro-retreats that make up the whole practice program. 
<br>[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1731)   So it's like, okay, it's a four-hour period. 
<br>[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1733)   It's structured in a certain way. 
<br>[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1735)   There's preparation, but all the elements are there. 
<br>[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1738)   There's Q&A. There's a little bit of talk. 
<br>[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1741)   There's even a chance to talk one-on-one with the teacher. 
<br>[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1745)   Not a wide window, but you could if you needed to. 
<br>[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1749)   There's guided practice. There's self-work. 
<br>[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1752)   And it's unbroken continuity of practice for four hours. 
<br>[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1756)   And the delivery system is telephone as opposed to people have to travel, expenses leave their family, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1766)   Well, you know, it works. 
<br>[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1769)   Okay, we've never advertised it, but it's growing exponentially. 
<br>[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1774)   I know when we started we had – they're about twice as large now without any advertising at all. 
<br>[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1781)   And when we finally get it all together, then we'll roll it out. 
<br>[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1787)   When I get everything manualized. 
<br>[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1790)   And then we could probably have thousands of people doing this. 
<br>[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1795)   But in any event, so no one can say that they can't do retreat practice if they speak English and have a telephone. 
<br>[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1806)   And access to a computer at least occasionally. 
<br>[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1810)   And we can tell the world proudly if you cannot afford the token $20, then don't pay anything ever, forever. 
<br>[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1824)   Just get cheap long distance or use Skype, it won't cost you anything. 
<br>[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1828)   And you can do retreats forever for nothing. 
<br>[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1833)   And they're liberation-oriented retreats. They're not light, okay. 
<br>[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1838)   So, to me that's the trivial case of retreat. 
<br>[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1842)   So, if you do one four-hour retreat every single month, that's sort of the equivalent of a half-day retreat per month roughly. 
<br>[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1852)   Okay, well, that sort of adds up to a week retreat. 
<br>[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1857)   That would be a residential situation. 
<br>[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1860)   This is bare minimum. 
<br>[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1862)   By the way, bare minimum for formal practice day-to-day is ten minutes. 
<br>[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1868)   There is, I repeat, an infinite difference. 
<br>[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1873)   Infinite difference. The ratio of ten to zero is infinity. 
<br>[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1878)   Okay, there's an infinite difference between doing ten minutes each day and doing no minutes each day. 
<br>[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1886)   And there's no one that can say, oh my day is so busy I don't have ten minutes. 
<br>[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1891)   If you're not doing the ten minutes, it is not a time thing. 
<br>[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1895)   What is it? It's a resistance thing. 
<br>[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1898)   And when you finally scour down into what the resistance is, you will probably discover it's not that big a deal. 
<br>[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1906)   Fifty percent of the time the resistance is in the subtle agitation flavors that come up in daily life 
<br>[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1915)   that you're going to have to face if you... 
<br>[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1928)   stop on the dot. 
<br>[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1930)   So, usually that's all it is. 
<br>[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1944)   Okay, so you can do that. 
<br>[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1947)   But of course if you can do one or two residential retreats, hey, that's really good. 
<br>[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1953)   Or maybe you do one day retreats, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1958)   But try to get some sustained practice where you're doing it for more than an hour and more than two hours. 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1970)   So, periodic retreat and then periodic contact with at least one teacher 
<br>[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1979)   who is competent to sort of give you big picture guidance on your practice touch base. 
<br>[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1984)   Typically it's at the retreat that that contact comes. 
<br>[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1988)   Because you have an interview, an online... 
<br>[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1991)   Even as I say, with the whole practice program, people call me, they only get ten minutes, 
<br>[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=1999)   but at least they can touch base on their practice and I can ask them a few pointed questions and so forth. 
<br>[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2006)   So, if you establish these two cycles, you have a very high probability of being a very happy camper. 
<br>[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2018)   Now that's sort of the big picture of structure. 
<br>[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2026)   Now we need to look at the more micro picture of structure. 
<br>[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2031)   That's the macro structure. What's the micro structure? 
<br>[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2034)   The micro structure is, okay, what techniques are you practicing? 
<br>[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2042)   And as we all... We're going to have to wash this board because it looks like it's beginning to stain. 
<br>[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2050)   We don't want to leave, we don't want to look bad. 
<br>[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2056)   So, the way you could... Assuming you want to use the basic line from the system, 
<br>[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2076)   then you sort of think of this grid. 
<br>[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2084)   It's a three by four grid. 
<br>[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2090)   And then down here you've got another thing that has six boxes. 
<br>[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2098)   Actually, let's put it over here. Then it will follow the theme blast. 
<br>[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2105)   Here is do nothing. 
<br>[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2111)   And here is the possible themes for nurture positive. 
<br>[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2118)   Positive affect, positive behavior, positive cognition, ideal, which is the archetype of a tar thing, 
<br>[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2125)   situations, laws of attraction, manifestation, and other A, B, C, I, S, O. 
<br>[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2133)   So, you can think of organizing what you do in terms of making choices from this array. 
<br>[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2151)   So, there's three basic possibilities. 
<br>[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2158)   One is for a certain period of time, a week, a month, your whole life, whatever, 
<br>[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2168)   you just do one or maybe two techniques. 
<br>[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2180)   It's sort of monolithic. 
<br>[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2182)   It's like, okay, this is a catalog and I'm going to buy this. 
<br>[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2189)   Or maybe I'm going to buy this whole row, this whole column, or this whole row. 
<br>[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2195)   Or maybe I'm going to buy this, or this. 
<br>[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2198)   So, it's sort of like one or two things and that's what you do. 
<br>[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2203)   So, there's no choices, at least for a certain period of time. 
<br>[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2206)   Like I say, a week, a month, a year, your whole life, however you want to do that. 
<br>[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2213)   That's the simplest. 
<br>[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2215)   And because this grid does contain not all, but a significant percentage of every fundamentally distinct strategy for meditation worldwide, 
<br>[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2229)   organized into a unified framework of sorts, it basically allows you to pick from the whole world as to what you'd like to do. 
<br>[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2243)   So, there's nothing wrong with keeping it simple. 
<br>[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2246)   Maybe you want to just explore your body. 
<br>[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2255)   So, you're going to play this row, broad float inside this row. 
<br>[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2260)   And that's all you want to do. 
<br>[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2264)   You just want to penetrate the body in terms of feel in, feel out, feel res, feel flow, and their ventures. 
<br>[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2272)   And that's all you do. 
<br>[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2274)   So, one choice, you're going to play this row. 
<br>[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2278)   And that's what you do. 
<br>[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2279)   Or maybe two choices. 
<br>[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2281)   You're going to play this row, and then I'm going to do loving kindness afterwards, so nurture positive affect. 
<br>[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2287)   So, that keeps things simple. 
<br>[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2289)   There's nothing wrong if that appeals to you, with keeping things simple. 
<br>[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2296)   The other possibility is for a period of time, week, a month, a year, your whole life, you create a set sequence. 
<br>[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2306)   Either it's one that you create yourself, or it's one of the standard ones that I tend to guide people in. 
<br>[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2319)   And that's what you do. 
<br>[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2320)   You go through that sequence. 
<br>[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2321)   So, it's like a cycle of exercise equipment, or a yoga thing. 
<br>[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2329)   And you can actually repeat the sequence. 
<br>[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2331)   That can be very interesting. 
<br>[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2332)   You can cycle through it. 
<br>[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2333)   You can go through more than once if you want. 
<br>[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2336)   The common sequences that I give people are the modality sequence, where we broad float, broad float, broad float, 
<br>[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2352)   then really broad float, then just not gone, and then choose one of these. 
<br>[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2360)   Then there's the theme sequence, where you play the columns. 
<br>[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2363)   Broad float, this column, this one, this one, so in, out, rest, flow, then you go to do nothing, then you go here. 
<br>[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2373)   Of course, this chart, if you sort of look at it this way, is that cycle. 
<br>[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2379)   It actually is a picture of the theme cycle. 
<br>[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2382)   You can also do a mini blast with regards to one of the columns and rows. 
<br>[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2389)   For example, let's say you really, see, there's actually four techniques represented by this column. 
<br>[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2397)   There's each of these individual, and then there's play the whole column. 
<br>[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2401)   So, this is the focus in family of techniques. 
<br>[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2405)   So, you could play the whole column, broadly float, then scroll through, five minutes here, five minutes here, five minutes here, say, 
<br>[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2415)   and then broad float again. 
<br>[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2417)   So, what have you done? 
<br>[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2418)   You get the big picture, then you go in for close up, now you're back to the establishing shot, 
<br>[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2423)   but when you come back to the establishing shot, because you've done all this close up work, 
<br>[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2428)   things are likely to be more mindful, maybe more pleasant, more fluid, etc. 
<br>[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2434)   So, you can do like a mini blast for a column. 
<br>[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2439)   You can do the same thing for a row. 
<br>[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2442)   You can focus on C in general, and then touch base with in, out, C in, C out, C rest, C float, 
<br>[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2450)   and then go back, do the whole thing. 
<br>[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2452)   Maybe you want to create that kind of set sequence. 
<br>[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2455)   So, you could do a theme blast, a modality blast, you could do a mini blast for any of the rows or columns, 
<br>[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2462)   or create your own personalized workout. 
<br>[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2466)   Now, let's say that you want to incorporate some things from this system, 
<br>[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2472)   but you also want to do other things that aren't in this system. 
<br>[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2476)   Well, actually, if you came to me and we discussed it, 
<br>[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2480)   there's probably a pretty good probability that the other thing you want to do that's not in this system 
<br>[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2486)   actually is in this system, because you just haven't thought through all the subtleties of all the options. 
<br>[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2493)   Because half the time when people come to me and say, 
<br>[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2497)   well, this isn't in the system, but I'd like to do it, 
<br>[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2499)   I say, well, you remember that option and that option, 
<br>[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2501)   well, you put those two together and actually it's in the system. 
<br>[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2504)   But let's say it's not. 
<br>[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2507)   Everything that's not in some way covered by this taxonomy, 
<br>[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2513)   I call special exercises. 
<br>[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2518)   And special exercises, I've got my own special exercises, okay, 
<br>[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2523)   that aren't on here that I might give you from time to time. 
<br>[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2528)   So, absolutely do special exercises. 
<br>[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2532)   You can mix and match and slice and dice this paradigm with anything else you want from practice. 
<br>[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2539)   Because to me, I'm a lover, so I see the commonality. 
<br>[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2545)   Anything you're going to do in some way or another is going to develop some aspect of CCM. 
<br>[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2552)   And from that perspective, totally compatible with the basic mindfulness system. 
<br>[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2558)   So, you can, if you might want to, create some sort of sequence where you mix other stuff in. 
<br>[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2565)   That's great. 
<br>[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2567)   However, now the advantage to set sequences is when you exercise a lot of psychospiritual muscle groups. 
<br>[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2576)   The disadvantage is it's a little more complicated than just doing the same thing every day, keep it simple. 
<br>[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2584)   The greatest complexity comes when you loop and brash. 
<br>[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2592)   So, these are terms from computer programming and so forth. 
<br>[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2599)   Now, this is what I do in my practice, but that doesn't mean it's what you need to do. 
<br>[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2607)   What works for one person doesn't necessarily at all work for another person. 
<br>[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2617)   So, although you might think of it as a decision tree, it is actually not mathematically a tree. 
<br>[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2627)   It's actually a cyclic graph, because you can loop as well as branch. 
<br>[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2637)   So, you sit down and you determine a starting place. 
<br>[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2641)   Where am I going to start? 
<br>[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2644)   So, that's technique one, whatever that is. 
<br>[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2651)   Let's see if the note is larger. 
<br>[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2657)   So, at some point, you sort of say, okay, well, what am I going to do now? 
<br>[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2665)   And it might be that at that point, you say, well, I'm going to just keep on doing this, because it's working. 
<br>[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2674)   Maybe that's all you do that day. 
<br>[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2677)   But maybe at this point, you say, well, you know what? 
<br>[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2682)   This window or this wall came up, and I would like to switch to this. 
<br>[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2690)   I'm going to branch to this other thing, because that's going to take care of this. 
<br>[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2700)   That's going to optimize my utilizing the window of opportunity, 
<br>[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2706)   or it's going to be an efficient way to deal with the wall that's an advantage over what I was doing here. 
<br>[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2718)   And then maybe you just keep on looping back to that. 
<br>[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2723)   Or maybe at some point, you say, okay, I've dealt with the wall. 
<br>[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2728)   Now let's go back here. 
<br>[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2731)   Or maybe you dealt with the wall and it turned into a window, which says, let's do technique three. 
<br>[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2743)   Then whatever happens, happens. At some point, it's time to end up. 
<br>[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2749)   And so maybe you end up here, or maybe there's a certain TE, a certain technique that you like to end with. 
<br>[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2760)   Maybe it's nurture positive. 
<br>[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2762)   And who knows? Maybe there's a certain TB, a technique you always begin with. 
<br>[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2771)   That's optional. 
<br>[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2774)   And then in between, you loop and branch based on interest, opportunity, necessity, 
<br>[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2782)   but not driven by craving, aversion, and unconsciousness, 
<br>[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2785)   and most importantly of all, not making a big deal about these decisions. 
<br>[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2790)   Everybody follow that logic? You've heard it before many times. 
<br>[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2796)   So that's looping and branching. 
<br>[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2801)   These are cycles. These are branch points. 
<br>[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2808)   So that's really complicated. 
<br>[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2811)   But for some people, that's interesting and optimal. 
<br>[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2815)   So you can do that if you wish. 
<br>[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2819)   So you decide whether you want to have one ball, or whether you want to have a sequence of balls, 
<br>[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2833)   that perhaps you repeat. 
<br>[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2836)   Well, you do repeat if you do it the next day, but maybe you repeat during the same session. 
<br>[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2840)   So maybe one or two balls, or a sequence of some sort, 
<br>[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2849)   or you're going to have an algorithm that loops and branches in complicated ways. 
<br>[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnWUutXzRkA&t=2855)   Those are the three ways that you can use the grid to organize your practice.
