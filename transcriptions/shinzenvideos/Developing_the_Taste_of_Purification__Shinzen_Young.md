<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=0)   Purification 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=7)   We talk a lot about purification on this path 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=12)   and especially I hear you talk about it as one of the benefits 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=18)   or events that happen with this practice. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=21)   And I'll speak to my own experience, 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=24)   but purification isn't always pretty. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=26)   And sometimes you can be blindsided with lots of emotion 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=34)   or disconcerting internal talk. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=37)   Could you just speak to this process of working with purification 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=44)   and or how it can arise? 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=47)   What are the different forms of purification that we could experience 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=51)   in terms of working with that as its own phenomenon? 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=56)   Sometimes people confuse the purification and might think that's a new problem. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=62)   When one practices, as time goes on, 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=67)   one develops a kind of sensitivity to something that I call purification. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=77)   In fact, I would say that one of the major watersheds in a person's practice 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=84)   is when they start to develop the taste of purification 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=87)   where they can actually sense that purification has happened. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=91)   So what do we mean by purification? 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=95)   It's a perception that because of the way that I'm experiencing this moment 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=105)   with high concentration, sensory clarity, and especially equanimity, 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=111)   because of the way I'm experiencing this moment, 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=115)   things that have been getting in the way from the past are getting worked through. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=122)   And you actually sense that that is happening. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=126)   Now, how do you sense that? 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=128)   That's hard to put into words. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=131)   You just develop a... it's like wine tasting. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=134)   Tasters can detect all sorts of subtleties in flavor, bouquet, finish, tannins, what have you. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=144)   They just develop the palate to detect stuff that the average person doesn't detect. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=150)   At some point, every meditator who stays with the process 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=155)   develops this sense that because of how I'm experiencing the present, 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=161)   the past is being worked through. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=164)   Like I say, I can't put into words how you know it's happening, but you just do. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=170)   You also know that because of that, every moment in the future is going to be better for you. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=178)   So that's a huge watershed in practice, 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=182)   because before that happens, your preoccupation with regards to meditation 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=188)   is to have certain experiences while you meditate. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=192)   You want to be concentrated, you want to be calm, you want to have altered states, 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=197)   you want to have whatever you want to have. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=200)   Feel good, have something interesting and entertaining or unusual happen. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=205)   When people start their practice, that's how they evaluate their practice. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=209)   It's like, oh, something good or interesting or unusual happened, 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=214)   so that was a good meditation. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=217)   At some point, if you stay with it, you develop this sensitivity for the purification. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=223)   And then your motivations shift. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=228)   You're not interested in getting to any particular state. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=233)   You're interested in setting the stage for nature to optimize purification. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=241)   You set the stage and let time pass, and the purification is taking place, and you can taste it. 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=251)   And because you can taste it, you don't mind if you're in a lot of pain in your body, 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=259)   you don't mind if there's a lot of emotions in your body, 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=263)   you don't mind if there's a lot of confusion in your mind. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=266)   Because, although by all ordinary ways of thinking, 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=271)   pain in the body, uncomfortable emotions in the body, confusion in the mind, 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=277)   that's like the last thing in the world anybody would ever want. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=280)   But if you can taste the purification while that's going on, 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=284)   so you know the past is getting worked through, 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=288)   and the future, every moment of the future will be better for me 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=293)   because of how I'm experiencing this present moment, uncomfortable though it is. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=299)   Once that taste of purification kicks in, then you start to grow exponentially. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=306)   The rate of growth takes off in a hockey stick mode. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=311)   When you're saying taste of purification, it's making it sound like, 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=315)   ah, I'm developing a taste. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=319)   You know, when someone's drinking wine, they know they're drinking wine. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=322)   But to know the interpretation of if that is purification, if it isn't purification, 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=328)   and or, my relationship to that is that you said, 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=333)   oh, I don't mind if I'm in pain, I don't mind. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=336)   When you say develop a taste, do you mean where that starts to become a pleasant experience? 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=341)   I would say that whenever a person in the present moment 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=347)   brings a quality of concentration, clarity, and equanimity to their experience, 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=353)   or even one or two of those, at any level whatsoever, 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=359)   purification is happening whether they're aware of it or not. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=363)   Whether they're aware of it or not, it is happening. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=366)   But after long practice, you know it's happening. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=372)   But I cannot describe to you how you know. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=376)   It's another dimension of experience. You sense it. 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=380)   Does knowing help the process? 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=382)   The knowing is what makes the process snowball. 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=387)   That's what gives the exponential growth. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=390)   Because the fact, in other words, you're getting a reward. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=393)   I wouldn't exactly say the reward is pleasure. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=397)   It's another kind of reward. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=401)   How you will typically react with pleasure when you taste purification, 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=406)   the taste itself is not the taste of pleasure. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=409)   It's its own dimension. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=411)   It's just one of those things you have to experience by practicing. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=415)   But once that happens, then no matter how horrific an experience may be, 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=421)   you're getting rewarded in that experience. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=424)   Not necessarily rewarded by pleasure, but rewarded by this something else, 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=429)   this taste of purification. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=431)   So that the more you taste it, the more you're willing to have equanimity. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=437)   The more you're willing to have equanimity, the more you taste it. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=440)   That's called a positive feedback loop. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=442)   And your practice just goes off on a hockey stick curve. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=447)   Before that, it tends to be linear and rather subtle. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=453)   Once the taste of purification develops, 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=456)   you've got this positive feedback loop and it just goes. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=460)   And that's how you make that journey of a million miles in just a few years. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=467)   You only walked 10 miles in the first year. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=470)   But what you don't realize is the longer you walk, the faster you walk. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKrJIV2OEMg&t=476)   And the taste of purification is the main thing that makes that happen. 
<br>
