<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=0)   Once again, take a moment to stretch up and settle in. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=28)   The spine is erect through balance and alignment, less through strength and effort. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=54)   Like a tree expanding to meet father sky, while the whole rest of the body hangs limp 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=64)   and loose, yielding to the contractive force of mother earth. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=74)   This posture is born in between expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=80)   Therefore, the first consciousness, the shoushin, sometimes translated as beginner's mind, 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=92)   the first thing you experience when you sit, exemplifies the ultimate goal of the practice, 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=107)   to give yourself back to the fundamental forces of expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=124)   We've been exploring what I call surface expansion contraction, meaning manifestations of the 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=135)   source that are available to anyone. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=141)   Of course, they may not seem like the source. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=144)   They may seem quite ordinary, sometimes uncomfortable, even problematic. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=157)   A good doctor can cure your disease. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=161)   Probably an extraordinary doctor can convince you you were never sick. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=171)   Let's review what we've explored so far. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=176)   We'll begin with the principle of increase or decrease. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=184)   Something can get more intense. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=187)   Something can speed up. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=190)   Something can get larger in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=202)   Nothing special about that. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=203)   It's expansion though. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=206)   Affirmation, the principle of increase. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=214)   Something can decrease in the same ways. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=218)   Get less intense, where the frequency of an arising can slow down, or something can shrink 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=229)   in one, two, or three dimensions of space. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=236)   Let's take a moment to explore expansion and contraction in this guise. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=245)   You may only be aware of increase or decrease. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=249)   You may be aware of both at the same time. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=253)   Or there might not be any such movement present, in which case it's actually a form of rest, 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=262)   freedom from those two kinds of change. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=269)   The expansion and contraction in the sense of increase, decrease may be in just one part 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=275)   of your being, or in one modality, or one location. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=280)   Or it may be evident broadly throughout your experience, perhaps even a sense that there's 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=290)   always both everywhere. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=302)   Sometimes the expansion-contraction can be cyclic. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=306)   Something expands, then it contracts. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=311)   Or something simultaneously both expands and contracts. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=320)   And then they disappear. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=324)   Sometimes the sense of expansion and contraction can be abiding. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=335)   There's an eternal in and out, in part or all of your being. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=345)   It's all good, it's all natural. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=347)   A certain amount of guessing and groping will be involved if you haven't done a lot of this. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=353)   Recall that one of the dimensions of mindfulness is clarity, and one of the sub-dimensions 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=358)   of clarity is the ability to detect. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=368)   And this is a detection skill, a noticing of a commonality that may be subtle. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=396)   If you wish to label, the labels would be expansion, contraction, both, and rest or 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=406)   none for an absence. 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=766)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=775)   Now let go of that. 
<br>[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=776)   And we're going to explore another manifestation, which is pressure force. 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=786)   Often it's in the body, but it could be in visual and auditory, both inner or outer. 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=794)   You may have a sense that something's pushing in, pulling in rather, or pushing out, or 
<br>[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=800)   doing both at the same time. 
<br>[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=803)   Or there may be no pressure whatsoever anywhere in your being. 
<br>[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=809)   Instead of interpreting pressure as problematic, we're going to just think of it as a force 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=817)   that's moving out or moving in, or moving in both directions at once. 
<br>[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=824)   If it moves in both directions at once, it might interdigitate, sort of pass through 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=830)   itself. 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=838)   Or there might be a clash, an interference. 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=844)   There's no one to blame. 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=848)   If the pressure waves just pass through each other, interpenetrating without interfering, 
<br>[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=855)   like two ghosts walking along a road, move through each other, well, then fine. 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=868)   But if there's a bang, like two cars hitting each other, just have equanimity with that 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=877)   to the best of your ability. 
<br>[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=882)   If there's no pressure, enjoy the freedom from pressure. 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=886)   It's a rest or a non-situation. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=888)   Typically, we have a sense that we need to do something about pressure, ameliorate it 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=903)   in some way. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=904)   And actually, there can be times when that's useful, appropriate. 
<br>[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=910)   But for now, we're just going to observe it. 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=925)   I'm going to get my light. 
<br>[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1222)   Okay, good. Now let go of that and we're going to explore yet another manifestation of expansion-contraction, 
<br>[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1248)   one which is often interpreted as problematic, and indeed is from a certain perspective, 
<br>[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1262)   but from another perspective can be looked upon impersonally and blamelessly as just 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1271)   part of the dance of space. You may be aware of your attention scattering or being flooded, 
<br>[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1283)   you're pulled to more than one thing at the same time, pulled in and out at the same time, 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1290)   or pulled to many places in your body, or pulled to your mind and your body, or your 
<br>[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1295)   mind goes to many places. Scattering, we'll consider that to be a form of expansion. Or 
<br>[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1308)   you may be gripped and held by something. It won't let you go. Often we interpret it 
<br>[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1315)   as I won't let it go. And that can be a valid interpretation, but we're going to think of 
<br>[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1321)   it differently now. Your space is being limited, held. There's nothing personal about it. There's 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1333)   no blame. Scattering is a part of the dance of space. Gripping is part of the dance of 
<br>[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1343)   space. So if there's no scattering or gripping, great, enjoy that as a rest state, a freedom 
<br>[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1351)   from this aspect of expansion, contraction. But if there is, yield to it. Let yourself 
<br>[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1362)   be spread to the six directions or let yourself be nailed down without fighting. Just taking 
<br>[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1382)   it to be the flow of space seems like it's scattering and gripping forces, but actually 
<br>[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1392)   it's just the curvature of space. It's actually an interesting metaphor from general relativity. 
<br>[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1404)   Whole different way to think about things. 
<br>[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1734)   Okay, good. Now we're going to explore one more ordinary manifestation of expansion-contraction. 
<br>[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1754)   But I'll give you a little heads up. There's some subtlety involved in this one. We like 
<br>[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1771)   to get comfortable by resting in some center. Maybe we're enjoying thinking about a certain 
<br>[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1789)   something or we're comfortable in a certain sensory environment. We settle in or, quote, 
<br>[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1807)   get centered. It's comfortable, it's ordering to be centered somewhere, moment by moment. 
<br>[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1827)   If we get ripped away from whatever our center might be, or if we get knocked off center, 
<br>[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1843)   that's interpreted as disorder. And it's often uncomfortable. Then we may scramble to get 
<br>[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1853)   back to center. There's nothing wrong with being centered. But there's something good 
<br>[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1872)   about becoming free from the need to be centered, to have a fixed position, even for a fraction 
<br>[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1884)   of a second. This next exercise will probably involve a considerable amount of guessing 
<br>[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1905)   and groping, and that's perfectly okay. Notice that as soon as you might find a center, something 
<br>[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1924)   is going to knock you off that center, pull you to the right or to the left or in front 
<br>[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1936)   or behind or above or below or in all directions at once. The pull might be visual, auditory, 
<br>[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1947)   somatic, all of them. It could be inner, it could be outer, but as soon as there's a centering, 
<br>[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1959)   there's a de-centering. Who's responsible for the de-centering? Who gives you that gift 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1970)   that sets you free? It's expansion. Something expands somewhere. And it could be very, very 
<br>[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1985)   slight, incredibly subtle, but there's a force to pull you off wherever the comfortable alighting 
<br>[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=1995)   center may be, to de-center. Put alternatively, it knocks the center away or causes a gone 
<br>[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2012)   or a partial gone of wherever the comfortable center might be. When you're aware that your 
<br>[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2033)   center is being tugged or the rug is being pulled, that's expansion doing that. And the 
<br>[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2046)   actual collapse of the center, the slipping of the rug under your feet, is a form of contraction. 
<br>[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2061)   The center will not hold. It dissipates. We'll consider that to be a form of contraction. 
<br>[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2071)   It's very subtle, it's counterintuitive. In one way, having a center itself is contraction. 
<br>[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2080)   In another way, the gone of the center is contraction. Expansion prevents you from getting 
<br>[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2094)   fixated, leaving you with the prospect of learning about a new ordering principle, becoming 
<br>[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2117)   that authentic human that has no fixed position. The disappearance of the center, however, 
<br>[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2131)   is contraction. The force that causes it is expansion. Those forces are a primordial ordering 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2144)   principle that can never be disordered, and to the extent that you have one foot firmly 
<br>[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2149)   placed in each, you can travel effortlessly back and forth between heaven and hell with 
<br>[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2161)   impunity. If you're aware of your center being even slightly messed with, interpret that 
<br>[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2188)   as contraction and let it happen. Don't hold on. Move on. But also notice that's happening 
<br>[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2199)   because of expansion. You're simultaneously expanding and contracting. And it's liberating. 
<br>[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2213)   I fully appreciate that the words I just spoke may seem utterly inscrutable. That's okay. 
<br>[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2229)   Just explore. In five minutes, five years, 15 years, 15 minutes before your death, they 
<br>[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2245)   may be very significant. 
<br>[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2605)   So far, all of the aspects that we've been looking at are ordinary. Something gets more 
<br>[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2621)   intense or speeds up or larger. There's an outward pressure force or a scattering force 
<br>[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2632)   or a force that pulls you out of a comfortable position in consciousness. Or something decreases 
<br>[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2652)   or slows down or gets smaller or there's an inward pressure force or a gripping force 
<br>[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2660)   or a disappearance of the ability to hold a center. De-centered, knocked off center. 
<br>[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2682)   Related with all of the above may be an awareness of deep expansion contraction or not. Deep 
<br>[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2700)   expansion and contraction is a sense of space effortlessly spreading, effortlessly collapsing 
<br>[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2710)   or doing both at the same time. Or being perfectly still. No movement from or towards. Deep expansion 
<br>[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2733)   and contraction lies around, behind, within. All of the ordinary things we've been looking 
<br>[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2741)   at. Sort of hidden. The reason for looking at surface expansion and contraction is it 
<br>[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2756)   directs your attention to possibly detecting the effortless dance of space that is the 
<br>[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2766)   primordial great perfection that proceeds and follows each sensory and motor event. 
<br>[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2776)   And actually if you understand deeply you'll realize it pervades each sensory and motor 
<br>[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2788)   event. From the good back to the good without ever leaving the good is to live at the source. 
<br>[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2801)   To live near fauna. Now let's explore the possibility, certainly not the certainty, 
<br>[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2816)   but the possibility that something like that might be available to attention at this time. 
<br>[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2825)   All that will be associated with the ordinary stuff. Something gets more intense there tends 
<br>[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2833)   to be a spreading. Something speeds up there tends to be a spreading. Something gets larger 
<br>[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2841)   obviously there's a spreading. But sometimes the pressure could cause a spreading. The 
<br>[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2851)   scattering is definitely a spreading. And likewise for the converse. So sort of letting 
<br>[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2862)   go of the sensory content and becoming fascinated with the spirit contour. Let's just explore 
<br>[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2875)   the possibility that you might be able to detect at this time the deep version. And 
<br>[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2884)   if that's not available that's perfectly okay. Just choose one or a combination of surface 
<br>[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2890)   expansion contraction to attend to. 
<br>[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2907)   Absolutely wow. 
<br>[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=2995)   Sometimes deep expansion and contraction is cyclic. 
<br>[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3020)   There's a both and then a God of both of them. 
<br>[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3027)   Both rest, both rest cyclically. 
<br>[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3035)   Typically small pieces of experience are born in those small cycles. 
<br>[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3040)   An itch here, an image there. 
<br>[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3048)   But sometimes the awareness of expansion and contraction is eternal. 
<br>[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3056)   It's always both. 
<br>[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3060)   Peppered by an absolute tranquility. 
<br>[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3070)   It's always none. 
<br>[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3083)   The reason it's always both and always gone everywhere is because of all those little 
<br>[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3093)   cycles they sum up. 
<br>[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3098)   To an eternal efflux and reflux. 
<br>[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3105)   A formless fountain of youth. 
<br>[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3114)   A formless spirit womb whose peristalsis births self and world moment by moment. 
<br>[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3141)   It may just be an idea for you at this time. 
<br>[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3145)   That's fine. 
<br>[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3149)   But let's explore the possibility of an experience. 
<br>[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3173)   Be filled. 
<br>[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3251)   Now in a moment, we'll transition from formal practice to a bit of discussion. 
<br>[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3280)   Decide how you'd like to practice intentionally, if at all, during the discussion period. 
<br>[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3290)   You could maintain formal practice. 
<br>[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3293)   You could have something sort of going in the background. 
<br>[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3297)   You could pepper it with micro hits or just suspend the involvement and enjoy the conversation. 
<br>[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3307)   But make it a clear decision. 
<br>[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3308)   It's all good. 
<br>[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3312)   Recall that the goal is to maintain formal practice at all times other than the possibility 
<br>[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3318)   of during talks and discussions and such. 
<br>[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg6PTbZ9hDw&t=3327)   Thank you.
