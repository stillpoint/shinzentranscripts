<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=0)   Meditation on the Phone 
<br>[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=5)   But there was something you referred to earlier on 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=9)   in terms of teaching meditation to people on the phone. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=16)   And that piqued my interest a bit, 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=18)   and I wasn't sure, I don't think I've ever heard of anyone 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=22)   teaching someone to meditate on the phone. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=25)   So could you just tell me a little bit about what you mean there 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=29)   and how that happens? 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=31)   Well, I wanted to create a fully modern delivery system. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=37)   After I had sort of reformulated the techniques 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=41)   in terms of the five ways, which was one tier or level of creativity, 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=47)   then I turned my attention towards the issue of, 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=51)   well, now I've got a modernized version of the classical paths to enlightenment, 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=58)   how do I make this easily available to people around the world? 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=63)   And so if you think about it, traditionally what people do is 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=73)   they do some daily practice, maybe 10, 20 minutes, 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=77)   a half an hour a day, what have you, 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=79)   and then they do periodic intensive retreats, 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=83)   which typically would be a day or a weekend or a week or two weeks 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=89)   or three months or in Tibet, three years, three months, 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=93)   and three days in a cave, et cetera, et cetera, 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=96)   some combination of day-to-day practice 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=99)   plus some sort of periodic intensive practice, 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=103)   typically done with a group, although not inevitably. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=108)   That rhythm of practice is the standard formula. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=113)   If you maintain something like that, 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=118)   then the passage of time will mark the process of psycho-spirituality. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=123)   That's the six months to... 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=125)   When you talked about how long it takes for us to begin to see the results 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=129)   and you said it might be six months to a year. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=131)   Six months to a year. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=133)   That's not including this three-month retreat thing. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=136)   You don't have to do three months, certainly not three years. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=141)   But I think that a person does need to do 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=145)   some day-to-day practice on their own. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=149)   I tell people the minimum is 10-4, 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=155)   10 minutes most days of working on your own, 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=158)   then at least four hours of continuous intensive retreat once a month. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=165)   And what does that mean, four hours of... 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=169)   No, you don't sit without moving, 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=171)   but you have unbroken practice for four hours, 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=174)   but you may get up and stretch and do things like that. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=178)   So it occurred to me that most people in the world 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=184)   are not in a position to take even four hours out to go to a center. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=191)   They have a family situation, they have a work situation, 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=198)   they probably don't live near a mindfulness center, 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=205)   they can't incur the expenses, the lost wages, 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=212)   the travel expenses, the expenses of being in a venue 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=216)   where you have to get lodging and meals if you do residential retreats. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=221)   So a way to make all of the features of a group residential retreat 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=230)   available to anyone in the world and circumvent these problems 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=236)   would be to pipe it into the individual's home in four-hour blocks. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=243)   And that would be with a conference call. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=247)   Is this a recording? 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=249)   No, it's live. It's me or my facilitators live. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=255)   So the way it works is you go to basicmindfulness.org 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=259)   and you register for a retreat. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=264)   The programs are always on the second weekend of the month. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=270)   One two-hour program on Friday evening, 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=273)   two four-hour programs on Saturday separated by an hour, 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=277)   and then two four-hour programs on Sunday. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=280)   So that's the second weekend of every month you know that you can plan ahead. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=284)   Do you have to do the whole, are they sequential? 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=287)   No, they're completely independent of each other. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=289)   So I could just do four hours on Sunday? 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=291)   You could do just two hours on a Friday. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=294)   So it can be as short as two hours on Friday, 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=297)   and it can be as long as Friday, two four-hour periods on Saturday, 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=303)   and two four-hour periods on Sunday, 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=305)   since you've taken the whole weekend for practice, 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=308)   and anything in between. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=310)   The programs are all independent. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=313)   You register for them individually. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=316)   And so it's sort of like dharma on demand. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=322)   You might say you decide what you're interested in. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=326)   But it's all unified around the five ways. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=331)   I'm sorry, are you sitting there holding a phone to your head for eight hours? 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=335)   No, you don't hold the phone. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=337)   You either use a speakerphone or you get from Radio Shack a hands-free headset with a microphone. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=345)   It costs you $20. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=347)   You put that, replace your handset with the headset so that you've got a hands-free operation. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=353)   If you're going to do the programs with consistency, it's worth it to buy the headset or to get a speakerphone. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=360)   So you're sitting there, your eyes are closed, 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=364)   and everybody calls in to the number. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=372)   There's from 40 to 90 people on the call, depending on various factors. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=379)   From all over? 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=380)   All over the world. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=382)   All at the same time? 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=383)   All at the same time. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=384)   Oh, how neat is that? 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=386)   And many of them know each other because they've been on site programs together. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=394)   Because I also go around the country and run residential retreats, so people know each other. 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=400)   I know who's on the call. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=401)   Yeah, well, everybody introduces themselves. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=404)   So you see, people thought, well, gee, it's telephone, it's going to separate people. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=410)   But actually, we found that it very much unites people. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=413)   It creates a virtual community of practice. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=417)   So what happens is it starts precisely at the posted time, 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=424)   but people typically call in 15 minutes early, and there's just free schmoozing and socializing. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=431)   Schmoozing is important. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=432)   Yeah, that's an ancient Sanskrit word. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=436)   It builds community and builds a camaraderie so that when the guidance starts, 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=444)   well, I claim to take the mist out of mysticism, and I don't like things to be mystical schmistical. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=451)   But there are some mystical schmistical things. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=454)   I can't really explain how that bonding takes place, because after all, it is just people on a phone. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=464)   But somehow, it's like you're in the same room. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=468)   It's really weird. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=470)   Just knowing that they're there and the fact that you've had this socializing before and what have you, 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=476)   it's like you sit really strong, and you've sensed the presence of these other people. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=483)   Plus, you usually have your eyes closed most of the time anyway, 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=486)   so even if they were in the room, you'd have your eyes closed. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=489)   Yeah, something happens that is a synergy that's more than I expected. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=496)   So what happens is you call in, and you choose the program you want, 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=500)   and every month there's an intro program so that you can start up any time. 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=507)   I call it the Home Practice Program. 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=510)   You get it off of basicmindfulness.org to register and to find out about it. 
<br>[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=516)   But the way it's set up is you can begin any month. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=522)   There's always a program for first-timers that's an intro to one of the five ways, 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=531)   and you can begin with any one of the five ways. 
<br>[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=533)   So if I've never meditated before, once a month there's some way I can call in 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=539)   and have someone guide me from scratch, like I have no idea what to do. 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=543)   Any of the programs that say Part 1, so Focus In Part 1, Focus Out Part 1, 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=549)   Focus on Rest, Change, and Positives. 
<br>[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=552)   Those are the five ways? 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=553)   Those are the five ways. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=555)   All the Part 1 programs require no previous experience whatsoever. 
<br>[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LxX0nVJ5HA&t=560)   Great. 
<br>
