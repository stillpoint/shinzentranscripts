title: "Shinzen, the Mindful Math Geek"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=0)   You have often called yourself a geek. 
<br>[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=9)   I don't want to call you a geek unless you've already done it. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=15)   Have you always been a math science person? 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=19)   No, actually I did extraordinarily poorly in math and science in school. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=28)   I hated it and it was a source of huge consternation in my family when I would come back with D's 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=36)   and F's in junior high and high school. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=43)   My dad was good at math and he liked it. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=47)   They expected me to perform well in school, but I did poorly in general in school and 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=53)   particularly poorly in the area of the math and science classes. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=58)   So when I would get home, there'd be a shitstorm around my report cards. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=69)   So actually, initially I hated it, like I guess a lot of people do, and I did poorly 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=77)   in it. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=78)   Very poorly in it, actually. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=80)   And I had a lot of emotional scarrings around that in my life. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=85)   What do you mean? 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=87)   Well I had a lot of self-doubt and anger and fear and sadness, emotions around my inability 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=100)   to be able to understand these subjects. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=105)   And how did you go from that to delight at scribbling mathematical formulas on a piece 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=111)   of paper as you do now? 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=113)   Well, first there was a motivation. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=117)   I had a conjecture way back in the early 70s that something stunningly important could 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=126)   come about if the best of the East and the best of the West were to mate and cross-fertilize. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=136)   The best of the East is the internal science of meditation, especially in my opinion, mindfulness, 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=146)   which in many ways shares the methodology of science. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=150)   You divide and conquer, you break things into their elements, you see how they interact. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=155)   It's very quantifiable, actually. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=158)   So it occurred to me, having reached the peak of Asia, the pinnacle of that culture, which 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=167)   is the internal science of meditation, what peak remains? 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=171)   Well, if we look at the landscape of all of human culture, the only comparably impressive 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=179)   peak is Western science. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=182)   So I wanted to study Western science when I came back from the monastery because I knew 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=188)   that I would meditate my whole life. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=190)   And I felt that sometime in the future, the dialogue between Western science and Eastern 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=196)   practice would become important in human history. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=200)   And I wanted to be able to participate in that, not merely as an expositor of meditation, 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=206)   but as somebody who knew something about Western science. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=211)   So when I got back, providentially, I met someone who was very good at math and science. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=221)   And he gave me one really good piece of advice. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=225)   He said, if you want to master the sciences, do the math first. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=230)   If you ace that, you can do any class. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=233)   You can do physics, you can do chemistry, you can do biochemistry, you can do neuroscience, 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=239)   but you have to be able to do calculus and topology and other branches of mathematics. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=245)   So I got this good piece of advice, which is really master math, and then you'll be 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=251)   able to ace your science courses. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=254)   The only better piece of advice I would give somebody is learn to meditate because that 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=261)   will allow you to undo all the previous conditionings you had around math and science and be good 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=269)   at it. 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=270)   And I'm living proof that that can happen. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=272)   I used my meditation, since I had a motivation now, okay, I'm going to apply my meditation 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=280)   practice to doing something I am absolutely convinced I'm incapable of doing and have 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=286)   a lot of emotional baggage around. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=290)   So I'm absolutely convinced I can't do this and I've got the high school and junior high 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=295)   records to prove it, okay, and I've got all these emotions from my family around it. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=302)   So how am I going to use the meditation to overcome this? 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=306)   Three things. 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=308)   Meditation gives you concentration power. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=310)   When I was a kid, I'd read the math book, I'd read a paragraph, I didn't understand 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=317)   it. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=318)   I tried to read it again, I didn't understand it. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=321)   I read it again, I didn't understand it, I gave up. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=324)   I didn't have concentration power. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=327)   So now as a meditator, I have concentration power. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=330)   So I kept coming back and coming back. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=333)   I had staying power. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=335)   That made a huge difference. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=337)   I didn't give up on the third time. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=340)   That's 100% through concentration. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=342)   So I had improved concentration, that helped. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=346)   Then, well, I had the conviction I can't do it. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=350)   But where does that come up? 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=352)   That comes up in mental image, internal talk, and emotional type body sensations. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=358)   Every time that would come up, I'd break it up into manageable pieces and just observe 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=362)   it over and over and over again, it came up. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=365)   Well, who are you kidding? 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=366)   You'll never be able to do this shit. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=368)   You've never been able to do this shit. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=370)   Every time it comes up, divide and conquer, you quantumize, love it to death. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=377)   I loved that conviction and the emotions to death. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=382)   Meaning I so affirmed them that they no longer needed to happen. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=388)   Then another little meditative skill is the ability to merge with another person. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=394)   So I started to merge with mathematicians and incorporate within myself the waveform 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=402)   called math geek. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=405)   There is an activity called math geek, a kind of wave. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=409)   I internalized that into my personality wave so that I had a mathematician inside of me. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=419)   Actually a lot of them. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=420)   I did that intentionally. 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=423)   Now the cool thing about math is, oh well, let me just say, what I've just talked about, 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=428)   okay the claim, well you had better concentration so you're going to be able to learn this stuff. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=434)   You had these emotional deconstruction skills so you could free yourself from the influence 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=438)   of the past. 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=439)   And the very weird claim that you can merge with another person and internalize an actual 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=446)   ability from that person. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=449)   I can make these claims, okay, but when I sit down to solve a problem, when I sit down 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=459)   to solve a differential equation, I will either be able to do that or not. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=465)   If I've been bullshitting myself, it's going to show. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=469)   On the other hand, if I can solve a system of differential equations, okay, without looking 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=477)   at the answers, then I know I actually did this. 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=481)   So there's no BS involved here. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=484)   And your enjoyment of it has shifted. 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=487)   Well yes, and it worked. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=488)   You enjoy differential equations. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=490)   Yeah, it worked. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=492)   I started to actually be able to get the answers. 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=495)   I had to start with elementary that you would learn in grade school. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=503)   I had to start with multiplication and addition tables. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=506)   I knew nothing. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=509)   And now I do topology and category theory and homological algebra and stuff that you 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=519)   would do in graduate school, math courses. 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=524)   That is 100% self-taught and applying the meditation. 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=532)   And you know it's not BS because you can do it. 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cVBohQ2x1c&t=534)   And yes, that becomes this huge source of joy. 
<br>
