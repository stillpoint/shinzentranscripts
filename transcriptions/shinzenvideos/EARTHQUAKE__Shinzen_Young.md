<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=0)   Now that sounds like the wealth of the earth, meaning that it could become a major turning 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=23)   point in the history of our species. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=29)   We're having an earthquake. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=31)   Is that what that is? 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=34)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=35)   It's my first earthquake. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=38)   I've been waiting 14 years. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=44)   Well, I hope you weren't disappointed. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=51)   That ain't much of an earthquake, baby. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=59)   We have some entertainment up here in Palos Verdes just for y'all for tonight. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=62)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=64)   They seem to happen on Friday nights like this. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=66)   Our second one in about two months on a Friday night, just about this time. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=72)   Oh no, that's great. We were enjoying it. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=76)   Chell is having a complete experience. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=82)   What can I say? We could do a lot better than that. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=91)   Yeah, we don't get them on the East Coast very much, it's true. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=99)   The earthquake, yes. What to do when the earthquake comes. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=109)   Well, there's a Zen koan. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=116)   Anyone care to answer? What to do when the earthquake comes. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=121)   That's the explanation. Or the manifestation. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=129)   My explanation would be you can't shake the shaking. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=137)   But permanence, complete experience, actually does feel like an earthquake. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=145)   That earthquake was on cue for me. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=149)   At least I'm going to interpret it that way. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=153)   I was just about to say that when you have a completed experience, 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=158)   it feels like an earthquake. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=161)   It shakes heaven and earth because it is the authentic person without a fixed position. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=172)   I wasn't going to relate it to an earthquake. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=178)   But it is a reasonable comparison and one, in fact, that I have made numerous times in the past. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=188)   One of the times when I knew that this practice was really doing something industrial strength for me 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=200)   was when we had the center, some of you were around back that far, on Eldon Avenue, remember, in Koreatown. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=209)   One morning I had to go in to do something that I'd forgotten. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=220)   I had gotten in my car and then I said, oh, I forgot to do that. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=225)   I ran into the center and I left the keys in the car. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=232)   It's downtown, right? 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=235)   And sure enough, like two minutes later I came out, the car is gone. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=244)   And what was that experience? 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=247)   I'm remembering it because at the time it was just like an earthquake. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=254)   That's all. There was no thought, there was no emotion as an object. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=260)   It was so complete that it was just space rocking. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=266)   It was just like that last penultimate scene in the first Matrix when... 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=279)   What's the name of the character? 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=281)   Neo. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=283)   Neo, yeah, Neo realizes who he is, right? 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=290)   And the whole frame of the movie sort of goes like that. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=298)   I mean, that's really what it was like. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=300)   It wasn't just my mind and my body, it was the sight and sound, everything. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=306)   The whole frame of the self and scene was just this wave. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=314)   And then it was just like being massaged. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=320)   And then I just went in, called the cops, and that was that, you know, reported it. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=327)   That was dramatic. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=329)   That was a complete experience of having your car swiped in downtown L.A. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=339)   The gangbangers that took it were so stupid, they put their graffiti in it. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=347)   And the cops busted them. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=351)   I eventually got the car back. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvzpHVjyhc&t=355)   Left the graffiti just for the cultural.
