<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=0)   So we're talking about, okay, I said, I actually contrasted spacious versus dense. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=16)   So for me, dense just means not spacious. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=21)   Okay? 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=22)   Now here's where it gets, where you have to be really careful about words, and this is 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=26)   exactly the point you brought up, which I was wondering if anyone would bring up, actually. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=33)   So good for you. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=37)   When you get into very highly concentrated states, you can get a sense that things are 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=44)   thickening or getting, quote, dense, but it's pleasant, and it's unifying and also liberating. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=59)   That's contractive flow. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=61)   That's another flavor of contractive flow, the feather-like paper. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=66)   See expansion and contraction are technical terms. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=70)   Oh, what about technical terms? 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=72)   Okay, they have very specific meanings. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=75)   Expansion and contraction in my system cover a huge range of sub-flavors. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=85)   The lightness, thinness can be parsed as contractive. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=90)   That jonic, sort of, quote, density could also be parsed as contractive, and they're 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=98)   both pleasant and liberating, just in different ways. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=103)   So that's what I have to say about that. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=105)   Can you maybe compare and contrast the sense of heaviness and thickness, sort of, getting 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=112)   into a certain state versus the quote, unquote, badness, the thickness in a sensory language? 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=119)   Well, one obvious difference is that the quote, bad density hurts like hell, whereas the good 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=132)   density really feels good. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=137)   That's an obvious difference. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=141)   The reason for that difference, if I were to put it in words, is that the quote, bad 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=145)   density comes about from resisting the contractive force, whereas the quote, good density comes 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=157)   about through deeply surrendering to the contractive force. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=161)   There's not that subtle cellular rigidity against contraction. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=168)   And the good density is actually halfway to global gone. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=179)   And global gone is a big deal. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=182)   Global gone is the ninth jhana. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=185)   That's sit there for a week and your breath stops. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=189)   Except you don't die. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=190)   I mean, your breath obviously doesn't completely stop, but you know. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=195)   That's sort of waxy catatonic physiological trance. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=201)   That's good, if you're fortunate enough to be moving in that direction. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_oY6MoQWAs&t=206)   So that's what I have to say about that.
