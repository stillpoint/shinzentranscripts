title: "3 Key Moments for Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=0)   So in your probably early experiences with meditation, can you recall any key moments 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=16)   when you realized experientially that, whoa, this is shifting the nature of my experience 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=25)   in a way I hadn't expected? 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=29)   Probably the first key moment came a few months into the practice when I started to notice 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=37)   that at the end of an hour set, the voice that had always been screaming in my head, 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=47)   although it was still present, it was like at a distance. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=52)   It wasn't screaming anymore. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=55)   I didn't have to listen to it instantly. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=60)   I never experienced anything like that. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=63)   It was like the internal talk, by the end of a set, the internal talk hadn't gone away, 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=68)   but it was like at a distance. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=70)   It was muffled. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=72)   That was a whole new world for me. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=77)   So I went to my teacher and I said, my sitting's getting interesting. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=82)   He said, oh, in what way? and I described this phenomenon. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=85)   He said, oh, that's good. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=87)   You're starting to go into Samadhi, into a state of high concentration. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=93)   So then he said, now you have anything that you experience on the cushion, you must eventually 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=103)   be able to experience in daily life. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=106)   I thought, this is crazy. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=108)   I could barely get a little hint of that quieting of internal talk. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=117)   After an hour of focusing on my breath, how can I possibly maintain this in daily life? 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=123)   He said, well, you can't. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=125)   Just do it. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=127)   That was a pivotal experience. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=129)   That was really new and something that who would have ever thought that was possible 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=135)   for someone like me to experience even a few moments of quiet, of internal self-talk. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=144)   I would say the second dramatic thing that ever happened to me came at the end of my 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=151)   first week-long Zen retreat in Japan, which was this horrific killer ordeal. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=161)   It was in the summer, the very first night they broke three sticks over people. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=170)   The mosquitoes were an inch long, they could bite you through your clothes. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=177)   It was like, Japan is very moist, so in summer you're just sweating. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=184)   You're not allowed to move at all, no matter what. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=187)   By the way, this is a good example of what I mean by horrific ordeals that I would like 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=192)   people not to have to go through by working smart with precise vocabulary. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=202)   Because if we talk about this, people say, hey, who would ever put themselves through 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=206)   that? 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=207)   They don't see themselves in that scenario. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=210)   You don't have to do this kind of thing. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=213)   The first time I did do that kind of thing, by the end I nearly had lost my marbles. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=219)   I was starting to have insane ideation, literally insane thoughts, like a torture victim, basically. 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=229)   My whole body was shaking with pain. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=234)   I thought I was going to cry. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=236)   I was sure I was just going to start bawling. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=241)   It was the last sit of the last day. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=246)   I was just holding on. 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=248)   My whole body was shaking. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=250)   I was just holding on for dear life. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=254)   I realized I was about to cry. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=257)   Not just cry, I mean bawl, like break down. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=262)   I started to scream in my talk space, you're not a baby, don't cry. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=267)   You're not a baby, don't cry. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=269)   Over and over again. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=273)   Suddenly, for no reason, I dropped into equanimity, big time. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=284)   It wasn't just the quiet that I described before. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=289)   My entire being dropped into a spontaneous equanimity. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=294)   The way you know that's happened is the pain level is exactly the same, but the suffering 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=300)   level dramatically reduces, or perhaps even goes away. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=307)   In this particular instance, the suffering completely went away. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=313)   I went from near fainting level of pain to my body totally relaxed. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=320)   Yes, the internal talk turned off. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=325)   The pain turned into a kind of flowing energy that was just massaging my being. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=331)   It was like I could have stayed there forever. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=333)   The physical body was literally breaking up into a flow of spirit. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=343)   Then the bell rang that ended that sit. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=347)   I was never the same because you can hear somebody say this, but if you haven't experienced 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=353)   it why should you believe it? 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=355)   I would have never believed that that could be the case. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=359)   That was extremely dramatic. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=361)   A few years later, one day at the end of a day, I sat down. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=366)   I hadn't meditated that day. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=368)   I was doing self-inquiry at that time, asking who am I. 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=373)   At the end of the day, I sat down and I said, who am I? 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=377)   I looked at my boundaries and they vanished. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=383)   They never came back. 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=387)   I was never the same, ever. 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=389)   I didn't sit, I just got up. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=392)   I got up. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=393)   I just started to walk around and communicate with the walls. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=398)   They were like, me. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=401)   So was the whole world. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=405)   When I went to bed that night, I thought, well that's going to go away. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=409)   I woke up the next morning, it was there. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=416)   It never went away, ever. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=418)   My whole life. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=419)   I've been privileged to live. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=421)   How long ago was that? 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=423)   That was after I'd meditated for about four years. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=428)   So it's been four years now, so that was like 35, 36 years ago. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=435)   It has nothing to do with how concentrated you are. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=440)   That was obviously a huge watershed. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sCj9PDyPsg&t=445)   That's what gives me the confidence to teach. 
<br>
