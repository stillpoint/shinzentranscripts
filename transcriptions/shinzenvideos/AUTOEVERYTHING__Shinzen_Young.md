title: "'AUTO-EVERYTHING' ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=0)   So, taken together, I have four standard techniques for training people into what I sometimes 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=17)   jokingly call the Zen bounce or spontaneity or cultivating flow within your motor circuits. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=30)   So one technique is auto move, and an easy way to do that I demonstrated, sort of the 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=36)   auto walk thing. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=38)   Another technique is auto speak, and an easy way to do that is like auto chant. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=46)   The way to cultivate spontaneity and thought is the auto think technique. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=54)   I described that briefly. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=55)   There's actually some more details, but the good news on that is I have a very complete 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=61)   blog in my blog spot where I talk in total detail about how to do the auto thinking technique. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=70)   So that's a third technique. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=72)   Often, I'll use a strategy of having people work with individual elements and then having 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=79)   people work with the whole system. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=81)   So if you want to get crazy, you can auto everything. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=86)   It means you try to taste your body moving while you sort of do some sort of chant, and 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=92)   you're covering your mind space and aware of a global unfixated state there. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=98)   You're doing that all together. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=100)   So that would look something like this. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=106)   1, 2,3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=114)   1, 2,3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=117)   1, 2... 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvSkG9yhA4&t=118)   Thank you.
