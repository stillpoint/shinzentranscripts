title: "UPIAH - Skillful Means or Outreach  ~Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=0)   The bell stands for upaya or karuna. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=12)   So karuna means compassion, but it's bigger than compassion. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=16)   It's really outreach. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=19)   That's why in the Tibetan tradition, karuna and upaya are virtual synonyms. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=26)   Karuna is compassion. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=28)   And upaya, I would translate as, it's often translated, what's the standard sort of artificial 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=36)   Buddhist English translation of upaya? 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=39)   Skillful means. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=41)   You got it. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=43)   So what does skillful means refer to? 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=47)   What is the connotation of the word upaya? 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=50)   Well, if I were to give an idiomatic translation, I would probably translate it something like 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=58)   outreach. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=60)   Remember I said that when you ring the bell, you ring the bell to call people, or you ring 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=64)   the bell to begin or end a set. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=67)   To me, that's like the coolest job to do because you're reaching out. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=74)   The bell, it calls sentient beings back to the source, back to the practice. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=84)   So I would say upaya is the ways that one reaches out in order to engage people in the 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=93)   practice because just sort of trying to sell people on emptiness or suffering, that might 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=107)   be maybe something the general public doesn't exactly relate to right off the bat. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=116)   Guess what? 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=117)   I've got good news. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=121)   You are a soulless robot designed to suffer and too stupid to know that. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=132)   And the only good part is that you're going to die. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=139)   But that's not so great because it's almost certain that the next time around you're going 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=145)   to be born as an even stupider soulless robot suffering even more. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=153)   So this is the Buddhist message. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=157)   And you know what? 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=161)   There's damn good reason to say this, okay? 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=164)   And I don't know about the reincarnation piece, but actually, yeah, I agree with the soulless 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=171)   robot designed to suffer, but that's not exactly the whole picture, fortunately. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=181)   And that is certainly not a way to bring in J. Random human being to the path. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=188)   Just try to convince him of that. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=192)   That's like the Iceman cometh, you know, you're trying to sell a person on death. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=198)   It's like who wants to buy this product? 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=203)   So there are more approachable ways of formulating the same thing. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=216)   And that's upaya. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=218)   So the Buddhist tradition has always thought that it's important to make, to have ways 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=226)   that people can enter the practice. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=231)   Now how do you do that? 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=233)   Well, it's been done differently in different cultures. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=238)   One of the ways, let's be honest, that you get people engaged is you impress them with 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=247)   psychic powers and magic. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=250)   That's something people can relate to in certain cultures at certain times. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=256)   Most cultures in previous times, and that's where Buddhism existed in those cultures. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=262)   So how are you going to convince Kublai Khan to not destroy your temple, but help you build 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=274)   it? 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=275)   Well, you better be able to do magic better than his guys. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=280)   So that was one of the upayas, and it certainly is legitimate, I suppose, within a certain 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=289)   cultural context. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=293)   People like to have their fortune told. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=296)   If you go to a Chinese, I mean, you know, fortune, I mean, we talk about fortune cookies, 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=304)   okay, it's almost like a stereotype, but fortune telling is a really, really old trope in Chinese 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=312)   culture. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=313)   Although, actually, most people don't know that fortune cookies come from Japan. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=319)   Originally, most people don't know that. 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=323)   Look at the Wikipedia. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=324)   That is where they come from. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=326)   But anyway, fortunes, telling your fortune, that's the beginning of Chinese literature. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=331)   That's the I Ching. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=333)   That's what it is. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=334)   It's like how to interpret these hexagrams and so forth. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=340)   So the culture likes to have their fortune told. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=344)   So every Chinese temple, if you talk to the average Chinese person, what do you do at 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=350)   the temple? 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=351)   Why do you go to the temple? 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=353)   Well, you throw these pieces of wood or coconut and they fall in a certain way, and then you 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=362)   like draw a fortune and okay, so it goes. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=367)   So that's a new pie that brings people into your temple. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=374)   Food is a big deal in Chinese culture. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=377)   So Mahayana Buddhism in China is about not eating meat. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=386)   So you develop an incredible vegetarian cuisine and the temples provide that food. 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=395)   So people go, they get a good vibe, they do a good deed, they didn't eat meat, but they 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=402)   ate something that looked and tasted exactly like meat, but was made out of tofu. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=409)   They reproduced all the high cuisine of China in vegetarian food. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=415)   It's an upaya. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=416)   It brings someone into the temple. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=421)   And then, you know, hopefully some connection will be made and from there things will happen. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=430)   So that's all this kind of stuff is looked upon as upaya. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=434)   Upaya is sort of a tricky thing, right? 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=437)   I think you can see that there could be a little bit of a slippery slope here. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=444)   In terms of, well, honesty. 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=452)   You know, people like miracles. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=454)   So hey, you know, miraculous things happen. 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=462)   You know, these, what do they call them, you know, the relics and things that reproduce 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=475)   themselves every day and get more and more and more. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=478)   It's like, hmm, can't help thinking that someone's manipulating that, okay? 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=488)   But well, it's an upaya. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=490)   It can be justified. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=492)   So it's a sort of tricky thing. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=494)   We want to bring people in. 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=495)   We want to make things relevant. 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=499)   You're in 12th century Japan. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=503)   You just came back from China. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=504)   You learned this cool liberation path called Chan or Zen. 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=512)   And who's running the show in 12th century Japan? 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=515)   Samurai. 
<br>[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=516)   They're running the show. 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=520)   So how are you going to get them not to beat you up, but rather to get interested in what 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=528)   you have to say? 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=530)   Well, what's relevant to a samurai? 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=535)   To kill and be killed without fear or conscience is what's relevant to the job of a samurai. 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=544)   You know what? 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=545)   We can provide that. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=546)   You want that? 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=547)   We can provide that. 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=548)   Now, you can say, whoa, that was a bad thing to do. 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=553)   I mean, the Buddha would like... 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=556)   I mean, it's like in the original rules in the Vinaya, Buddhist monks aren't even allowed 
<br>[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=565)   to talk about wars and conflicts, what to say to trained warriors. 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=574)   On the other hand, thanks to that, there are now people in Japan who are enlightened Zen 
<br>[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=585)   masters and taught me. 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=588)   And maybe if that hadn't happened in the 12th century, that would not have been the case. 
<br>[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=596)   I remember the first time I ever stayed in a Japanese Zen temple. 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=600)   It was a place called Mount Pukuchi in Kyoto. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=609)   What I noticed was that these busloads of company workers would come in. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=618)   It would be like three buses and they're all workers from a certain section of a company 
<br>[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=626)   like Mitsubishi or Matsushita or one of these big Japanese companies. 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=634)   They'd all be in suits or in their company sort of... 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=641)   What do we call those? 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=648)   Like... 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=649)   Yeah, or the jumpsuits kind of things. 
<br>[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=656)   I noticed they'd come into the temple, what's going on? 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=660)   So I asked the Roshi, what is this? 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=665)   And he says, well, they send a section of workers to spend a week living in the Zen 
<br>[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=676)   temple together, essentially to do a mini session, a sort of mild retreat kind of situation, 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=685)   but mostly just to be in the temple and see what that's like. 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=692)   So I said, why? 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=694)   Why do the companies do this? 
<br>[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=699)   This is a long, long time ago. 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=701)   This is like 1969 or something. 
<br>[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=706)   1968, way back. 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=709)   First time I was in Japan. 
<br>[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=713)   So why do the companies send their workers? 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=718)   Well, it's a team building exercise is what it is. 
<br>[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=723)   This is Japanese team building, seven to a Zen temple, and toughen them up a little bit. 
<br>[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=730)   Well, you know, it hurts. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=733)   You have to sit still. 
<br>[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=735)   You're tired. 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=738)   And you get a sort of paramilitary team building kind of experience. 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=745)   And that's why the companies do this. 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=747)   They pay for it because it's to their advantage as a company. 
<br>[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=755)   So okay, fine. 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=756)   It's sort of cool, actually, in a way that that's their version of team building, sort 
<br>[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=763)   of classical. 
<br>[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=764)   On the other hand, I did ask the guy pointedly, don't you think that they're exploiting you? 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=774)   You know, just they're using you for corporate goals. 
<br>[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=779)   You're a spiritual teacher, you're a Zen teacher. 
<br>[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=782)   I mean, you know, in those days, I was pretty rude. 
<br>[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=785)   I hadn't done much practice. 
<br>[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=787)   And I was I had a lot of chutzpah. 
<br>[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=790)   And I used to like to ask impertinent questions from people. 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=796)   But that was okay, because I actually learned a lot from the answers. 
<br>[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=800)   Because often the answers were, I was impertinent, but the answers were humble. 
<br>[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=806)   And that was a learning experience. 
<br>[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=809)   So he said, well, it's true, to a certain extent. 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=815)   But if we get 60 people coming in here, maybe one or two of them will take to the practice 
<br>[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=826)   and will continue with it. 
<br>[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=829)   And that justifies doing it. 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=832)   So and then he said, this is Hoben. 
<br>[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=836)   And Hoben is the Japanese word for upaya. 
<br>[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=840)   So this is the outreach. 
<br>[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=843)   So you reach out to people. 
<br>[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=847)   Zen and the art of. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=850)   People like to do art in Japan. 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=852)   They like to do flower arranging and tea ceremony. 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=856)   So you sort of make the possibility that they can get a little bit of samadhi as they are 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=864)   doing their art, their flowers or their tea or whatever. 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=868)   And then this makes things relevant to the culture. 
<br>[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=871)   So what I find interesting is that, of course, history repeats itself. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=880)   Now it's coming to the West. 
<br>[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=885)   How is it making, by it I mean Buddhism, this practice, how is it making a really, I mean 
<br>[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=895)   like really significant inroad into the culture? 
<br>[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=901)   How is that happening? 
<br>[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=906)   It's happening because of the M word and by M I don't mean meditation. 
<br>[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=915)   What's the M word that I'm thinking of? 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=918)   Mindfulness. 
<br>[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=919)   Mindfulness. 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=920)   Oh yeah, that one. 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=925)   This is amazing. 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=929)   Because that word will probably change the course of human history. 
<br>[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=940)   That word. 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=942)   Just the way it's come down now. 
<br>[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=947)   Because mindfulness is an attentional skill set. 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=955)   It can be translated different ways but it's an attentional skill set. 
<br>[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=966)   These attentional skills can be used for everything. 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=971)   They can be used for everything. 
<br>[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=973)   They can be used for pain management. 
<br>[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=975)   They can be used for improving your tennis game. 
<br>[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=982)   They can be used for recovery. 
<br>[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=985)   They can be used for everything. 
<br>[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=988)   It's not terribly threatening. 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=991)   The other M word, it's pretty accepted. 
<br>[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=995)   I mean even the AMA, if you get something, if you have heart or cancer or something, 
<br>[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1003)   you ask the AMA recommendations, that M word, the meditation word, you'll actually find 
<br>[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1010)   there. 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1011)   So that's somewhat acceptable, the M word that means meditation. 
<br>[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1019)   But still, there are sections of society that meditation just sounds weird and an invasion 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1029)   of my personal world. 
<br>[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1032)   It's like asking someone to pray in a certain way, you're asking them to meditate. 
<br>[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1037)   But telling people, hey, we're going to give you some exercises that develop attentional 
<br>[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1046)   skills and then we're going to show you how to apply those attentional skills to what 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1051)   you're interested in, what's important to you. 
<br>[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1055)   If you've got chronic pain, that's important, okay, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1063)   That's something that the average person is not going to catch in their craw. 
<br>[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1075)   It's not going to seem weird or unnatural. 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1080)   Especially one of the things that I've been considering is to not assume that the first 
<br>[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1087)   way you train people in mindfulness is to get them to sit down. 
<br>[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1092)   Because there's really nothing that says you have to start with a seated practice or that 
<br>[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1096)   your eyes have to be closed. 
<br>[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1110)   This is really interesting, because to me, this is the modern upaya. 
<br>[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1118)   We're reaching out to people. 
<br>[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1120)   What I decided to do was, okay, if we're flying under the banner of an attentional skill set, 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1131)   well we want them to apply these skills in a way that they're going to dramatically grow. 
<br>[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1146)   I outlined this in the What is Mindfulness, what this whole strategy is. 
<br>[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1152)   So the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right 
<br>[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1158)   off the bat. 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1161)   So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of concentration kind of 
<br>[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1166)   thing, but they're explicitly developing concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity, and they're 
<br>[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1172)   learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights 
<br>[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1180)   can arise without us trying to get them to believe a certain thing. 
<br>[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1187)   So we're going to provide you with an attentional skill set, we're going to provide you with 
<br>[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1192)   a way of analyzing your sensory experience, which is, it's not any doctrine or belief 
<br>[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1198)   system, it obviously is the case that we see and we hear and we feel. 
<br>[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1205)   And then people can hopefully start to have really significant experiences. 
<br>[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhGAdxx5To&t=1214)   So that to me is a modern and incredible opportunity for upaya.
