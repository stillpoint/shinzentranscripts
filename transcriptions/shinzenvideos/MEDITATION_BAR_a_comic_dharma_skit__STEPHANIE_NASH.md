title: "'MEDITATION BAR' (a comic dharma skit) ~ STEPHANIE NASH"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=0)   Lazy music playing. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=27)   I don't know about you, but after a good retreat, there's nothing I like better than to head 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=38)   down to my local meditation bar and throw back a few techniques. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=46)   Maybe even take home a good procedure or two. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=49)   There's a lot of good places around here, Purification Pub, the Hachmad Hetch, Epikey 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=58)   Attic, Anicca Annex, and the Axis of Ego, which is too noisy for my tastes. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=66)   Just doesn't have a good feel to it. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=69)   Oh, and there's the Clarification Cafe. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=73)   They got booths for eating meditation there. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=77)   A mechanical hand comes down and stops your arm right as you lift the food. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=82)   Then a voice comes on saying, meditate on that. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=87)   Yeah, they got therapists in the next room for when it doesn't work out. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=94)   My favorite place is the Vipassana Vortex. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=100)   Used to be called Zen It Is when it was owned by this guy named Roshi, but he had a lot 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=107)   of activity and moved on to another level of consciousness. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=112)   The Vipassana Vortex is situated in a way that you can see right through it. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=119)   Over the door is a color monitor running Doth in black and white. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=125)   And something in Sanskrit or Pali or maybe it's Chinese. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=132)   I'm told it translates a part sight, through sight, and insight. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=138)   All fit fits welcome. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=142)   Cho greets me at the door. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=145)   She runs the place. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=147)   A great dame with a solid gold heart and a smile to match. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=153)   She says, is that a guru in your pocket or are you just happy to be here? 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=161)   I smile and head over to the bar for a clarity cocktail. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=166)   I got some fuzzy aspects. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=169)   I could use a good buzz. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=173)   The bliss bunnies are circulating and free floating throughout the room giving out labels. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=180)   Sometimes they take you upstairs and show you a rising and falling. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=186)   There's usually some flow there too. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=191)   There's my friend Will. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=192)   He's got a horse named Charlie. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=195)   Yeah, Will's a lot like Charlie Horse, but he'll never see it. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=204)   I see Shinzi over at his usual booth. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=206)   He owns the place. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=208)   You can tell his booth by the charts and graphs. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=212)   Yeah, he's a geek and into Zen mathematics, but don't let the glasses fool you. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=220)   He may be able to say Samadhi in a dozen languages, but he can get your sunscapes flowing better 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=227)   than nasal spray. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=231)   He reportedly has a bank account with the big guy with more zeros than you want to know 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=238)   about. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=241)   Upstairs there's also a Gawanka parlor. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=244)   They do piercings. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=246)   They start with the nose and are sometimes known to pierce through the whole body. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=252)   If you're into that kind of thing. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=255)   Back when Roshi owned the place, it was a Zen arcade. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=258)   A lot of parlor games, learning to clap with one hand, making faces like before you were 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=264)   born, that kind of thing. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=266)   There was a big flower in the corner, and if you could get inside of it and get out 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=271)   without anybody seeing you, you could get a ride on the complete experience, which is 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=279)   no ordinary ride. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=282)   Supposedly, it is the best thing that ever happens to you, except you can't remember 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=289)   a thing. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=291)   Yeah, the main Zen thing around here these days is the Merge With Us conference call, 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=298)   and you can practice the program at home. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=301)   Yeah, I guess you can now merge at local or long distance rates, but information is always 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=308)   free. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=311)   That noise? 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=313)   Some deconstruction happening up on the third floor. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=317)   The place is in pieces, but I hear they got rid of a lot of unnecessary crap that was 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=324)   just gumming up the works. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=326)   I hear the view's gonna be a lot better now. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=330)   Oh, it's almost time for the last show. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=333)   It's a good act. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=335)   A singer with a dress so tight, all you can see is expansion and contraction and some 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=343)   undulation. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=344)   Lots of good body sensations. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=349)   Her name is Melissa Mana. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=352)   Yeah, she's a bit self-absorbed, but she sings a good song. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=358)   Sometimes the show is solid, sometimes restful, but it always flows, and before you know it, 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=365)   it is over, gone, kaput. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=368)   I chill with the solid, hang with the restful, and go with the flow, and when it's over, 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=376)   nothing, nada, zero. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=379)   But that's how it goes. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=384)   Yeah, I'm going back to the bar for a second clarity cocktail before the show. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=390)   I wanna get a good seat. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=393)   It's been nice chatting with you. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=397)   Or have I been some internal talk and mental image taking you away from being here now? 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=408)   The only way for you to know for sure is to wake up. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV15DUut3XU&t=417)   Good luck with that. 
<br>
