title: "Focus Out with Fascination  ~Stephanie Nash"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=0)   So, two times ago, I focused on flow. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=22)   So what I had everybody do was tune into the moving, changing nature of everything with 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=29)   acceptance. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=30)   And it can be the moving, changing nature of anything visual, which could be we watch 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=35)   leaves moving and just tuned into the movement as opposed to that's a leaf, that's a branch. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=41)   And there might be different frequencies of movement. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=43)   The branch might move like this while the leaves move like this. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=46)   We just tune into that movement. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=48)   Let the movement be a visual massage. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=50)   I talked about how doing this driving around LA can be wonderful. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=55)   There's traffic, people, right? 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=57)   There's movement happening. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=58)   And you can just allow that. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=60)   And it doesn't keep you, you don't start driving into walls. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=63)   You're still present. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=65)   But it can create a kind of an acceptance and a massage in the visual field. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=69)   You can do it with sounds. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=71)   Sounds are just moving and coming and going and expanding and contracting. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=76)   You know, there can be just different movement of sounds. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=80)   And that's seeing and hearing out in the outside world. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=83)   Seeing hearing in, you can apply that movement of sound and they come and go to the talk 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=89)   in your head. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=90)   Oh, it's a sound coming and going and getting louder and softer. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=94)   It's just movement. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=95)   You can do it closing your eyes with images. 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=97)   When we see, we tend to, I have a blank place where we rest visually. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=102)   You just close your eyes and it might be just patches of lightness and darkness. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=105)   And for a lot of people, it's like a lava lamp. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=108)   It's got a glob here and it comes and goes. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=111)   You can just watch that movement of it and let that be a visual massage. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=114)   Or if images come in, for most people it's not like, hi, there's a square picture frame. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=119)   It's usually a vague, hazy, subtle thing or maybe part of an image comes and goes out 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=124)   or something reminds you of something. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=126)   And just let that movement of images coming in and out be a visual massage. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=131)   And in the body, you can work with sensations moving around. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=135)   Breath is an ultimate movement to come in and go out. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=139)   There's how many different kinds of breath meditation I personally have taught, I don't 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=143)   know, 10, 12 different ways of looking at the breath. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=145)   But one way I did was just noticing the movement, the expanding, the contracting, maybe the 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=150)   movement of air coming through the nose, maybe emotions coming in and out. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=155)   A sound happens and ooh, you know, birds happen and I feel a little movement of delight in 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=160)   my body or a dog barks and I feel, oh, maybe a little tension and release there or something. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=166)   So that we just turn into the movement nature and everybody thought, oh, that's cool, that's 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=171)   fun. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=172)   And it makes us softer and I feel like I've really meditated, you know. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=176)   Then the next week I went, okay, now we're going to look at stillness. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=179)   We're going to look at space and rest. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=182)   I tuned everyone into the same visual thing when you close your eyes. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=189)   Kind of focusing on movement, even though movement's there, you're not watching movement. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=193)   It's a place to park. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=196)   We even worked with just a sense of space around you, a space around things to allow 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=202)   things to happen inside a bigger space. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=205)   The real thing that was an eye opener for a lot of people was auditory, listening to 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=210)   silence even though sound is present. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=213)   So we open out to the world of sound and there might be sound there, sound there, but what 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=218)   if we listen in a direction there is no sound? 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=220)   Ah, tuning into that space and then maybe even listening to the silence beyond sound. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=227)   Ah, huge space, very expansive focus and everybody felt like, oh, we've really meditated now. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=233)   You know, that's different. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=234)   That's different than how we get through life. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=236)   So we had one week of flow and then one week of rest and space. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=241)   So today I thought, let's celebrate solidity. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=247)   And this is also, if you've got emails, I ended up putting it as the theme. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=252)   You've heard of the power of now, right? 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=254)   Let's be present. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=255)   Well, there's a way to tune in to see and you'll notice everything I do is visual, auditory, 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=262)   somatic. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=263)   We have five senses plus our thought process. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=267)   Our five senses plus our thought process are what tell us who we are, when, where, why, 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=273)   how we feel about it, what we want to do, what happened and whether that was good or 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=276)   bad and what all our judgments are and all our suffering comes in in these five senses 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=285)   plus our thought process. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=287)   And you could say thoughts and feelings, but the feelings will be in the body. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=293)   And you can divide all of that into three because I like three. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=297)   Trinity is also one of the things about three. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=300)   My meditation teacher, Shinzen Young, came up with this though. 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=303)   It's his brilliance and his ingredients I cook with and send always appreciation and 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=309)   gratitude to teachers, always, always, always. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=312)   I come from teachers and thank you. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=317)   But he divides it all into visual, auditory, somatic. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=320)   So your entire sensory experience, your thoughts, visual, I see images, I hear internal talk. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=327)   So there's visual, auditory to thoughts. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=330)   Things are in the body and there might be a thought component, but that's visual. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=333)   So see, hear, feel. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=335)   We either see out the world, we see into our mind. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=338)   We hear out the sounds, we hear in to the talk. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=342)   Feel out and feel in. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=344)   Feel in will be emotions. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=346)   Then we're doing subjective versus objective. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=349)   Subjective would be emotional sensations. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=351)   I have fear in my chest. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=354)   You know when you want to cry sometimes and you try to choke it down, the tongue kind 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=357)   of gets engaged here and we've even got terms like cat got my tongue and I got a lump in 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=361)   my throat. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=362)   I was all choked up. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=363)   You know, and it gets, or teary feeling behind the eyes or a wave of love, of warmth we might 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=369)   feel in the chest. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=370)   Or you get embarrassed, there might be a flush you feel up in your face. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=374)   Usually it's the front part of the torso, maybe into the face, but some people get anger 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=378)   down the back of their neck, right? 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=379)   The hair stood up on the back of my neck. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=381)   We've got that phrase. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=382)   It broke my heart, right? 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=384)   We have all sorts of ways in which emotions play in the body and we don't, we might say 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=390)   my heart or I couldn't stomach that or you know, we'll point to parts of the body, but 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=395)   it's usually kind of, it, they're vague. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=399)   It's kind of another dimension of feeling in the body. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=401)   We can't say that was this organ. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=404)   It kind of spreads and takes a certain area of the body and it's a kind of sensation just 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=410)   like earlier today in the meditation. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=413)   I had you tune into a particular flavor sensation. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=417)   The flavor or flavors of letting go release. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=420)   There are other sensations. 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=422)   You could still feel your butt on the cushion, but we were tuning into letting go. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=426)   While in the same way, feel in are certain sensations that are emotional in nature. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=432)   And if you're not sure, say they're not. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=435)   But if you think they are, if you think, ah, every time I go, damn it, why did he do that? 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=442)   And I feel this clench in here. 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=443)   We'll call that emotional in nature. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=445)   Okay. 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=446)   And so you start to get to know where anger happens in your body, where fear, anger, fear, 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=452)   sadness, shame. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=453)   Those are the big four. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=456)   People suffer and kill themselves over those all the time. 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=459)   So and then we have good ones, love, joy, peace, gratitude, and they tend to be subtler. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=464)   The louder ones tend to, hey, I'm here, but just like restful that we tuned into, that's 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=470)   a subtle thing that's available at any given moment. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=473)   But no, I'm not tuning into that. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=475)   I'm tuning into that guy cut me off, you know, or the talk, right? 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=481)   So you can, as a choice, learn to tune into these subtle. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=484)   It's like tuning in a fainter radio station, but after a while, it's not so subtle. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=489)   The more you tune into it, the bigger it gets. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=492)   You know that way. 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=493)   You literally develop new neural pathways in the brain. 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=497)   I grew up in the woods, so I talk about taking a path in the woods, and I didn't like taking 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=502)   the regular trail. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=503)   I'd always like to take a different trail. 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=505)   That to me was fun. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=506)   I used to try to get lost. 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=507)   I thought that was so exciting. 
<br>[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=508)   That moment when I'm like, I don't know where I am, because I grew up in a small town where 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=512)   everyone knew you since you were born and just anything unknown was thrilling. 
<br>[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=516)   And I do a new path, and then pretty soon I take that new path every day, and that's 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=520)   my path, and all the animals would take that path, and then pretty soon the old one grows 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=524)   over, right? 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=526)   And then pretty soon that's the main path. 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=527)   Well, now I've got to try another one. 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=529)   But I've talked with neurologists and brain researchers, and at Harvard, even the guys 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=538)   who studied my brain when I was there, and they say what I describe as those paths in 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=544)   the woods, I'm telling people that's a way to create new paths, and they have told me 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=548)   that is exactly what happens in your brain. 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=551)   That every time you have that thought, and this happens, oh, the brain goes, there's 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=556)   a pathway. 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=557)   So the next time that thought happens, there's a higher probability you're going to have 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=561)   that same response because it knows that path. 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=564)   Not because that was the best one, not because that's the one that feels good. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=569)   And then we have a tendency to associate familiar with what we like, and those are two different 
<br>[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=576)   things. 
<br>[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=577)   And I learned that real big at Duke when we worked with battered housewives who would 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=581)   rather get hit than go to something they didn't know. 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=583)   And they even sometimes let their children get hit rather than go to something they didn't 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=588)   know because there was a life or death fear of leaving that isn't rational. 
<br>[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=595)   It has to do with us associating familiar with good. 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=601)   So in that way today, I'm going to be having you, now you're going, oh, this is going to 
<br>[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=608)   be scary. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=609)   So today I'm going to have you tune into something you do all the time. 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=612)   See here, feel out. 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=613)   Sight, you see all the time. 
<br>[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=614)   Hear, you hear sounds all the time. 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=615)   Feel in the body, oh, I didn't do feel out in the body. 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=621)   Feel in where emotions, feel out is every other sensation. 
<br>[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=625)   Every objective sensation that is not emotional. 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=628)   But on the cushion is feel out. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=630)   Feel your tongue in your mouth, that's feel out. 
<br>[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=633)   It's objective. 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=634)   There's no drama. 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=638)   There's no emotion in it. 
<br>[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=639)   The breath is one of the reasons we use breath in meditation. 
<br>[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=646)   For some people, 30% of people, when you say focus on your breath, they attempt to control 
<br>[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=650)   it. 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=651)   They can't not. 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=652)   And so it's an unpleasant experience for them. 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=654)   But people who teach breath meditation don't always factor that. 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=658)   That can be an issue. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=659)   But you feel your hands. 
<br>[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=661)   You can feel your feet on the floor, clothes on your skin, temperature, humidity of air 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=666)   on your skin. 
<br>[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=667)   There's lots of touch sensations that are not emotional in nature that would be feel 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=672)   out. 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=673)   So today, to be here now, our dramas tend to be where? 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=679)   See and hear and feel in, right? 
<br>[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=681)   Thoughts and feelings. 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=682)   Ah, I remember that. 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=685)   This happened and I play it over and over again. 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=688)   We replay our traumas. 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=689)   We traumatize ourself over and over again, right? 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=694)   Where's a safe place to go? 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=695)   Well, we can go to our happy flow place. 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=697)   We did that. 
<br>[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=698)   We can go to our happy rest place. 
<br>[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=699)   Everybody wants to go to a happy place. 
<br>[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=702)   We can actually ground ourselves in the truth and the reality of allowing all of our attention 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=710)   to soak into, penetrate, explore what we're seeing. 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=719)   Now see, hear, feel. 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=722)   We do it all the time. 
<br>[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=723)   But what we tend to do is see and hear in general. 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=729)   We tend to let it all be one thing. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=733)   We don't tend to separate out see from hear from feel. 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=738)   It's just all this stuff happening. 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=740)   And we tend to be drawn to an arising, pleasant or unpleasant, a loud sound. 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=747)   And that the only time we separate hear from see would be like music, art, and seeing the 
<br>[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=757)   art. 
<br>[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=758)   We'll let the art feel it. 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=759)   But then we'll have an emotional sensation to the art or something else. 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=762)   But we're not separating necessarily, deliberately separating the see out from it. 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=768)   In fact, the internal talk may be going wild while we're seeing the art. 
<br>[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=772)   What does he mean? 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=774)   But to just focus in on the see, just focus in on the hear, just focus in on the feel. 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=783)   Now when you do this, especially with see out, hear out, feel out, it doesn't mean that 
<br>[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=791)   if I'm just focusing on the see, I have stopped feeling and I have no ability to hear or sounds 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=797)   have all stopped. 
<br>[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=798)   It doesn't mean that at all. 
<br>[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=800)   It means I am selectively attending. 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=804)   I have so much real estate in my consciousness and I am filling it, choosing meditation, 
<br>[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=810)   I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the rest of my body. 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=815)   I'm choosing to fill my awareness with the visual experience. 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=820)   So it's a choice to do it and at first it may seem effortful. 
<br>[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=831)   Well normally I just see and hear and feel. 
<br>[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=834)   You're making me just go there and just go there and just go there. 
<br>[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=840)   Or you might say, I have trouble concentrating. 
<br>[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=843)   I want to develop my concentration. 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=846)   Well my answer to that, this is my yellow brick road, is fascination. 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=852)   I guided, I think the week before last week, I think I did a 45 minute meditation on flow. 
<br>[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=859)   I think I was. 
<br>[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=860)   And last week was probably 35. 
<br>[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=861)   But I did a 45 minute meditation. 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=862)   And everyone went, I didn't think that was 45 minutes. 
<br>[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=863)   I was like, 20 minutes. 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=864)   And I said, okay, because that means you were in a state of high concentration. 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=873)   What's that mean? 
<br>[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=874)   It means you were there and you weren't wandering off somewhere. 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=878)   You were there. 
<br>[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=881)   Why were you there? 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=883)   Well I happen to think it's fascinating. 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=886)   So I share that fascination. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=888)   It's like the fascination and I always say like a four year old with a ladybug. 
<br>[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=893)   You know, we're four that can't, in fact you cannot take a three or four year old and walk 
<br>[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=897)   across, if this room were grass and a grass yard, you couldn't go from there to here in 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=903)   five minutes with a three or four year old because there'd just be too many interesting 
<br>[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=907)   things to see. 
<br>[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=908)   Whoa, look at that. 
<br>[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=909)   That is so cool. 
<br>[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=910)   Look at that ladybug. 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=911)   It just opened its wings. 
<br>[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=912)   Oh my goodness. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=913)   And I work with people in chronic and acute pain. 
<br>[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=914)   You can look at your pain that way. 
<br>[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=915)   You can look at your emotions. 
<br>[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=916)   Oh my God, I have terror here. 
<br>[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=917)   Okay, where do you feel it? 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=918)   Where are the boundaries? 
<br>[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=919)   Is there movement? 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=920)   Is it the same in the middle or in the outside? 
<br>[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=921)   No one's ever asked anybody these questions. 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=922)   I don't know. 
<br>[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=923)   Well, maybe. 
<br>[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=924)   Actually, I think it's a good question. 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=925)   I think it's a good question. 
<br>[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=926)   I think it's a good question. 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=927)   I think it's a good question. 
<br>[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=928)   I think it's a good question. 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=929)   I think it's a good question. 
<br>[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=936)   When you start exploring it, it is friggin' fascinating. 
<br>[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=940)   And guess what? 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=941)   The suffering's gone. 
<br>[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=943)   You're watching the pain. 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=946)   Usually as soon as we start watching it and stuff, often it turns into an energy. 
<br>[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=950)   It often presents its flow nature. 
<br>[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=952)   And pretty soon the suffering's gone. 
<br>[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=954)   But fascination, this childlike fascination to explore with curiosity, with kind of an 
<br>[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=962)   openness, that to me isn't where we're going. 
<br>[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=967)   That's the yellow brick road to getting there. 
<br>[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=970)   And so people who say, I can't concentrate, that fascination creates concentration. 
<br>[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=976)   Because everybody who did that 45 minutes wasn't able to sit at home for 45 minutes 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=980)   without their attention wandering. 
<br>[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=982)   They were fascinated. 
<br>[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=983)   They were interested. 
<br>[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=985)   It rivets your attention. 
<br>[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=986)   When you're doing something you really like, you go at it and hours go by and you're not 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=991)   aware of it, right? 
<br>[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=993)   You like it. 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=994)   So I say, get fascinated. 
<br>[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=996)   You can practice getting fascinated. 
<br>[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1000)   That 45 minute meditation, some people went, oh my goodness, I had no idea there was this 
<br>[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1006)   and they went there and then this. 
<br>[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1009)   Or last week with the rest, the whole notion of tuning into silence, even though sound 
<br>[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1014)   was there, was like wow to people. 
<br>[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1016)   And then we went there and then, so we filled one 45 minute meditation with all these things 
<br>[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1022)   to explore and another just with flow. 
<br>[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1026)   And then another 35 minute meditation filled with just places to rest and park and space. 
<br>[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1033)   Every single moment of all those meditations is available in every moment. 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1041)   Every friggin' moment of your sensory experience is friggin' fascinating. 
<br>[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1046)   There's so much to soak into. 
<br>[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1049)   You just got to shift to that four year old and what I'm trying to supply is saying, it's 
<br>[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1056)   like saying, have you ever wiggled your ear or a little tone? 
<br>[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1058)   No one ever tried it. 
<br>[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1060)   No one ever said, have you ever done that? 
<br>[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1063)   It wasn't until my meditation teacher said, well what if you just look at that? 
<br>[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1068)   What if you separate this experience? 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1069)   It didn't occur to me to separate it. 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1071)   I thought my emotions were part of the experience and I thought what I thought was the truth. 
<br>[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1077)   I thought that voice in the head was me. 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1080)   I thought that was my narration of my life. 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1084)   The idea that the voice in my head wasn't me, I was just like, whoa. 
<br>[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1089)   It's not who's driving the car, it's what's on the radio and I can turn it down or turn 
<br>[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1096)   it off or change the channel or if the knob is stuck I can just treat it as background 
<br>[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1101)   sound like the water or traffic or birds. 
<br>[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1106)   Never occurred to me. 
<br>[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1107)   So I was lucky to get a teacher to say, hey look, here's some other ways you can tune 
<br>[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1114)   into that. 
<br>[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1115)   That kind of makes life better, doesn't it? 
<br>[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1118)   All this richness. 
<br>[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1120)   And the question I get, and this was just on the YouTube video I put up, I had to re-watch 
<br>[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1125)   myself. 
<br>[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1126)   But some people go, doesn't that take away the beauty? 
<br>[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1132)   You know, you're looking at these ingredients and you're missing that whole beauty of it. 
<br>[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1141)   Doesn't that kind of take it away? 
<br>[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1144)   You're getting kind of technical here. 
<br>[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1147)   No. 
<br>[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1149)   If all those ingredients are available in every given moment, do you see the richness 
<br>[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1156)   and depth that's there? 
<br>[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1159)   You start to realize that what we've been looking at is a cartoon versus what's real. 
<br>[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1166)   What's really there is so much more interesting and fulfilling than what we've been accepting 
<br>[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1172)   as. 
<br>[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1173)   Of course that's what I think and that's what's there. 
<br>[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1177)   What's there is what should be there. 
<br>[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1180)   Or what could be there. 
<br>[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1181)   Or what I'm afraid is there. 
<br>[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1184)   So I know one teacher always says, you know your thoughts aren't real, right? 
<br>[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1190)   And I just kind of like that. 
<br>[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1193)   Because we go, what are you trying to say? 
<br>[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1198)   But today we're going to work with, so if you're tangled up in thoughts and feelings, 
<br>[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1204)   we have a lot of ways to go. 
<br>[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1206)   You can watch them flow. 
<br>[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1208)   You can find a place to rest. 
<br>[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1210)   Or, and this is kind of what some Zen practice is, you can tune in to the grounded reality 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1218)   of the present moment of see, hear, feel. 
<br>[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1222)   And this, I have a lot of clients who are psychologists and psychiatrists in the psychology 
<br>[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1229)   field. 
<br>[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1230)   There's lots of isms and ists in there. 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1233)   And we've communicated back and forth a lot about using mindfulness practice and stuff 
<br>[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1242)   with patients. 
<br>[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1243)   And I've mentioned this in here before, but there was, the person was trying to get a 
<br>[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1250)   woman to tune into her body in a restful way. 
<br>[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1253)   And this woman had been sexually traumatized and abused. 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1258)   And so just going in the body at all was just danger, danger. 
<br>[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1262)   Will Robinson can't go in the body. 
<br>[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1265)   She just doesn't have, she just hasn't developed the skill yet to work with, there was so much 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1271)   there. 
<br>[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1272)   So we said, what if we went out to sound? 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1277)   So she went out and worked with sound and insight, didn't even do the body at all, and 
<br>[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1282)   developed this equanimity with it. 
<br>[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1284)   And then developed the mindfulness skills there that then when we could come back to 
<br>[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1288)   the body, she'd already had those muscles, those mindfulness muscles developed of clarity 
<br>[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1293)   and equanimity and focus. 
<br>[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1296)   So that when she came to the body, she didn't get, you know, if stuff came up, she had skills 
<br>[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1302)   for saying, ah, this is this, this is this. 
<br>[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1306)   And I can, I can see and work with this skillfully to then rewire the brain so that we're not 
<br>[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1312)   re-traumatizing every time. 
<br>[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1314)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1316)   And sound is here now. 
<br>[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1318)   So what we hear at this moment is happening in this moment, and we don't really have a 
<br>[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1322)   drama about it. 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1323)   It's not related to our personal issues. 
<br>[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1326)   So if at any moment you're going, oh my God, this is going on, or I can't keep doing this. 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1333)   Okay, that's coming in as internal talk. 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1335)   That's hearing in. 
<br>[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1338)   Wherever your distraction is, you can use your distraction to take you more deeply into 
<br>[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1343)   your meditation. 
<br>[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1346)   How? 
<br>[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1350)   So if I'm hearing in, I can slide out on the auditory axis. 
<br>[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1355)   Hear in, slide. 
<br>[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1356)   Every time I go, my God, you know, that person is rude. 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1363)   Okay, hear out into sound. 
<br>[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1367)   You can think of it as some people went, oh, it's like an antidote. 
<br>[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1369)   And I go, yeah, but it's really, you're already hearing. 
<br>[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1373)   You're just sliding out and anchoring in the truth of this sound rather than the one you're 
<br>[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1380)   making up in your head. 
<br>[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1383)   And so when we hear sounds, sometimes we get images. 
<br>[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1388)   And there's a visual component to our thinking process that we're usually less aware of because 
<br>[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1392)   we walk around with our eyes open. 
<br>[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1395)   But we all get image with our eyes open. 
<br>[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1397)   And if you haven't done this with me before, I will demonstrate it. 
<br>[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1401)   So everyone look up here to the front of the room and see this lovely scarf and really 
<br>[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1406)   see all of, see she needs to iron that, see the texture of the wood and the light, and 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1411)   really, really see it. 
<br>[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1412)   Now look up in this direction and visualize your car, the inside of your car. 
<br>[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1417)   Okay, can you see the inside of your car? 
<br>[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1421)   Okay, see how your focus kind of went back to see the car and this is softer? 
<br>[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1424)   Now come forward and really see the texture here. 
<br>[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1429)   See that difference? 
<br>[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1430)   We do that thousands of times a day. 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1433)   We're not aware of it. 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1435)   We're going back and seeing it. 
<br>[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1436)   Every time you get a thought, oh, I'm going to go to the grocery store, you're going to 
<br>[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1438)   see a grocery store. 
<br>[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1440)   He said that you're going to see his face. 
<br>[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1442)   You're going to go back and forth like that all day long. 
<br>[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1445)   So today we're going to be working with that, see this. 
<br>[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1448)   If you find yourself going back, because we're going to have eyes open at one point, if you 
<br>[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1452)   find yourself going into things, ground in this and really go up. 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1458)   Look for texture. 
<br>[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1459)   That's the fascination. 
<br>[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1461)   Look for texture. 
<br>[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1462)   Every time you look, try to see something different you didn't see before. 
<br>[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1467)   Like the kid with the ladybug or walking across the grass. 
<br>[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1470)   That make sense? 
<br>[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1471)   Cool. 
<br>[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2lAUERZvWo&t=1472)   That's what we're going to do. 
<br>
