title: "How Shinzen Broke Through an Addiction"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=0)   There's one other experience that was very dramatic. When I did my first retreat in the 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=12)   U Ba Khin method, which is body sweeping, at that time I'd had a ten year very intense 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=20)   addiction to marijuana, but they won't let you use substances, which is fine. I obeyed 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=28)   that. I was sweeping through my body and I noticed this very subtle little discomfort 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=34)   around my lungs and whatever. No big deal, but I knew it was sort of associated with 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=39)   maybe all the smoke I was putting in there. But nothing intense, no thoughts about it 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=45)   or whatever. When I came back from that retreat, apparently the part of my body that was enjoying 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=53)   the marijuana and the part of my body that was being damaged by the marijuana communicated 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=58)   below the threshold of awareness because I had sort of clarified the body for the body. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=66)   It had nothing to do with my mind whatsoever. But when I went home, that addiction disappeared 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=75)   spontaneously and never came back. That was very impressive. It's like, wow. I didn't 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=84)   have to struggle. There was no on the wagon, off the wagon kind of stuff of struggling 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=88)   with it. It was gone. My body had decided. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=94)   Was this before or after the No Boundaries? 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=100)   After. The No Boundaries doesn't guarantee that your bad habits go away. You spend the 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=106)   rest of your life refining yourself. So I would say, yeah, those four over a period 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=112)   of 40 years, that's like one per decade. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7A5kAESTQ&t=115)   Those are good ones though. I take one of those every 10 years.
