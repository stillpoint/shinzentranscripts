<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=0)   Now, slow down the label just slightly to give yourself more time to sort of soak your 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=13)   awareness into that secondary sensation. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=21)   And if there's no secondary sensation, if all the secondaries disappear, you can use 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=26)   the label nowhere. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=30)   But if you're drawn to, say, your whole body, like it seems to spread through your whole 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=35)   body and you're aware of that, then you can use the label whole body. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=50)   And that's a good suggestion. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=66)   What was happening during the silence there? 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=95)   Were you focusing in the same location? 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=100)   It felt like whole body, but it wasn't enough to say it. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=105)   Just subtly the whole body? 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=107)   Subtly the whole body. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=108)   Subtle is significant. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=109)   Definitely if there's a hint of whole body, say whole body. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=113)   And just open up the whole body to it. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=117)   So, if you... 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=119)   And guessing and groping is okay, by the way. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=122)   It's perfectly okay to make a guess. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=125)   Any questions so far? 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=127)   It's whole body now. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=129)   It's a lot of whole body? 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=130)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=131)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=132)   It may be always whole body. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=133)   That's actually... 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=134)   Does it seem like it wants to do that? 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=136)   Yes. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=137)   When you say whole body, you zoom out and cover the spread. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=141)   You know how if you... 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=147)   You have a local pressure and then you let it spread out. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=152)   That will relieve the pressure. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=154)   If you let those secondary sensations spread over your whole body, 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=158)   you may find that that dissipates some of the pressure from the local intensity 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=163)   after enough time. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=165)   That's the purpose for opening up to the possibility that it spreads over the whole body. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=171)   So, once again, that's excellent spatial resolution. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=176)   By resolution, I mean ability to be clear about what you're detecting. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=182)   So, if it seems to be whole body and it's over and over again, 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=186)   whole body, just zoom your attention out, cover the whole body, 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=190)   and just let the sensation ripple and radiate out into space 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=195)   in all six directions out from your body. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=198)   Does that instruction make sense? 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=200)   Yes, it does. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=201)   Excellent. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=202)   So, now I'd like you to continue using the spoken labels. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=205)   Again, I'll just be doing my own practice while you do that. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=214)   Hips. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=222)   Forearms. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=233)   Ankles. 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=245)   Whole body. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=250)   That's perfect. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=252)   By that I mean the tone of voice, the pacing, and the wording are all perfect. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=259)   Once you establish this awareness, the rest is just a matter of time. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=266)   The tone of voice indicates that you have a quality that we call equanimity. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=272)   The pacing of the labels guarantees that you're highly concentrated. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=278)   And the wording of the labels guarantees that you're bringing sensory clarity to the experience. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=284)   In this case, the sensory clarity is the precision with regards to the location of the secondary spread sensations. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=293)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=295)   Yes. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=296)   How what you're doing develops those three qualities? 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=299)   Once you have a momentum of those qualities, then it's just a numbers game. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=306)   You are setting the stage for nature to break up the suffering from this experience. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=318)   It could happen in five minutes or it could take five months, depending on the depth of the challenge. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=326)   You can tell by the way that you're labeling that you have a momentum of concentration, clarity, and equanimity. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=336)   Once you establish that momentum, then the rest is just keeping it up and letting time pass. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=342)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=343)   Yes, it does. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=344)   Excellent. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=345)   Now, I'd like you to continue to do that. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=348)   Once again, I'm just going to do my own practice for a few minutes. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=351)   We're going to give nature a chance, give some time for it. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=356)   Any questions about what we've done so far? 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=359)   No. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=360)   It makes perfect sense? 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=361)   It makes perfect sense. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=362)   Excellent. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=363)   I'll pause for a minute and then I'll touch base with you again in a couple of minutes. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=393)   Rise. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=424)   You can label a little bit more quickly, just a bit more. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=429)   That will help with concentration a little bit. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=435)   You can repeat the same label again. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=441)   Ankles. Feet. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miX52Exkkqk&t=464)   Whole body. 
<br>
