title: "What is Love at the Deepest Level? ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=0)   What should we do to make this world a better place? 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=20)   People often ask me, there's this circumstance or that condition in the world. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=33)   I find myself saying, I can't help people with the specifics. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=40)   I don't know the specifics of politics or how things should work in the world, but I 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=48)   do know some general principles that I think hold in all cases. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=58)   The way I sum it up is the phrase that I used at the end of the last talk, which is, love 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=66)   deeply and act effectively. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=71)   Acting effectively is related to your mindfulness skills and strategies, but that's not the 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=86)   whole picture of acting effectively. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=89)   Acting effectively involves a lot of things, but mindfulness skills and strategies do enter 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=97)   in. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=101)   Loving deeply critically depends on mindfulness skills and techniques. 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=120)   We always are asking, what is love? 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=132)   We're always seeking something. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=141)   It's taken me decades to have a confident answer with regards to the question, what 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=150)   is love at a very deep level. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=155)   I don't think I can confidently answer it at more superficial levels. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=160)   That would be other kinds of experts would talk about that. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=165)   But I do have a confident answer as to what it is at a very deep level, maybe the deepest 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=173)   level. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=177)   We chant this mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, hail to the jewel in the lotus. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=187)   If you think of love as this fragrant, colorful, attractive flower, is there in the center 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=203)   of it something that is its essence that could be called the jewel that's hidden inside that 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=212)   lotus? 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=213)   I would say yes. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=217)   I would say that I can put it into words. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=224)   I am also tempted not to put it into words because the words are likely to be a letdown 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=234)   until there's an experience that goes with those words. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=243)   The description is sort of not all that poetic. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=262)   How do we know that there's a world? 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=266)   Well, we see it, we hear it, we touch it, and we think about it. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=274)   Of course, when we think about it, we see it, we hear comments about it, we have words 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=282)   about it, we have emotional sensations. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=286)   So through inner and outer activity, we have the perception that there is a world. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=297)   And through those same sense gates, we have the perception that we have a self. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=306)   So as your mindfulness skills develop, it becomes possible to have a more and more complete 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=321)   experience of inner and outer seer field. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=327)   That means an experience with progressively greater sensory richness, but also progressively 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=336)   less moment-by-moment fixation. 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=339)   That leads to a paradoxical experience, which is an experience of maximal richness, because 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=352)   it's getting richer and richer and richer, but at the same time, minimal somethingness, 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=360)   because the amount of time that you're fixating any particular part of it is getting shorter 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=365)   and shorter and shorter. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=368)   So at the limit of clarity and equanimity is the experience that is optimally rich and 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=387)   also utterly vacuous at the same time. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=393)   And can you put into words what that's like? 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=397)   Sure, but as I say, it's likely to be a bit of a letdown. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=403)   What it's like is that there is an absolute rest, wherein time and space collapse to a 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=419)   dimensionless point that has no position. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=425)   And then that breaks apart, and the positive spreads and the negative pulls in. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=436)   There's a simultaneous expansion and contraction like a space fountain that's spreading and 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=443)   collapsing. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=444)   It's the fountain of youth. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=447)   It's the Ponce de Leon, it's gushing and gathering, and it's shimmering, vibrant space. 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=459)   And if you stay with that, you have everything you ever wanted, and you have absolute safety. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=476)   You're being held by your cosmic parents. 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=481)   Your physical parents would have been a representation of this cosmic parenting. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=496)   But most people don't notice that, even though it happens thousands of times a day. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=504)   Each time they see the world, or themselves, or hear, or touch, or think, or move, or speak, 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=518)   just before this happens. 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=523)   So people don't notice it, number one. 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=526)   And number two, that scintillating mist coagulates into inner and outer seer field, and there's 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=540)   a sense of an I that is vulnerable and disconsolate, not getting what it wants. 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=557)   And there's a sense of an it that is fundamentally alien and threatening, called the world or 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=570)   the other. 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=575)   So the jewel in the lotus, when you unfold the petals and look at what's on the inside, 
<br>[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=592)   when we say we're experiencing human love, be it of the physical kind or any other kind, 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=602)   but it's the human love. 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=603)   Well, the human love is that flower, and certainly that has its place in the nature of things. 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=615)   But it's also important to have a deeper context whereby you understand this non-human love 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=629)   that is hidden within, always was, and is available all the time. 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=640)   So to love deeply means that before that you are aware that love always comes first. 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=666)   You can't have any reaction of any sort whatsoever without first having a perception of yourself 
<br>[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=680)   and the world, except at the origin of each perception of self and world is this, this 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=691)   deep love. 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=693)   So if you come in contact with this, that means that all of the decisions, the judgments, 
<br>[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=704)   the reactions, they're still going to happen like they always do. 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=710)   But there is an inescapable context that proceeds. 
<br>[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=717)   So that then colors your responses. 
<br>[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=725)   It doesn't mean that you no longer judge or that you can't take action or that you can't 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=734)   confront or oppose. 
<br>[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=739)   It doesn't militate against any of that, but it just puts it in a different context. 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=749)   So let's say that there's something going on in the world that you think is bad and 
<br>[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=758)   action needs to be taken to change this, certainly legitimate. 
<br>[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=772)   If you're able to love deeply, that's going to have a huge effect on acting effectively. 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=783)   Unfortunately, the bad news is most humans have not yet learned how to love deeply. 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=796)   So because loving deeply means hundreds of times in the day, whenever you perceive the 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=804)   other, the enemy, the source of the problem, them, it, whenever you perceive that, you 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=816)   first perceive that being loved into existence by the source, whether you perceive it by 
<br>[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=825)   sight, sound, touch, or whether you perceive it by thinking about it. 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=830)   I mentioned the Pratyahaparamita literature, Manjushri. 
<br>[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=836)   There's the wisdom function and then there's the wisdom writings. 
<br>[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=841)   So in the temples, at least in the temple where I lived in Japan, at Koyasan, there 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=848)   was a custom of, they celebrate New Year's a little differently than here. 
<br>[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=857)   So what you do is you stay up all night, like here, on New Year's Eve, but you read the 
<br>[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=866)   entire 20,000 verses of the Pratyahaparamita, or at least as much of it as you can get through. 
<br>[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=876)   You chant it in Sino-Japanese. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=880)   So I think I mentioned that it's like an encyclopedia Britannica. 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=886)   It's just got all this detail of information about the world of India 2,000 years ago approximately 
<br>[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=898)   translated into Chinese. 
<br>[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=902)   So it just lists all this stuff and then it says this is empty, that's empty. 
<br>[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=909)   It's got all the cultural information, the crazy ideas they had about geography, etc., 
<br>[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=919)   etc. 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=922)   And then it says this is empty, this is empty, this is empty. 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=927)   And you might wonder, well, what's the point? 
<br>[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=932)   But one night on New Year's, when we were doing that, we were chanting all night. 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=942)   You have to look at the book, right, because no one can memorize so much. 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=946)   So you're actually reading it. 
<br>[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=949)   So you're seeing what the text says. 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=956)   I realized that what this was all about, why we were doing that. 
<br>[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=964)   Because, well, let's see. 
<br>[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=968)   Do you know the, did you ever hear Allen Ginsberg's parody of the Pratyahaparamita? 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=980)   I don't know if it was written down or if he just performed it, but it was something 
<br>[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=988)   to the effect of shit is empty, piss is empty, fuck is empty, screw is empty. 
<br>[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=997)   Something along those lines. 
<br>[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1000)   Yeah, really, you'll probably find it on the internet. 
<br>[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1005)   So I just said a bunch of four-letter words, but when you, if I say, you know, houses are 
<br>[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1018)   empty, apartments are empty, parks are empty, if you're really watching image space, you'll 
<br>[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1027)   see that you get what in Sanskrit is called spota, S-P-O-T-A, S-P-H-O-T-A, spota. 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1038)   What a spota is, is a little flicker of an image that's very, very fleeting. 
<br>[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1048)   So when you're reading, you know, this is empty, this is empty, every one of those thises, 
<br>[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1056)   I started to notice created a momentary mental image. 
<br>[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1060)   How else would I know what it means, right? 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1064)   And then I started to tune into that and I could see the images, each one of those images 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1071)   born in between expansion and contraction, coming from and returning to empty. 
<br>[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1077)   It's a whole meditation. 
<br>[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1082)   You're thinking about the world, how do you think about the world? 
<br>[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1086)   Do you actually, are you actually aware that each one of those bursts of image and talk 
<br>[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1095)   come from and return to the source? 
<br>[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1101)   So once you sort of realize that, you'll be able to understand the early 21st century 
<br>[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1117)   North American Sutra, which goes like this, Trump is empty, Obama is empty, Trump is empty, 
<br>[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd7_bNI9u1E&t=1127)   Obama is empty, as many times as you need to hear that. 
<br>
