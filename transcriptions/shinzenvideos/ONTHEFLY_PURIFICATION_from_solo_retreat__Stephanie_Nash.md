<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=0)   It's an interesting practice to use when noticing internal talk. Whenever there's 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=7)   internal talk and I notice it, I stop and notice what tension in the head or body 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=12)   has happened because of that internal talk. Then I relax and release that. And 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=17)   if there was an emotion with internal talk, I might find that and really like 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=25)   feel it fully and then kind of open to it and release it in a certain kind of 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=31)   way. And then that affects how strong the next talk on that topic comes, if that 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=36)   makes sense. That's my on-the-fly purification process. This is my last 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=43)   organic night here, I guess I'll say. Tomorrow night will be a closing 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=49)   ceremony, so I'm just reflecting on the insights I've gotten and I feel 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZelaVxAXQ&t=56)   gratitude for the view.
