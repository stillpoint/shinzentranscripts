<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=0)   Meditation and the Other 
<br>[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=5)   The way you teach meditation is different than how other people teach. 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=11)   Right now, you've said things that I've not heard from other teachers 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=14)   about focusing on all these different places. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=17)   I've heard people talk about focusing on the breath 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=20)   and a few things that I said before, 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=22)   but you've now brought up all these different objects of meditation. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=25)   Is that how what you teach is different than what others teach? 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=29)   If I were to describe... 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=31)   I think first I'd want to emphasize how what I teach 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=34)   is similar to what the other people teach. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=38)   But of course, there's lumpers and there's splitters, right? 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=42)   The world is expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=44)   Am I asking you to split or lump? 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=46)   Well, you asked me to split, 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=48)   but I would prefer to initially lump, and then I'll split. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=54)   So I would say that... 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=61)   Well, I teach people to elevate their base level of concentration. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=65)   So from that perspective, 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=68)   I would be identical to any other competent meditation teacher. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=74)   I work within the mindfulness tradition. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=77)   Mindfulness can be called a kind of meditation, if you want to, 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=82)   in that one of the things that it does 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=85)   is dramatically elevate your base level of concentration. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=89)   But mindfulness has two other components. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=92)   Mindful awareness has... 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=94)   I think of mindful awareness as a threefold attentional skill set. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=101)   So one of the components we've already talked about at some length, 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=105)   that's your base level of concentration power, 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=108)   which I define as the ability to focus on what is deemed relevant at any given moment. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=115)   However, in addition to that, 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=117)   which any form of meditation, mindful meditation, 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=122)   or Christian Centering Prayer, or TM, 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=126)   they would all achieve that. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=128)   Mindfulness, in addition to that, 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=130)   has two other components or features 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=133)   that are strongly emphasized and are distinctive to it. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=138)   One I call sensory clarity, 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=141)   which you can think of as the ability to keep track 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=145)   of the components of your sensory experience. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=148)   For example, to make that tangible, 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=151)   when you're having an emotional experience, 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=155)   what part of that emotion is mental image? 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=159)   What part of that emotion is internal talk? 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=162)   And what part of that emotion is emotional feelings in your body? 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=168)   To keep track of the feel-image-talk components 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=173)   of emotion specifically and subjective experience in general, 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=179)   that would be an example of sensory clarity. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=182)   Or to know when you have an external sound. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=186)   The sound is one thing, 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=188)   but your feel-image-talk reactions to the sound are something else. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=193)   And it's those feel-image-talk reactions 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=196)   that create the sense of an eye listening to an it called the sound. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=201)   To be able to keep track of what part is sound, 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=204)   what part is my reaction, 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=206)   what part is sight, what part is my reaction. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=209)   Things like that are what I call sensory clarity. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=212)   And just as we give people exercises 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=215)   that specifically develop their concentration power, 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=219)   we also give people exercises that develop their sensory clarity. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=224)   So that's sort of distinctive to the mindfulness tradition. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=228)   Then another thing that's distinctive to the mindfulness tradition 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=231)   is a conscious development of what we call equanimity, 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=235)   which is a little bit of a strange word. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=237)   It's not ordinarily used. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=239)   And in fact, that's why we use it. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=242)   To be strange? 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=244)   Not to create an aura of mystical schmistical, 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=248)   but to give people a heads up, 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=250)   hey, this is a technical term, 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=252)   and it means something very specific, 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=254)   and it's defined in a certain way. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=257)   So equanimity sounds like being cooled out and detached, 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=261)   but actually, as we would define it in the mindfulness tradition, 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=265)   it's radical non-interference 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=269)   with the natural flow of sensory experience. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=272)   So if you have emotions in the body, 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=275)   you don't push them down, 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=277)   but you don't latch on to them inappropriately either. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=280)   It's a sort of non-pushing and pulling, 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=283)   a hands-off with regards to the flow of your senses, 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=287)   which does not for a moment imply a hands-off 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=290)   with regards to the flow of events in the world. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=293)   You can be very proactive and even pushy 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=297)   with regards to circumstances and conditions, 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=302)   but equanimity means that you're not pushing and pulling 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=306)   on the natural operation of your senses, 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=310)   your senses defined as external sight, external sound, 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=314)   physical type body sensations, 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=316)   your mental images, your internal talk, 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=319)   and your emotional body sensations. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=321)   You let touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk, 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=325)   expand and contract as they wish without interference. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=329)   Let me just make sure I get that right. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=331)   So equanimity is my experience, thoughts and feelings, 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=337)   and body sensation, 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=339)   and how I'm experiencing the world in terms of sight and sound. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=342)   I'm just letting that happen and watching that kind of flow, 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=347)   I don't know, like waves or something, 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=349)   but that's separate from my wanting to do an action in the world 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=354)   to change things. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=355)   Yes. In other words, as you become passive in a sense, 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=360)   with regards to, in the sense that you're passive 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=364)   in the sense that you don't fight yourself. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=367)   You train, another way to look at equanimity is 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=370)   it's training your sensory circuits not to interfere with themselves. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=375)   So you could compare it to, 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=378)   if your sensory experience is the engine of a car, 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=382)   equanimity is oiling the engine 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=385)   so the parts don't grind against each other. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=388)   And that's being in the Tao or that's that flow that we're going for? 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=393)   It can lead to an experience of fluidity, 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=397)   but sometimes it can lead to an experience of solidity 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=400)   because you're willing to let things melt and freeze. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=403)   There's another TS, this is going to be TS Eliot time, 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=406)   there's another TS Eliot line, 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=410)   midwinter spring is its own season, 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=414)   between melting and freezing the soul's sap quivers. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=419)   You have to be willing to melt and freeze. 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=423)   The equanimity is equanimity with whatever form the senses take. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=429)   But what equanimity does is, it's a skill. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=434)   Yeah, so it's, another way to look at it is 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=437)   it's learning to love every sensory experience as it arises, 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=444)   but not to hold on to it inappropriately as it passes. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=448)   How do you develop that skill? I'd like that one. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=451)   Everyone would, because... 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=454)   That's a good skill. Equanimity. Let's all have some equanimity. 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=459)   I concur. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=461)   And why it's a good skill is, 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=463)   you'll discover that when you have equanimity with pain, 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=466)   it still hurts, but it doesn't bother you. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=469)   And when you have equanimity with pleasure, 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=472)   it not only feels good, it satisfies you. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=476)   People think they want to be free from pain and to have pleasure, 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=480)   but what they really want is to be free from pain being a problem 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=484)   and to have pleasure that gives satisfaction. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=488)   And it turns out that the quality of equanimity does that. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=492)   So when you say, yeah, I'd like... 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=494)   It's like that joke, I'd like to have what she's having. 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=497)   What she's having, yeah, I've heard some of that. 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=499)   That's right. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=501)   The equanimity is definitely something. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=504)   And how do you... 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=506)   Desirable. Highly desirable. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=509)   In fact, more than desirable, maybe absolutely essential. 
<br>[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=514)   If you have some physical and or emotional pain 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=519)   that cannot be gotten rid of by changing circumstances or by analgesia 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=525)   or psychotropics or whatever, 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=529)   then you've got a choice of either developing equanimity 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=532)   or being mired in abject suffering. 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=537)   So definitely, equanimity is not only desirable, 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J9LQbImU1c&t=540)   but maybe pivotal to making life worth living under certain circumstances.
