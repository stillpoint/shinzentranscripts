<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=0)   So, in being ordained as a monk, I understand you had to undergo a hundred day period in 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=17)   solitary. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=20)   I would be very interested in hearing you talk about that experience. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=24)   That sounds like a significant event to go through. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=29)   It was pretty intense, especially for someone who is basically scattered, wimpy, and easily 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=36)   bored. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=39)   I had to every day do three buddharingana rituals, and sometimes those would take an 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=52)   hour or two, sometimes they'd take up to five hours. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=56)   And then in between there were many other activities. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=61)   The only human that I communicated with was my teacher. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=65)   Where were you? 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=67)   I was in isolation up at Mount Koya. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=70)   I had a room where I would stay, where I would sleep at night. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=76)   And then during the day I'd go to the hall, the main hall of the temple, and I would do 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=83)   the three ceremonies. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=85)   And then every two or three days I'd meet with the teacher who would teach me the next 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=91)   step in the ceremony. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=92)   So it's an initiation process. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=98)   So by the end of the hundred days I had learned all the basic ceremonies of the Japanese buddharingana 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=106)   practice. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=107)   On the surface they look like making offerings to deities, but in the depths what goes on 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=119)   is that you visualize yourself as the deity, so you replace your body image with the image 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=126)   of the deity. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=128)   You replace your internal talk with the mantra of the deity. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=134)   You make gestures with your hands called mudras, which impacts the physical body. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=142)   And then you create the feel in your body, the emotional quality of the deity. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=149)   You're doing all these simultaneously? 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=151)   All at the same time. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=153)   So you've got the physical body and emotional body helped by the mudras. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=157)   That's a lot to keep track of. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=160)   Well, yeah, that's the point. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=163)   You replace your personal internal talk with the mantra of the deity and talk space. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=169)   Then you visualize yourself as the deity, so you replace your own personal image with 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=175)   the deity's image. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=178)   Now since we identify with body and mind, whatever goes into the brain in the place 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=186)   where body and mind experience is processed, the brain says, this is who I am. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=193)   So if you replace the physicality and emotionality of your human self with that of an archetype, 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=202)   and you replace your mental images with that of the archetype, and you replace your internal 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=208)   talk with that of the archetype, you become the archetype. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=213)   Your identity shifts from your normal human existence to this other thing. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=219)   Now this is not insanity. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=223)   It has to be distinguished from two states, insanity and shamanic possession. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=228)   It's neither of those. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=230)   It's a systematic process designed to bring about classical enlightenment, but in a way 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=236)   very different from early Buddhism. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=238)   In early Buddhism, you would break things down. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=242)   This part is the physical body, this part is the emotional body. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=246)   You break things down into the pieces and then you would see, oh, I'm not these pieces. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=252)   In Vajrayana, what you do is you work with the same pieces, but you intentionally create 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=258)   mythical versions of them. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=261)   Notice that when you do that, you become that, and that gives you the exact same insight. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=266)   In other words, in early Buddhism, you got insight into the arbitrary nature of self-identification. 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=274)   You become enlightened, enlightened means that your identification process is elastic. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=280)   You're nothing particular, so you can be anything, so you're everything, but you're also the 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=284)   nothing that's the source of everything all at the same time. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=288)   In early Buddhism, they did that by dividing into pieces and then seeing, I'm none of these. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=295)   But in Vajrayana, you create a mythical version of it. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=300)   Notice that your identity shifts, and then when you drop that, your identity shifts back 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=305)   to the human, but you realize that it must all be arbitrary. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=310)   So the transition is where the insight comes. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=314)   Does it depend on which deity you pick? 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=318)   I mean, as an actor, you're envisioning other people and you're putting it in your body, 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=325)   but it's not a deity. 
<br>[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=327)   So I imagine what deity you're picking would affect the experience, or is it simply doesn't 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=333)   matter what you're picking? 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=336)   It's very interesting how they do it. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=338)   First they teach you how to do it with a wide variety of deities over that one, that hundred 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=345)   day period. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=347)   You get to explore many archetypes. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=349)   Pick your favorite deity. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=351)   Not quite, but you explore compassionate deities, you explore wrathful deities, you explore 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=359)   avatars of fear, you explore compassion and so forth. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=367)   After you've had a chance to explore all these identities, when you complete the training, 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=375)   then you get your full initiation. 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=380)   And at the full initiation, which lasts all night, they take you blindfolded in front 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=387)   of this giant mandala that has all the deities of the universe in it. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=392)   They give you a flower and you hold the flower and you're completely disoriented and you 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=401)   drop the flower. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=403)   Whatever flower the deity falls on, your master calls out the name of that deity. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=412)   That's the deity that is your Ishta Devata. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=416)   That's the deity that is going to be the one that has been selected by this process. 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=422)   Are you allowed to say what your deity was or is that a secret thing? 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_VizlDWcTA&t=427)   You're not allowed to say, but it's a very interesting process, yes.
