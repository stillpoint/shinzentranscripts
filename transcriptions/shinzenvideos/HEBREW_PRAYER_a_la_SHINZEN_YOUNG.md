title: "HEBREW PRAYER a la SHINZEN YOUNG"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=0)   So, sometimes during the Metta, I like to do a chant. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=13)   This is the chant that I do. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=17)   So I wanted to explain what it means. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=21)   Like I say, I'm not sure whether I do it or not. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=25)   It's sort of like spur of the moment. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=27)   But if you ever hear me do this chant, I want to make sure everybody understands that it's 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=35)   a spiritual, not political statement. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=40)   This is one of the main Hebrew prayers that my rabbi used to say all the time. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=49)   That's why I internalized it when I was a little boy. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=53)   But I like it because it can be given a really deep interpretation. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=62)   Excuse me while I let my whistle. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=66)   Shintzen, are you using that instead of the whiteboard? 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=71)   It was just lighter to carry over. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=76)   Can people see it? 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=77)   If not, I guess you'll have to... 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=80)   This particular thing, unless you read Hebrew, may not be all that relevant. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=88)   You know, if you sort of squint your eyes a little bit, it looks like Tibetan. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=94)   That's not a coincidence. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=96)   Can you believe that? 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=98)   That is not a coincidence. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=101)   Tibetan is derived from Devanagari script of India. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=106)   Devanagari script of India is derived from the Aramaic script, which has its origin in 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=115)   what is now called Lebanon. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=118)   And so does Hebrew, and so does Greek, and therefore Latin, and therefore our alphabet 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=125)   also. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=126)   Alphabet was only invented once. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=129)   It's one of the most extraordinary cases of cultural diffusion known. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=134)   Some years ago, some very clever people in what is now Lebanon figured out the concept 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=141)   of alphabet. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=142)   And it spread by diffusion all the way to Japan and Indonesia, and all the way to England. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=155)   Just went around the whole eastern hemisphere, basically. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=159)   They all go back to one source. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=161)   That's why alphabet from alpha, beta, gamma, delta, in Greek, aleph, bet, gimel, daled. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=170)   Okay, ain't a coincidence. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=173)   Anyway, this is Hebrew letters. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=179)   And it says, I hope I didn't screw it up. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=184)   I did it from memory. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=188)   Oseh shalom bimromav hu ya'aseh shalom aleinu ve'al kol Yisrael ve'imru. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=199)   Amen. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=200)   So this has this word, shin-lamet-men. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=209)   This is a really, really interesting three syllables. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=220)   The Arabic pronunciation is shalom. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=225)   The Hebrew pronunciation is shalom. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=228)   Usually understood as peace, but it means a lot more. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=233)   A lot more. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=235)   I'm not going to do it now, but in the past I've given an entire talk about how the entire 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=243)   path can be described in terms of permutations of these three letters. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=252)   Essentially it's not just peace. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=256)   It's peace that comes through completeness. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=260)   Shalom means complete as an adjective. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=268)   And so when you have a complete experience of something, okay, when you are complete 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=279)   with it, where does that lead to? 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=283)   It leads to the absolute peace of zero. 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=288)   So the process of completing leads to this peace. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=294)   And furthermore, it has a connotation of safety and well-being. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=300)   It's all sort of there. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=306)   The Afro-Asiatic languages, of which Hebrew is one, and so is Arabic, and so is Ancient 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=313)   Egyptian, they have a very different structure. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=319)   There's three consonants, and then vowels and other consonants are permuted around that 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=326)   or positioned around that to create words and grammatical forms. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=335)   So just the shilam alone, and then you could put vowels in different places. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=345)   You can make shalom, you can make Islam, Muslim, and so forth. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=354)   So anyway, this is a special kind of peace that comes about in my way of thinking through 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=363)   doing the activity of whatever it is. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=369)   And sure enough, osay, this means doing, okay? 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=378)   So may he or it who creates absolute peace, who is creating, actually this is a present 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=394)   participle, may the one who is creating the peace of heaven bring peace to you, ve'al 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=410)   kol Yisrael, that's the part I wanted to talk about, and upon all of Israel's. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=420)   So in my way of understanding, which is the way I choose to understand, Yisrael doesn't 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=431)   refer to a tribe or a nation. 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=438)   I like to think of it as the sangha, the community who struggles for spirituality, because actually 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=448)   Yisrael, if you remember the story of Jacob's ladder, et cetera, Yisrael is from a root 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=459)   that means to struggle. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=461)   So I interpret this as meaning to struggle to get to God, okay? 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=469)   So it has no political or ethnic connotations for me whatsoever within this statement, because 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=476)   I cannot imagine any kind of blessing that is limited to one nation or one ethnos. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=484)   So just wanted to make that clear. 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=486)   Ve'al kol Yisrael, ve'imru and say, that should be over there, amen, which you know 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=496)   from English, amen, so be it, something like that. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=501)   So if you ever hear me sing this during the Metta, you'll know what it refers to, because 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=507)   it has a lot of deep meaning. 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnxzK7JtrEc&t=512)   So just wanted to mention that.
