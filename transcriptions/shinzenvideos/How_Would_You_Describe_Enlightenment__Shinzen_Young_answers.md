title: "How Would You Describe Enlightenment? ~ Shinzen Young answers"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=0)   Someone asked me an interesting question in one of the onlines about no self and it sort 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=20)   of got me talking and thinking about the topic. There is a sometimes say that the Buddhists 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=33)   are their own worst PR people. I mean that the words that are used to try to sell Buddhism 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=42)   suffering, impermanence, emptiness, no self or even more inscrutable and off-putting no 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=59)   soul which is sometimes the translation. Of course there are very very good reasons why 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=68)   this terminology is used. But at first it's confusing and off-putting, I mean emptiness. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=81)   There's that Jewish Buddhist humor thing, I don't know if you've seen on the internet 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=85)   all these Jewish Buddhist jokes. There's one, I can't remember exactly, I'm paraphrasing, 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=93)   but what's Zen? Well you bust your tush for 40 years and what do you have to show for 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=108)   it at the end? Babkas. Babkas means, I mean it means beans literally, but it means like 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=116)   nothing, right? You've got nothing to show for it. Well yeah but it's a very special 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=123)   nothing. I mean when I started I had no idea what these terms referred to. They sounded 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=130)   weird, they sounded interesting. I learned how to say them in a half dozen Asian languages, 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=137)   but it's like I didn't know what they were talking about. Emptiness, well actually sometimes 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=143)   people would say like the void, so of course I had this image of this like gaping thing 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=151)   that's going to suck you in. Actually there's a little validity to that in the sense of 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=158)   the expansiveness of the formless jhanas. That's part of it, but not at all the whole 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=168)   picture. So you know I would hear about the void or the emptiness and I'd try to formulate 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=177)   in my mind what it must be. And of course it's not just the Buddhists that talk about 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=186)   things like that. Essentially all the mystics all around the world have used very similar 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=197)   languaging and the language is counterintuitive, it's strange sounding, and yet it lines up 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=207)   across cultures which tends to indicate that there's something universal going on here. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=214)   Why would the cultures that had no contact, I mean obviously sometimes the cultures have 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=220)   contact, there's cultural diffusion, but I mean why should something written in the 6th 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=228)   century in Sri Lanka line up so well with something written in the 16th century in Spain 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=236)   and those worlds had no contact at all. But you read Teresa Avila's Interior Castle and 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=244)   you read the Visuddhimagga and it's not perfect but there's a lot of alignment there, surprising 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=253)   alignment. Teresa ends up saying in the end it took her a lifetime, she went through the 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=260)   jhanas, the Christian version of that, and only at the very end of her career did she 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=267)   come to this transformation in her understanding. You can see that she struggles to convey the 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=277)   difference. She's described all of these ever deeper states of recollection, tranquility, 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=288)   and so forth, and then you can see her struggling to try to describe something that belonged 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=294)   to a whole other dimension. She said it was an intellectual vision, but then she said, 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=301)   but I don't mean that I saw a vision of Jesus or something, something changed in my mind 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=308)   and my concept about things and what changed was, to use her words, the self-forgetting 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=318)   is so profound that it seems as though the soul no longer exists. Well that's streametric. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=330)   The salient defining feature is insight into the non-somethingness of self, the sakhaya 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=340)   identity, the view that there is a sakhaya, a thing, an entity called self within. Now 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=348)   you might think that writing in the age of the Inquisition in Spain that someone would 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=357)   get in trouble for saying something like that, but she didn't get into trouble at all. In 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=362)   fact she became the main mapmaker for Christian mystics, it's like, okay, because she gave 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=369)   such clear descriptions. So it's sort of interesting that these descriptions somewhat line up and 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=376)   they're counterintuitive. So emptiness and nothingness is like across all the traditions. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=383)   So I, you know, in my mind I tried to imagine, and I mentioned that there was a period in 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=392)   my, when I and the rest of the United States was doing a lot of LSD, some of you remember 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=399)   that time, that's why you're here now. Anyway, so I had these ideas about what the void was 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=412)   supposed to be then, and I have ideas now, except the ideas now are not based on speculation, 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=421)   they're based on direct experience. So if I were to say what the emptiness means to 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=431)   me, what comes to my mind first, it's two things. A kind of bounciness, like a basketball 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=444)   that like bounces. And the second thing would be a connectivity, a connector that holds 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=456)   the whole universe together and therefore is naturally linked to a sense of love. So 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=463)   that's really counterintuitive, you wouldn't think emptiness would have either this springiness 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=471)   or a sense of connectivity or love, it just doesn't quite compute. But that's, those 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=481)   are the first things that come to my mind. So, and yet we also, I can also understand 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=490)   why they call it vacuity or emptiness or nothingness, etc., etc. So yeah, it's counterintuitive. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=501)   I could also tell you that like an apple, the first thing that hits your teeth when 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=509)   you bite into an apple is not necessarily representative of the whole apple. Unless 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=517)   you peel it, you get the skin which is sort of hard and dry. But most of the apple is 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=524)   going to be juicy and sweet. And the first bite that people take into emptiness, which 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=532)   is a phase that might last a few hours or a few years, when your teeth are just getting 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=540)   beyond the skin, that's not, that experience might be sort of bleak and flat and vacuous. 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=551)   But that's just getting past the skin. Once you're past that, it's this other thing, it's 
<br>[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=559)   this springy connectivity that provides safety, fulfillment and a sense of love. So anyway, 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=578)   the, in the online someone asked me the different flavors of no-self. And every time I think 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=590)   about that, I come up with a different list over the years. So like a list came up to 
<br>[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=598)   me and I thought it was interesting, so I thought I would share it with you. But who 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=604)   knows what it will be next month or next year. That's the thing, it's, you know the story 
<br>[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=611)   of the elephant and the blind man, but you may not know that that comes from Buddhism. 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=620)   It's a metaphor. The elephant is enlightenment. People have, tend to see a certain part of 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=632)   it and so describe it. Well, it's like a rope or it's like a wall or it's like a pillar 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=640)   or it's like a sharp, like a tusk. Or it's like a hose. Well, yeah, all of that, all 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=651)   of that, because there's all these different facets to it, which is, can be confusing. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=659)   So it's important not to fixate one's view. One of my teachers used to say, 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=666)   Kyo no satori wa ashita no machigai. Today's enlightenment is tomorrow's mistake. 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=673)   Meaning not error, but rather that your perspective broadens and deepens and changes as time goes 
<br>[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=680)   on. So when people do come to an experience, either slowly and smoothly or suddenly, of 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=690)   emptiness, no self, what have you, one of the first pieces of advice I give them is 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=695)   don't fixate however compelling today's view of it may be for you. Don't fixate that it's 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=705)   got to be that way. And for God's sake, don't stop studying with competent teachers. Because 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=712)   sometimes people go off, they think they're done when they're just beginning, actually. 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=721)   So we have this meeting that takes place every few years, where the so-called Western teachers, 
<br>[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=737)   which means people teaching Buddhism full-time in the West, it doesn't have anything to do 
<br>[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=743)   with your race, it's just where your main activity is, is it in the Americas and Europe 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=749)   and so forth, as opposed to the homeland of Buddhism, Asia. So there's this Western teachers 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=756)   meeting and it's like a professional meeting for people that do this full-time. So it's 
<br>[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=765)   interesting and for me, I've always enjoyed it. It's a lot of fun. And it's like a professional 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=774)   meeting and people discuss topics and so forth. So this was a number of years ago, we broke 
<br>[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=787)   up into interest groups. So you got to choose what interest group you're going to be. So 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=797)   I chose the group that was called, quote, how do you deal with the issue of enlightenment? 
<br>[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=806)   So I thought that sounds interesting. I'll go to that group because I definitely have 
<br>[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=812)   some ideas. But it was like sort of sad because it turns out it wasn't what I thought it was. 
<br>[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=829)   The topic was not what I thought. I thought it's like, okay, a bunch of teachers are going 
<br>[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=833)   to get together and tell their strategies and their algorithms for leading people to 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=839)   stream entering. But that's not what it was about. It was about how do you avoid marginalizing 
<br>[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=851)   students who aren't yet enlightened and still talk about enlightenment. It was like the 
<br>[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=859)   avatar of everything that's wrong with politically correct. Sorry if that offended someone. But 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=868)   it's like, well, we don't want to make people feel bad because they're not enlightened yet 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=877)   or whatever. So it's like, oh, well, that's not what I thought that was going to be. So 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=888)   let me say what I couldn't say in that meeting. Well, in general, any approach has the potential 
<br>[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=906)   of showing you the no self, any approach. So it's not like one is privileged over another. 
<br>[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=916)   And in fact, it's not infrequent that no approach shows someone no self. So people that don't 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=925)   meditate, that don't have a practice, it just happens. Not uncommon. So in theory, any of 
<br>[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=937)   the techniques can do the trick or some combination thereof. But if someone were to come to me 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=948)   and actually specifically say, I want stream entry, what I would probably start them off 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=955)   on is the focus in technique. That entails working with mental images, mental talk, and 
<br>[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=964)   body motion. I'm saying that's what I would probably start off with, not like, oh yes, 
<br>[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=970)   this is the silver bullet, the white knight, the magic thing that guarantees stream entry. 
<br>[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=978)   But for me, in my algorithm, it's a good place to start because it's pretty straightforward. 
<br>[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=985)   A beginner can do it. And it's likely to bring some sort of insight fairly quickly. So the 
<br>[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=996)   idea is that you go to image space and there's either images or there isn't. So you note, 
<br>[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1006)   see or rest. Then you go to talk space, same thing. Emotional body, same thing. Then you 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1011)   work with the whole system. So when you're working with the whole system, different things 
<br>[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1021)   can happen. One of the things that can happen is that the system goes offline, typically 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1029)   momentarily. Mental screen is blank, head is quiet, body is emotionally neutral. Now, 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1041)   typically the reason that happens is that something in the outer system sort of expands 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1051)   in intensity. A physical sensation or a sound. There's a lot of famous Zen stories along 
<br>[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1059)   these lines. Someone's enlightened by hearing a pebble strike the broom or the teacher shouts. 
<br>[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1076)   Or one of my favorites, when you take a bath in the Zen temple in Japan, you bathe in something 
<br>[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1087)   that looks like this except it's like huge and it's a pot actually that's heated from 
<br>[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1093)   the bottom. You take off all your clothes and there's this statue of Baradwaja, who's 
<br>[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1104)   the patron of the bathing area. You have to bow down like this or whatever because he 
<br>[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1111)   was an arhat and the way he got enlightenment was taking a bath. Okay. It's like, okay, 
<br>[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1118)   a bath can do it. So typically external sight, external sound and body and or physical body 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1131)   sensation sort of impinges suddenly. And if you're monitoring the inner system, instead 
<br>[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1140)   of getting pulled into that, you notice that as that expands, the inner system goes into 
<br>[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1146)   a state of relative rest. Now that can happen to people in an early part of their practice. 
<br>[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1155)   That's already, that's not like enlightenment or anything, but they're already getting a 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1161)   sort of insight as to how this system works. Now there's another version of that that's 
<br>[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1171)   more dramatic. And if that happens and you have a clear experience, that might change 
<br>[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1180)   things on a more permanent basis. Instead of the inner system going into a relative 
<br>[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1187)   state of rest, meaning see rest, hear rest, feel rest, you're aware your screen is blank, 
<br>[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1193)   you're listening to quiet in your head, your body's emotionally neutral. Instead of that, 
<br>[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1201)   you're aware that the inner space itself just vanishes. There is no image space, there is 
<br>[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1212)   no talk space, there is no emotional body space. That's absolute rest in the inner system. 
<br>[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1223)   It's like the relative rest that a beginner can have only more so. So one flavor of no 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1233)   self even a beginner can experience. It's like for a moment there's relative rest, maybe 
<br>[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1242)   because there's a strong activation on the outside. The inner system gets relatively 
<br>[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1248)   restful. Then there's a much more impactful restful state that's an absolute rest, a cessation 
<br>[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1260)   of the space of self itself. So there's two flavors of no self right there. What else? 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1271)   Well does that mean that in order to experience no self the inner system has to turn off? 
<br>[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1279)   Well not necessarily. The inner system can be quite active, but it's not tangled and 
<br>[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1295)   not coagulated. If the inner system activates even strongly, but all the strands are clearly 
<br>[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1306)   separate, they're not crisscrossing in an unconscious way, and if there's little or 
<br>[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1313)   no freezing or coagulation in that system, it'll be active, but it's a kind of flow self. 
<br>[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1325)   And that is yet another flavor of no self. It's tricky though to truly untangle that 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1335)   inner system because the tangling is at many scales simultaneously. My metaphor would be 
<br>[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1343)   if, let's say you have three kinds of strands, red, green and blue. The problem is they exist 
<br>[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1353)   at many, many diameters. There's like, you know, there's three inch thick and one inch 
<br>[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1362)   thick and a tenth of an inch thick and, you know, a half a centimeter and a millimeter 
<br>[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1373)   and even sub-millimeter. There's all, for each one of the three colors there's all these 
<br>[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1382)   different scales and now they're all intertwined. So inside red is subtle blue and inside that 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1391)   is subtler green, etc., etc., and then maybe even subtler red again. So to fully untangle 
<br>[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1400)   that scale takes a little bit of practice. But if you can sufficiently untangle it and 
<br>[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1409)   if you can let go of the tendency to tighten around its arising and passing, oh my God, 
<br>[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1419)   did it take me years to not resist the arising of self. Because I thought, well, the goal 
<br>[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1428)   of this practice is quote no self, so if I'm aware of a self I'm a failure with the practice 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1433)   and that creates all sorts of tension. It took a long time to get out of that bad rookie 
<br>[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1442)   habit. So anyway, the inner system activates perhaps even strongly, perhaps even in a very 
<br>[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1453)   negative way, but it's untangled and unblocked. That will create another flavor of self, of 
<br>[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1466)   no self rather. It's a freedom because of intensity of clarity. It's an untangling effect. 
<br>[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1477)   It's an anti-emergent quality. Turns out that one of the requisites for the somethingness 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1486)   of self is that there be a kind of tangling of things. So the satkhyaditti depends on 
<br>[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1499)   lack of clarity. In fact, you probably know that there's a traditional metaphor that's 
<br>[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1509)   very famous in the Buddhist world. A monk named Nagasena learned it from a nun named 
<br>[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1525)   Vajira and he passed it on to King Melinda, also known as King Menandros. So Melinda is 
<br>[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1536)   what he was known as in Pali, but his Greek name was Menandros. He was a Greek king about 
<br>[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1547)   2,000 years ago in the western part of India, part of the remnant from Alexander's invasions 
<br>[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1556)   of India. So he's a westerner and he had this dialogue with the Buddhist monk Nagasena and 
<br>[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1566)   it's recorded in Pali literature. It's fascinating. We know that this Menandros was a real person 
<br>[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1572)   because he's recorded in Greek history also. In the western accounts, it is said that he 
<br>[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1586)   died very peacefully. So maybe it's true that he did actually become a Buddhist meditator. 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1595)   In any event, the conversation has been preserved. It's called Melinda Panha, the questions of 
<br>[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1603)   King Melinda or Menandros. So Nagasena gives the metaphor of a chariot and he goes through 
<br>[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1617)   all the different parts of the chariot and says, is the chariot the wheels? Is the chariot 
<br>[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1624)   the body? Is the chariot the axle tree? Is the chariot this, that? And the king has to 
<br>[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1631)   admit, no, none of those parts are it. And then he says, well, it's the same for self. 
<br>[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1637)   And then he goes through the five aggregates or something like that. I can't remember exactly. 
<br>[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1643)   He sort of breaks selfhood into its components and tries to show the king that there is no 
<br>[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1649)   thing inside called a self. So that's a famous metaphor. I have my own version, which I think 
<br>[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1663)   is more to the point, neuroanatomically. And most of you have heard this, but I'll just 
<br>[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1675)   go over it quickly. So you have an old-fashioned CRT TV screen and monitor and there's white 
<br>[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1689)   on the screen. It's a color monitor, but it shows white on the screen. And I say to you, 
<br>[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1695)   there is no quality of white on this screen. And you say, are you nuts? Just look at it. 
<br>[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1702)   It's white. And I say, well, here's a magnifying glass. And we agree that this does nothing 
<br>[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1711)   but make things a little bigger and resolve. Resolve means things that fall together to 
<br>[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1720)   the naked eye are separated by the lens. You can look this up if you want to know what 
<br>[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1726)   the resolution power is. Resolution power doesn't change what's out there. It just means 
<br>[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1732)   that things that are tangled get untangled. And I say, okay, so now we're going to approach 
<br>[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1740)   this white screen with this magnifying glass, which we agree does nothing but make things 
<br>[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1746)   look larger and resolve. In other words, untangle the sensory components. And what's going to 
<br>[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1754)   happen as we approach? The impression white will go away and the impression red, green, 
<br>[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1762)   blue little pixels will arise. And that's what was always there. So an emergent quality. 
<br>[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1769)   This is a metaphor, just like Naga Singh and Sister Vajira's metaphor. This is a metaphor 
<br>[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1777)   that probably is a little closer to the actual underlying neuroscience of the thing, although 
<br>[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1786)   it's probably not identical, but I think it's closer than the traditional one. There's an 
<br>[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1793)   emergent property in perception that requires a tangling of the sensory components. And 
<br>[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1804)   as they get untangled, that emergent quality disappears. In the case of the white on the 
<br>[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1812)   screen, the emergent quality is the impression of whiteness. In the case of self, the emergent 
<br>[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1820)   quality is the impression it's a thing. So as you look more and more carefully, I like 
<br>[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1831)   to do it inner-seer field, but we could do the five skandhas, we could do the four elements, 
<br>[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1836)   we could do the four foundations of mindfulness. There's a lot of ways that you can parse that 
<br>[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1845)   pie. The important thing is not so much what categories you use, but the magic of the dimensional 
<br>[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1855)   analysis. I like the inner-seer field because it satisfies Occam's razor. It's the simplest 
<br>[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1865)   one that I know of. You can look up the five aggregates or five skandhas on Wikipedia and 
<br>[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1874)   see if you can imagine meditating based on the definitions you see there, because it's 
<br>[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1879)   pretty inscrutable. But anyway, so that's why I like to use this other thing. It's simpler 
<br>[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1892)   and it's immediately observable. You have to be a very, very advanced meditator to be 
<br>[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1898)   able to observe the samskaras, for example. No beginner can observe that, but any beginner 
<br>[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1908)   can observe inner-seer field. So that's another flavor of no-self. That's the no-self that 
<br>[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1917)   just comes from untangling the system. Are there other flavors of no-self? Yeah. If there's 
<br>[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1936)   enough unblocking, if there's enough decoagulation, the inner system arises as sort of like a 
<br>[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1949)   lot of vibrating bubbles. It's like effervescent bubbles. It's all flow. If you get that where 
<br>[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1961)   the inner system is mostly like just shimmering on your screen and stirring in talk space 
<br>[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1969)   and a kind of undercurrent of activity in the emotional body that may not have any particular 
<br>[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1977)   flavor to it, but it's like the emotional circuits are sort of idling down there. If 
<br>[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1983)   you get this fluid experience of the inner system, that's a whole other flavor of no-self. 
<br>[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=1990)   What I like to do when that happens is cover inner space because you may not be able to 
<br>[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2000)   parse the seer field very clearly when it goes into that subtle level of vibratory flow, 
<br>[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2010)   but what you can do is cover the whole space and then just let your awareness soak into 
<br>[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2015)   it. The more you soak into it, the more vibrant the space becomes. Okay, well that's a whole 
<br>[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2023)   other flavor of no-self which is sort of like the flow-self. Some of these flavors of no-self 
<br>[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2037)   are available to beginning meditators. Some of them not so much. The disappearance of 
<br>[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2046)   inner space, that's a little bit on the advanced side. There's also an advanced version of 
<br>[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2055)   the flow-self. If the system becomes pliant enough, each time there's an inner activation, 
<br>[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2069)   that means each time there's a reaction to the outer world, each time there's memory 
<br>[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2074)   plant fantasy, each time there's a judgment or a conviction or a confusion that arises 
<br>[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2081)   in the inner system, each time there's an awareness that was fermented into existence 
<br>[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2094)   by simultaneous expansion and contraction. Now, when that starts to happen, the ordinary 
<br>[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2105)   self, all these ordinary things, including your confusions and your desires and your 
<br>[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2114)   judgments, they're never disconnected from the Source because they arise in the folds 
<br>[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2125)   of expansion and contraction. Sort of the two sides of God, if you want to sort of get 
<br>[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2135)   the G word. Some people don't like that word, but I like it. If you don't, then use something 
<br>[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2142)   else. Expansion and contraction. So expansion and contraction, they touch each ordinary 
<br>[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2154)   part of you. On the other hand, they touch that collapse of space thing also, because 
<br>[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2166)   that's where they come from. Plus and minus pull apart, expansion and contraction polarize. 
<br>[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2182)   And then they neutralize. When they neutralize, the space of experience goes away. And when 
<br>[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2189)   that happens with the inner space, that's absolute rest. And then that absolute rest 
<br>[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2196)   breaks apart into the absolute flow of simultaneous expansion and contraction. So it's an extraordinary 
<br>[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2204)   thing when your ordinary experience of self is embraced on the inside and outside by the 
<br>[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2216)   spiritual Source. And then there's no reason why that doesn't also extend out to the outer 
<br>[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2226)   sphere field. So actually, when someone gets enlightened, the world gets enlightened. There's 
<br>[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2234)   a famous Zen story to that effect. This person struggled for years and years and years as 
<br>[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2243)   a monk to get enlightenment. It didn't work out. And he was living on this mountain called 
<br>[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2248)   Dozan. And finally he gave up and went to the master. And the master told him something. 
<br>[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2259)   I don't remember the exact story. But he said, okay, if you have to leave the temple, you 
<br>[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2265)   know, you have to leave. But something, sorry, I forgot what the something was. But as he's 
<br>[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2274)   going down the mountain, whatever that something was, it had planted the seed. And he suddenly 
<br>[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2283)   had this realization after all these years of struggling and confusion. And he blurted 
<br>[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2290)   out the words that just came out of his mouth were, the mountain has become enlightened, 
<br>[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2298)   not I became enlightened. So what does that mean? It just means that the external see,

<br>[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2355)   no self. And at least a couple of those would be something you can understand and even a 
<br>[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKM6w1aXa4&t=2363)   beginner can pursue with practice.
