<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUy1nAVhvTA&t=0)   So, basically, with regards to responsibility and work, I'm lazy. The only saving grace 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUy1nAVhvTA&t=11)   that I have is that a lot of things that are fun and play for me are considered by others 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUy1nAVhvTA&t=20)   to be work. Otherwise, I would be one of those homeless people.
