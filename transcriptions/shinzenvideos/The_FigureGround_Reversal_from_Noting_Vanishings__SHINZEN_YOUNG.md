title: "The Figure/Ground Reversal from Noting Vanishings ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=0)   I have a question about just now. I have been doing that practice a lot the last few days. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=17)   And at first it just sounded very fulfilling and rewarding noticing bad things. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=25)   And I guess starting yesterday and more so this morning, more and more I am attracted to vanishings where the intervals are shorter and shorter and shorter. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=39)   You mean the intervals between the vanishings get shorter? 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=43)   No, no, no. Either hearing or seeing or feeling where you are getting closer to a vibration. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=55)   Well it started yesterday where I would be hearing intervals, for example, in a bird chirping where it would begin with I could mentally know gone and then something so fast where I could barely mentally know gone. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=74)   And ultimately I am aware of gone-ness because I can hear the vibration and the chirping but I don't have the sensory clarity to know gone. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=88)   Well, that's your sensory clarity that you are aware that there is this continuous gone-ness and then every once in a while you get more noticeable macro-gones that will punctuate the continuous micro-gone. 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=108)   So that is your sensory clarity is to be detecting that in addition to the macro-gones occasionally. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=118)   And that's something that I refer to in the manual as the figure ground reversal. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=125)   That's what's beginning to happen is gone is less something you are observing and more something that's always there and it's the observer that's coming and going. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=139)   That's a huge shift in one's practice. That's basically the shift from observing the self to manifesting the self. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=155)   That was my next question. I was in the Pacific before the break. I was noting gone on a, I don't know if it was in the room or in my ear, but basically a vibratory hum in which I could detect gone-ness again until I noted it and it felt more like presence than absence. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=183)   Yeah, yeah, that's right. Right. That's exactly, that's the figure ground reversal that I refer to in the manual as one of the possible things that can happen as you're doing it. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=195)   Basically the intervals of something-ness between vanishings, they get shorter and in between there's less and less something-ness until if there's anything in between the gones it's just both. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFx4ywJNSHc&t=214)   There's in-out flow, gone, in-out flow, gone, in-out flow, gone, and the cleft is like the black hole. It polarizes but it just then re-collapses to the black hole and doesn't decide to do a big bang and make a universe.
