title: "How Intense Emotions Can Be No Problem - SHINZEN YOUNG"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=0)   The ancient Taoists had experienced the same thing and had an interesting phraseology for it. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=15)   It relates to jing qi shan, which are terms that you may be familiar with if you've studied Asian medicine 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=29)   or martial arts and so forth. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=31)   So jing means essence, literally. So essence of what? 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=36)   Well, in terms of sensory experience, often in the process of completing an experience, 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=48)   a certain flavor has to sort of get distilled and dominate your awareness. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=59)   And that distillation of that experience could be described in Chinese as jing, or essence. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=67)   Now in the Taoist practice, this particular distillation that they often worked with was sexual sensation. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=77)   But this can be generalized to any kind of experience, and it doesn't necessarily have to be in the body, 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=86)   although it's sort of easiest to understand there, but the same thing can happen in visual and in auditory. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=95)   You sort of... everything gets distilled. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=99)   So let's say, for example, you are working on having fear no longer be an issue for you. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=114)   How can that be? Because there's so many circumstances of fear in this world, 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=122)   so many legitimate reasons to be afraid. It just goes on and on and on. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=129)   How can it be that a human being could become a human being for whom fear is no longer an issue? 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=139)   Broader still. If you can do that, well, why not add in grief and sadness? 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=148)   Or anger? Or on a more mundane note, that frenetic impatience that we have all day, 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=162)   that comes out when you're in a traffic jam? 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=169)   Which is very ordinary, but actually a source of significant suffering in the world. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=178)   And now at the other extreme, what you would hardly think any human being could ever come to grips with, 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=190)   shame and embarrassment. How about that one? 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=194)   So anger, fear, sadness, embarrassment, impatience, disgust. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=201)   Those are the big six on the negative side of flavors of human emotion. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=210)   I know for sure that a human being can reach the point where those are no longer an issue for them. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=227)   So how is that possible? How is it possible to do with all of those? 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=231)   How is it possible to do with even one of those? 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=234)   Well, first you have to be willing to allow it to distill into an essence. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=247)   What that means is that particular favor, whichever one it is, anger, fear, sadness, 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=257)   each one has its own very distinct quality in the body. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=263)   So the essence of fear occurs when there is nothing but the fear sensation. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=276)   It is in every cubic centimeter of your body, and it is continuous, unbroken in time, for a period of time. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=290)   Now, we're very, very afraid of what the consequences of that would be. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=301)   But the fear of the consequences of that is actually what keeps us imprisoned for our whole life. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=309)   Because the consequences of allowing it to become essence, in the way I've just described, 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=316)   the consequences are nothing negative at all. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=322)   The long-term consequences are freedom. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=328)   But because we're afraid to let it go to that point, very few people become free. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=337)   So if the shit really hits the fan to the point where you cannot avoid 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=347)   one or a combination of these negative emotions becoming essence, 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=353)   well, in a sense that could be a very good thing. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=358)   So I repeat, there is nothing but that flavor, essentially hardly aware of anything else in the body. 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=368)   It's everywhere, and it's continuous through time. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=374)   So now you are inundated with the essence of shame, or grief, or fear. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=385)   Or the impatience associated with being in a traffic jam and you're late to an appointment. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=394)   That one is just about as hard to work with as all the others. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=398)   It took me, oh my God, from the time I realized what the task was, 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=405)   which is what I'm now describing to you, from the time I realized what the task was, 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=412)   to the time where I could actually do it with that impatience thing in traffic and not suffer. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=421)   Well, I don't want to... Maybe I shouldn't say this. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=427)   Twenty years. But the twenty years passed anyway. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=432)   I know what you're saying, well, I don't have twenty years. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=437)   But that's another Dharma talk. I'm going to give a talk about aging. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=442)   But the quick answer is, aging is a natural state of no-self. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=450)   So you've got something going for you. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=454)   But if you're young and have twenty years, well, it might not take you twenty years, 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=459)   but it took me twenty years to get to the point where it really felt good, like liberating, 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=468)   to have that level of essence with impatience. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=476)   Like I say, if you're already old, you've already got some things going for you, 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=482)   we'll talk about that later. So there's hope in both cases. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=490)   So it becomes essence. 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=495)   And then it starts to get sort of liquidy. 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=510)   化精为气 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=513)   The essence converts into a kind of energy that is first sort of liquidy 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=524)   and then sort of shimmering and gaseous. 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=534)   And then 化气为善 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=543)   That becomes this effortless, simultaneous, formless, rich doing of space, spaciousness, 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=564)   effortlessly spreading, effortlessly collapsing. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=569)   And it's at that point that you have a complete experience of that particular essence. 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=580)   It has now become 善, pure spirit. 
<br>[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=586)   Now, as I say, they did this traditionally with sexual sensations. 
<br>[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=595)   So it's the same process. 
<br>[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=599)   The sexual sensation inundates the entire body, there's nothing but that. 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=607)   And it's very hard to have equanimity with that. 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=610)   It's hard to have equanimity with uncomfortable things, 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=613)   but it's also hard to have equanimity with intense pleasures. 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=617)   And then it starts to flow everywhere. 
<br>[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=623)   And then it's sort of like more gaseous. 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=628)   And then it's just pure space. 
<br>[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=631)   And that's what the Tibetans called 德同意而美 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=634)   The non-duality of bliss and void. 
<br>[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=643)   So if you can go through that phase progression with just a half dozen negatives, 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=655)   it's a small list. 
<br>[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=657)   Unfortunately, each one of those essences, each one of those flavors, 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=664)   has been honed by Darwin to control animals. 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=672)   And by Darwin I don't mean the man Darwin, 
<br>[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=675)   I mean natural selection over millions and millions of years. 
<br>[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=680)   So it is very hard to allocate all your resources 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=693)   to having a complete experience of these things, 
<br>[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=696)   because everything in the sensation says, 
<br>[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=703)   I got to do something about this, I got to do something about this, 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=705)   I got to do something about this, 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=707)   because those sensations have been honed by evolution 
<br>[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=711)   to make animals do something quickly about something. 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=719)   Either approach it and eat it, or run away from it, etc. etc. 
<br>[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=727)   Or make love to it, etc. etc. etc. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=733)   So it's very hard to just allocate the totality of your resources towards completing. 
<br>[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=741)   But all you have to do is do that a few times, 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=746)   or well, more than a few times, a few hundred times. 
<br>[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=751)   And then it becomes habitual. 
<br>[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=754)   Then for the rest of your life, 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=756)   you will have experiences in your emotional world 
<br>[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD1ny_Q8sKo&t=763)   that are maximally poignant and minimally problematic. 
<br>
