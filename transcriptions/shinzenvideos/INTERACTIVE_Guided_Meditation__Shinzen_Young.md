title: "INTERACTIVE Guided Meditation? ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=0)   So as far as I know, you have developed a form of teaching that I've never known of 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=14)   before, interactive guided meditation, where instead of telling someone what to do to meditate 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=23)   or describing it to a group while they meditate, you one-on-one interactively work with someone 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=32)   and talk to them while they're meditating, with them talking back to you. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=36)   Can you tell me how you came up with this? 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=42)   First let me say, of course, that's not the only way that I teach. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=46)   I do those other things too, groups and so forth. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=51)   But what I really love is the one-on-one work, which can be done face-to-face in person, 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=60)   but also works very well over the telephone, which is enormously convenient because people 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=66)   that study with me, I give them my telephone number and they can call me when they're in 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=73)   crisis or when they just need to tune up and so forth. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=77)   So we can work over the phone also that way. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=81)   So I can do it face-to-face or I can do it over the telephone with someone. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=88)   How it developed was that I had my own center in Los Angeles many years ago and we had residents 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=97)   and they would sit, we would sit as a group early in the morning and then they would go 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=104)   off and do their jobs and then we'd come back and we'd sit together in the evenings. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=109)   So what I would do is during the morning sits is I would give them interviews and that's 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=114)   very standard. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=115)   You go into a teacher and you sort of talk about your practice. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=119)   But typically the interviews that are done last for 10 minutes, something like that. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=127)   You get a chance to ask some questions, we sort of touch base and so forth. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=132)   So when I started I was doing those kinds of standard interviews and I don't know quite 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=137)   how it occurred to me but it just sort of gradually dawned on me, well wait a minute, 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=145)   you know, what's the metaphor for a meditation teacher? 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=149)   Well there's a lot of possible metaphors. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=152)   The Buddha described himself as a physician. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=155)   You know there's a disease called suffering and I have an intervention that is a sufficient 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=162)   cure for that. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=164)   So I thought, well what's the metaphor for me? 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=168)   I'm a coach. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=172)   So what does a coach do? 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=173)   Well if you go to the YMCA you ask a staff member to show you how to use the equipment 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=182)   and then they stand by you and they make sure you're using the equipment properly and they 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=187)   have good form and they give you some encouragements and they answer your questions and they sort 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=192)   of check in with you. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=194)   So I thought, well gee, that's a natural way to go about this. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=200)   So I started to say, okay, do this and then I would just sit with them and do my own meditation 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=207)   and then so ten minutes later, okay, when you did that, what happened? 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=213)   And they would say, well this happened or that happened. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=216)   And then I would say, okay, it means this or I think you should modify it just a little 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=223)   bit, it might help and so forth. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=226)   And we'd like sit for a few more minutes and we'd do that. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=230)   And I started to notice it was really working. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=235)   Because when you first learn how to meditate, if you're working in the mindfulness tradition, 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=244)   you're really wearing two hats. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=247)   On one hand, you're the meditator. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=250)   On the other hand, you're trying to observe yourself and that's very tricky. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=254)   It's very hard to do that until you internalize the skill. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=258)   So if somebody interactively guides you, you can let go of the hat of being the meditator. 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=266)   You just follow their guidance and you can stay with your experience. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=273)   So as time went on, I started to develop a more and more elaborate decision tree until 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=282)   it became this incredibly powerful algorithm that just loops and branches until the person 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=290)   has a breakthrough experience and works with a high degree of reliability. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=299)   So it's a combination of you not having to wear the two hats plus the sort of presence 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=307)   of an experienced teacher as a sort of contact high kind of impact. 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=317)   Plus the sharing of a lot of expert knowledge because I know the windows of opportunity 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=324)   that nature presents literally minute to minute. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=329)   Nature is constantly presenting people with windows to transcendence. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=334)   People don't know how to recognize it. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=337)   When I'm working interactively with somebody, I spot when a window is open and I point them 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=343)   in that direction. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=345)   It just works like a charm. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=347)   And that's where it's really like a designer meditation because when someone does a guided 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=353)   meditation, you're still handing over the wheel. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=356)   Someone else is still driving on that. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=359)   But what this does is it know two guidances. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=363)   I think I've been guided privately in meditation over the years with you. 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=366)   I don't know how many times, dozens and dozens, and it's never been the same way twice. 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=373)   So I think of it kind of as a designer meditation in that moment using those opportunities. 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=380)   Yes, that's the general idea. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=383)   The trick is not so much knowing how to answer your questions. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=390)   The trick is for me to know what are the important questions. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=394)   That's what's taken all the years. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=396)   To find out what are the important things to look for as a person meditates. 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=402)   So I know what the right questions are, the most significant ones. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=407)   The questions for you to ask? 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=408)   The questions that I ask you as you're meditating. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=412)   That's been the challenge. 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=414)   And then to find optimal answers for each one of those questions. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=418)   So if I ask you ten questions that are absolutely fundamental, and let's say each one has two 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=428)   possible answers, that means after ten questions I have found the one out of a thousand guidances 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=435)   that is optimal for you. 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=438)   If I ask you twenty questions, which could easily happen in an hour period of practice, 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=444)   I have found the one out of one million guidances that is optimal for you. 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=451)   So it's like having a tape library with a million tapes and a wizard that decides for 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=457)   you what is optimal for you by asking you the right questions. 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=462)   So yeah, you bet it works. 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=463)   We're off to see the wizard. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=464)   You bet it works. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=465)   That's why it works. 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=466)   Well, that plus the other things we talked about. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDmJ-3nLYNk&t=469)   Very effective.
