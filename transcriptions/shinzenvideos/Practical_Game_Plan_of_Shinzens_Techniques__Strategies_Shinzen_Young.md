<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=17)   We're reaching out to people. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=18)   Now what I decided to do was, okay, if we're flying under the banner of an attentional 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=27)   skill set, well, we want them to apply these skills in a way that they're going to dramatically 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=41)   grow. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=42)   So I outlined this in the What is Mindfulness, what this whole strategy is. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=51)   So the categories of the basic mindfulness system are designed to produce insights right 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=57)   off the bat. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=60)   So that it's not just that they're going to get a little bit of concentration kind of 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=65)   thing, but they're explicitly developing concentration, sensory clarity, equanimity, and they're 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=71)   learning how to parse their sensory experience in such a way that the fundamental insights 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=79)   can arise without us trying to get them to believe a certain thing. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=86)   So we're going to provide you with an attentional skill set, we're going to provide you with 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=91)   a way of analyzing your sensory experience, which is, it's not any doctrine or belief 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=97)   system, it's obviously is the case that we see and we hear and we feel. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=104)   And then people can hopefully start to have really significant experiences. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77DrSnpVf2M&t=113)   So that to me is a modern and incredible opportunity for upaya.
