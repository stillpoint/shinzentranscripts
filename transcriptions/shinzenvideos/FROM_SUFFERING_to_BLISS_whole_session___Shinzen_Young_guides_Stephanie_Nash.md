<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=0)   Okay, so you mentioned you wanted to work on some specific issues. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=27)   Anything you'd like to just tell me briefly about those issues before we start to work 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=32)   in terms of what it is and what your goals would be in working on it? 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=40)   Yeah, what I'm working with now is a strong feel component that has, you might call it 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=54)   touch, I sometimes call it secondary feel, but that tension that comes around the feel 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=59)   can lock into quite a dramatic degree. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=64)   When it first arose, it seemed triggered by external event, but what I, it's a response, 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=71)   an emotional response to an event, but I think it became clear that as I processed it, that 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=79)   it kind of worked as a magnet to draw years, who knows what other stuff up with it that 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=86)   matched that emotional frequency. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=92)   And then for a while now, several days, I've been working with it. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=99)   I let go of there having to be any talk image component. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=103)   And it's just a huge amount of feel which I have techniques and ability to process, 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=109)   but it's quite a significant event. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=114)   And I thought, ah, time to call in the big guns. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=118)   And I thought you could help me with this and maybe someone could benefit from that 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=123)   help. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=124)   Let me ask some questions so I can make sure I understand the situation. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=130)   You're having a lot of emotional type body sensation, what I call feel. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=135)   But I think that you're saying that you have a muscle tension reaction to that feel when 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=145)   it arises. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=146)   When, I think there's a very, very strong feel and because it is so nonstop and intense 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=154)   that the body just starts to tighten around it in a way that I'm working not only with 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=160)   the feel, but I have to kind of work with the tightening that comes around it. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=165)   And so I might work with one, then work with the other, but there's no question the core, 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=172)   it's feel. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=173)   And everything else is just because it's been so intense for so long, the body's just starting 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=177)   to, and I'm literally now experiencing physiological things in the body just simply from that tightening 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=186)   around the feel. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=187)   Does that make sense? 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=188)   Yes. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=189)   And so you want to work with this sensory phenomenon, the underlying emotional sensations 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=195)   or feel as we would put it in the technical vocabulary, body sensation that seems emotional. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=202)   And then there's a kind of physical response in the form of muscle tension. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=208)   And that muscle tension, some people consider that to be a purely physical sensation. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=216)   But because it's so linked with the emotion, some people consider it to be in and of itself 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=222)   an emotional sensation. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=224)   We can parse it either way depending on what's natural for that person. 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=229)   I have a few other questions to ask you. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=232)   It sounds to me like you've already been working with it in the way that I would consider optimal. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=239)   By that I mean that you're sometimes focusing on the tension reaction, sometimes focusing 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=247)   on the underlying feel itself, which is the general strategy of divine and conquer. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=256)   And I've been using a lot of, you know, flow is probably where my natural strength is. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=264)   And so, and I can work with flow and almost immediately have some kind of response to 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=271)   that of going into it. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=272)   But then it re-arises and re-congeals so I thought, okay, I've got to maybe work more 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=279)   deeply or maybe you can just help me. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=283)   Probably, the strategies that you are using are already optimal. 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=292)   That's my guess. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=294)   It's simply a matter of continuing with them. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=298)   But let's just do some interactive stuff and we'll see what comes up. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=301)   I'm not sure that there's actually anything new to add content-wise. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=310)   It may just be a numbers game of continuing what you're now doing. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=315)   But like I say, let's see what happens. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=318)   I do have a couple more questions. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=322)   Does the tension reaction that you're referring to, does that tend to come up in a pronounced 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=332)   pattern in real time or is it more of an ongoing sort of situation? 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=342)   By that I mean, is there a clear sense of there'll be an eruption of feel and then there's 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=347)   a tension, eruption of feel, then there's tension? 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=351)   Or is it that the tension is sort of there in a fairly ongoing way? 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=360)   Or does it tend to fluctuate moment by moment with the fluctuations in the feel? 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=369)   A little bit of the second, a little bit of the third. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=372)   The feel is pretty continuous, pretty intense, but there is a rising and falling depending 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=378)   on if I'm able to give it, if I'm able to stop and go into it, sometimes it might multiply 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=385)   in effect times 10 and become quite more than what you wanted to deal with, but I'm assuming 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=394)   that's a part of the process. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=397)   Sometimes my work with it will help it flow. 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=402)   The tension does not correspond directly to the feel and what I'm calling the tension 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=409)   is just from the feel having been so consistent, there's a kind of a not breathing and a tensing 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=416)   in that's creating stuff in the back. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=419)   So it's not really a moment by moment physical muscle tensing around emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=428)   It's more the result that the emotional body sensations have been ongoing for so long that 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=433)   you're getting this secondary sensation. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=436)   Okay, now let me ask some other questions. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=442)   You talk about the feel breaking up into flow and I'm assuming that happens with some consistency? 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=451)   You know, whenever I focus in on it, yes. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=454)   How about the tension reaction? 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=456)   Does it break up into flow? 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=459)   If I'm focusing towards that, yes. 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=463)   That can break up into flow as well. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=465)   They all do kind of like a rubber band snap back into place a lot. 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=472)   It just feels like there's just been a momentum of... 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=474)   Okay, they break up into flow but then they can re-solidify. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=478)   So you can actually have the tension and the feel both turn into flow with your practice. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=488)   Have you attempted to do that during practice in motion like walking practice and so forth? 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=495)   Pretty much, yes. 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=497)   I have to, otherwise I wouldn't be able to function. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=501)   I wouldn't be doing this today if I wasn't. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=504)   So you can already get them both to dissolve into flow which is pretty amazing. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=509)   But when I'm doing an action, in other words if I'm stopping and all of my awareness is 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=515)   going into that, I can go total flow. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=518)   But when I have to also do this activity or talk to this person or do something like that, 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=525)   all of my attention isn't on it. 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=527)   So there's some congealing. 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=530)   I can do enough flow to function but I'm not floating on clouds all the way through. 
<br>[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=541)   I do have periods where something like there's certain activities that help the flow. 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=548)   So when I'm doing a laughing meditation or when I'm facilitating somebody, I literally 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=556)   don't, it pretty much all goes flow during certain activities. 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=562)   But the rest of the time it's having to kind of keep some awareness there and some awareness 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=568)   here just to kind of function. 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=570)   A couple more questions, which is the source of the greatest distress? 
<br>[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=582)   Is it the feel or the tension reaction? 
<br>[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=585)   The feel, absolutely. 
<br>[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=587)   So you're not so concerned with dealing with the tension reaction? 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=590)   Oh that'll go when the feel... 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=593)   So the core issue is intensity of activation of emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=599)   Absolutely. 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=600)   And I think that helps me hone in a little bit more on what our target should be. 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=607)   Have you attempted, well I should say as you know, a basic principle in mindfulness is 
<br>[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=614)   divide and conquer. 
<br>[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=616)   Case in point, you have divided this experience into, okay there's the emotional body sensations, 
<br>[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=623)   that's one component, then there's the muscle reactions to those, that's the second component. 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=628)   So that's already a divide and conquer and that has already given you some relief that 
<br>[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=634)   the average person wouldn't experience under comparable circumstances. 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=641)   As you remember, a second axiom is if divide and conquer doesn't work, remember what I 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=649)   always say, subdivide until you do conquer. 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=652)   In this case, have you attempted to break the feel into specific flavors, anger, fear, 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=659)   sadness, in other words, have you applied the... 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=665)   Noting feeling flavors. 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=666)   Noting feeling flavor technique to this intense arising. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=670)   Yes, I have. 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=672)   What I have found to be more helpful is the investigating where exactly I'm feeling what. 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=685)   Okay, it's a clenching here, what are the boundaries, is there more pressure in, is 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=690)   it pushing out, you know, am I coming down. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=694)   The more I'm kind of investigating it without necessarily putting a label of the quality, 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=700)   that's been a little more successful in helping me go through it. 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=705)   But I can tell you the quality. 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=707)   The subdivide principle can be applied with regards to either the quality, which is the 
<br>[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=715)   noting feel flavors, so that gives you the spectrum, anger, fear, sadness, interest, 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=719)   what have you. 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=721)   But the subdivide principle can also be applied to the spatial aspect of things. 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=728)   So then that would be like... 
<br>[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=730)   You want to stop for one second? 
<br>[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=731)   No, let's just let it go. 
<br>[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=732)   Okay. 
<br>[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=733)   It could happen during a real session. 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=738)   So you can subdivide into flavors, but you can also subdivide into locations. 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=746)   So it's an application of the same principle. 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=749)   So you're saying that subdividing it by individual body locations has turned out to be more productive. 
<br>[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=757)   Yeah, location and quality of sensation. 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=762)   You mean, so it's a little of both? 
<br>[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=765)   Yes. 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=766)   Flavor and location, you're getting specific about those. 
<br>[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=770)   So you've already made the major thing that I would first try, okay, because you've internalized 
<br>[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=779)   the algorithm so well, and you say that that does help. 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=783)   Do you note the location, like with the location word, face? 
<br>[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=787)   No, I haven't been doing that out loud. 
<br>[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=789)   But you've been tracking the location, and then it sounds like you're staying up for 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=794)   a little while in a location. 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=797)   And moving my awareness around inside of it. 
<br>[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=801)   Inventory, and see what it's like. 
<br>[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=803)   When I'm inside of it, it's so much easier than when I'm outside of it, for me. 
<br>[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=809)   So that, once again, sounds like a pretty optimal strategy. 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=815)   Tell me, what are the range of flavors involved? 
<br>[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=818)   It's primarily a fear flavor, primarily to an almost terror panic. 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=827)   Intense fear? 
<br>[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=828)   Intense fear, and there's absolutely sadness. 
<br>[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=831)   There's absolutely... 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=832)   Fear and sadness. 
<br>[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=833)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=834)   Is there a reason for it, or is it just erupting in the body? 
<br>[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=841)   Like I said, I think there was an event or two that triggered it on the outside, but 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=846)   this was out of proportion to that, and I saw that. 
<br>[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=849)   And as I worked with it, I found that the particular story, the surface story... 
<br>[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=858)   I even knew, it was silly. 
<br>[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=861)   But as I let go of there needing to be a story, I kind of just went into this huge feel. 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=868)   And as I've gone down in layers, I'm seeing kind of flickers of like, oh, fear of annihilation, 
<br>[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=876)   that I'll be killed in any moment. 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=877)   There's not a logical thing to this. 
<br>[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=879)   Yeah, right. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=880)   In other words, it's not really coming from the object of external or... 
<br>[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=884)   I think it tapped, I think whatever this was on the outside... 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=888)   The pool of fear. 
<br>[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=889)   It tapped everything like a magnet, I think it drew everything up that resonated at that 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=894)   frequency, and it's just kind of really thrown me at how huge it is. 
<br>[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=900)   And they say in Ohio, huge, you're supposed to say huge. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=904)   But really, it's taken all my technique or skill to be functioning. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=913)   Okay. 
<br>[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=914)   So we're having a huge upwelling of fear potential and it sounds like sadness. 
<br>[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=923)   Yeah, there's sadness. 
<br>[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=924)   And are they equally strong, the fear and the sadness? 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=929)   I'd say the fear is probably, it's probably like the fear is the cake and the sadness 
<br>[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=936)   is icing that's also going down through the cake. 
<br>[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=938)   I get it. 
<br>[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=939)   To use a food analogy. 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=941)   Actually, that's probably a pretty accurate description because that's what happens, they 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=946)   tangle and interact. 
<br>[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=951)   And you say very little mental image or internal talk accompanying this. 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=956)   At first there was a lot, but as I go down... 
<br>[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=959)   It's almost pure body. 
<br>[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=961)   How about very subtle image or talk activation, subliminal, a hint of something? 
<br>[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=967)   The subliminal stuff is where that annihilation came up. 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=971)   Okay, that is starting to suggest some strategies. 
<br>[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=976)   Let me ask you further. 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=980)   I say annihilation, but the thing that comes up would be killed, like anybody at any moment 
<br>[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=986)   could kill me. 
<br>[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=987)   Yeah, yeah. 
<br>[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=988)   It's phobic. 
<br>[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=989)   It's fear. 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=990)   And this is good. 
<br>[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=992)   You've heard me a million times talk about how before we break through these things, 
<br>[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=999)   they need to become, my phrase is, continuous and ubiquitous. 
<br>[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1004)   Continuous means unbroken in time, ubiquitous means everywhere in the body. 
<br>[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1009)   We're going towards that. 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1011)   If that's happening, then a process of permanent purification is happening. 
<br>[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1020)   People, of course, are averse to the notion of letting something like fear or sadness 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1029)   become continuous through time and omnidirectional in the body, ubiquitous through the body. 
<br>[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1037)   But that's penny wise and pound foolish, because being unwilling to pass through that temporarily 
<br>[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1043)   keeps them always with the sort of Damocles of fear hanging over their head, and likewise 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1051)   with the other negatives like sadness, anger, and so forth. 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1054)   So you have to reach a point where it's completely irrational, completely over the top intense, 
<br>[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1062)   doesn't stop in time, and is in every cubic centimeter of your body, if not of the known 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1069)   universe, in other words, perceived as larger than the body. 
<br>[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1078)   And say, okay, I would allow this to go on forever. 
<br>[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1083)   It's at that point that you're getting optimal catharsis, in the sense of cleaning out. 
<br>[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1090)   So it's taking a while, but I'm getting a clearer picture of what's going on. 
<br>[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1094)   Just hearing you say that makes me feel better. 
<br>[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1096)   You know, I mean, I still want to work, but it's kind of just helpful to have somebody 
<br>[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1103)   say, because I've just been working on it by myself without talking to anyone, and it's 
<br>[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1109)   very helpful to hear it. 
<br>[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1110)   It's just helpful to hear that, you know. 
<br>[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1113)   Yeah, I would say that this is the stage before people become free. 
<br>[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1120)   It's interesting too, because when I had a physical issue a year ago, where I had excruciating 
<br>[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1129)   pain in my body, what happened was it felt like my skin all over my body was burned, 
<br>[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1135)   was singeing, very hot. 
<br>[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1137)   And the neurologist and everybody said it was probably in response to the pain. 
<br>[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1141)   They said it's just your body's into an alarm alert mode. 
<br>[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1144)   That's getting activated by this fear. 
<br>[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1147)   So like I have that in addition, so you're talking about hot, you know. 
<br>[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1153)   I've got that on the outside, this kind of singeing, and that will definitely, that directly 
<br>[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1160)   corresponds with the intensity of the feeling. 
<br>[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1164)   So that's enough, isn't it? 
<br>[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1168)   It's a lot to work with, but actually I need a little more information. 
<br>[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1175)   Do you think that it's interacting with subtle levels of talk or image? 
<br>[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1185)   Very very subtle, subliminal. 
<br>[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1186)   What do you mean, interacting? 
<br>[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1188)   By that I mean that the fear and sadness might be intensified by subtle subliminal activations 
<br>[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1202)   of visual or auditory thinking. 
<br>[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1206)   What I think is happening, and this is just having been working with it now for a while, 
<br>[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1212)   I think it's like if there's a deck of cards that's all the images and thoughts that we 
<br>[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1217)   have in a pool, that one hit something and it went down, and if there were like little 
<br>[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1223)   shavings of metal, I'm sorry, I went back away from deck of cards, little shavings, 
<br>[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1227)   all of those came up, and each one of those is an image or it could be image or talk stuff, 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1233)   but it's just like, and so you might get little flicks like of popcorn, but it might not be 
<br>[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1238)   enough to go, oh yes, that's when I was fired. 
<br>[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1242)   That's exactly what I mean by that. 
<br>[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1243)   And when that comes up, it can poke, it can, it can, it can kind of like add a little bit 
<br>[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1250)   of a wood shaving to the fire, but it's like the feel called that up and then that might 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1258)   poke in the feel a little bit, but if I stay with the feel, they just kind of hang out. 
<br>[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1264)   So the answer to the question is yes, there is interaction with subtle image, which is 
<br>[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1272)   significant and also characteristic of catharsis, although it may primarily come up as body 
<br>[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1280)   feel flavors, subliminal auditory and visual thinking often enters into the gestalt, especially 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1290)   the visual, because people don't usually hear hell, they usually see hell, although in theory 
<br>[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1299)   you can hear it too, but image space is where the monsters are that might be linked to all 
<br>[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1307)   of this, so that gives me some of the more information that I need. 
<br>[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1313)   Okay now, believe it or not, yet more questions, okay, because well, because we got to see 
<br>[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1318)   what's really going on and I don't... 
<br>[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1321)   You're doing your house. 
<br>[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1322)   Yeah, well, you interviewed me. 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1323)   You're doing your house, MD. 
<br>[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1324)   This is called differential diagnosis, baby. 
<br>[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1329)   These are my huge diagnostic skills. 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1335)   Okay, so let's see here. 
<br>[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1344)   Have you ever had the experience of having strong fear that was pervasive through the 
<br>[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1351)   body so dissolved into flow that it no longer caused you suffering? 
<br>[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1359)   Yes. 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1360)   How about sadness? 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1363)   Have you ever done that? 
<br>[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1365)   So then you've already done what we're going to be working towards. 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1368)   We're going to be working towards that experience yet again, because it's a matter of, I mean 
<br>[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1377)   basically, what, let's see, one, two, three, four, maybe there's four kinds of human beings. 
<br>[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1387)   I mean there's a lot of ways to classify humans, right? 
<br>[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1392)   But maybe one way to classify all human beings is there's most human beings who have never 
<br>[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1400)   had the experience of physical pain flowing so completely that it turned into a flavor 
<br>[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1408)   of catharsis rather than a flavor of suffering. 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1411)   Most humans have never had that experience, okay? 
<br>[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1414)   So that's most humans. 
<br>[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1416)   Then there are the humans that have at least had that experience once, okay? 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1425)   Then there are the humans that have had that same experience but with regards to rage, 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1433)   terror, or grief. 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1435)   That's a whole other thing than physical pain in terms of what it's like when that breaks 
<br>[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1441)   up. 
<br>[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1442)   So we've determined that- 
<br>[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1443)   And I think harder. 
<br>[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1445)   Incomparably harder. 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1447)   Because pain is just pain. 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1450)   The emotional sensations have been honed by evolution to grip us and control us and distort 
<br>[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1457)   us. 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1458)   They've been honed by evolution for that task. 
<br>[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1462)   That's what hell is. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1463)   Hell is rage, terror, grief, shame flavors that have become so activated that they're 
<br>[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1476)   able to convince you that not only will this be all you ever experience from now on, they're 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1483)   actually able to convince you that you never experienced anything else. 
<br>[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1487)   They have that much distorting power so that it seems like eternal in both directions. 
<br>[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1494)   That would be hell. 
<br>[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1499)   Purgatory is when you've experienced those sensations enough that they can't cause that 
<br>[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1506)   illusion anymore but they're still there and you're working with them. 
<br>[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1514)   The threshold between purgatory and heaven is when it turns into flow that we've been 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1524)   talking about. 
<br>[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1525)   So believe it or not, one other question. 
<br>[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1527)   Besides fear and sadness, are there hints of any other flavors in there? 
<br>[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1533)   Like anger or shame specifically. 
<br>[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1536)   I actually look specifically for them. 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1539)   I think the shame flavor can, like if something happens in the extra world that embarrasses 
<br>[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1549)   me, I feel that shame and that can trigger all this. 
<br>[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1553)   You know, it's irrational. 
<br>[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1554)   Is it part of the present gestalt, the shame flavor, or is it pretty much we're dealing 
<br>[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1560)   with sad and had? 
<br>[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1565)   If we call fear had. 
<br>[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1566)   Just for alliteration, I couldn't resist. 
<br>[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1570)   I know, I didn't go for it. 
<br>[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1574)   Because there's mad, sad, glad and had. 
<br>[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1577)   You're changing my feel favors here. 
<br>[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1580)   Don't worry, we'll get back to hell soon. 
<br>[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1585)   Here's what's interesting. 
<br>[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1588)   You know that heat I talked about in the body? 
<br>[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1591)   It shares territory with shame and embarrassment in terms of the flesh. 
<br>[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1597)   And so it can trigger it. 
<br>[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1601)   So they all kind of interlinked in that way. 
<br>[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1605)   It's all information that I need to do the guidance. 
<br>[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1610)   Let's do it. 
<br>[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1611)   Okay. 
<br>[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1612)   Okay. 
<br>[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1613)   So take a moment to stretch up and settle in and focus for just a second on physical 
<br>[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1619)   relaxation into the posture. 
<br>[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1629)   Okay, we're going to start by working in the fierce sad system. 
<br>[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1647)   So at any given instant, there'll be exactly one of four states. 
<br>[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1657)   Just fear, just sad, both or neither. 
<br>[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1661)   We're going to ignore everything else. 
<br>[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1663)   We're just going to penetrate that one system of affective somesthesia. 
<br>[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1670)   My way of talking make sense? 
<br>[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1671)   Well, until the last two words. 
<br>[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1673)   I know what you meant. 
<br>[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1674)   I know. 
<br>[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1675)   That's Greco-Roman for emotional type body sensation. 
<br>[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1682)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1683)   I love it though. 
<br>[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1684)   I know. 
<br>[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1685)   So I'd like you to note fear, sad, fear and sad, or none. 
<br>[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1696)   One of those four. 
<br>[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1697)   You want fear and sad or both? 
<br>[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1699)   Let's use fear and sad with a Boolean and operation. 
<br>[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1705)   So we'll get the four logically possible states of the fierce sadness system. 
<br>[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1714)   Any questions about that? 
<br>[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1716)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1718)   Out loud? 
<br>[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1719)   Yeah, for starters. 
<br>[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1723)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1727)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1732)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1737)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1743)   Fear and sad. 
<br>[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1744)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1745)   Now go to mental labels. 
<br>[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1748)   Thinking the labels rather than speaking them. 
<br>[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1757)   Okay. 
<br>[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1783)   Is it still mostly both at the same time? 
<br>[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1786)   Yes. 
<br>[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1787)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1788)   Now we're going to work just with the fear. 
<br>[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1797)   I'm assuming that there is one or more areas of local intensity for the fear. 
<br>[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1803)   Is that correct? 
<br>[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1804)   Yes. 
<br>[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1805)   Is it one or are there several disconnected? 
<br>[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1809)   There's probably one primary one that spreads out and has little branches to it. 
<br>[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1815)   And then there's a little bit of a journey to a secondary one for the most part. 
<br>[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1821)   Okay. 
<br>[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1822)   So the primary one spreads branches. 
<br>[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1826)   How broadly? 
<br>[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1827)   The primary one is right at the center of my chest, like right in between my rib cage. 
<br>[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1833)   How broadly are the branches spread through the body? 
<br>[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1840)   It kind of comes down around to the side and in there, but it kind of spreads out a bit 
<br>[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1847)   like the core, the center is kind of there in a kind of big odd shape. 
<br>[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1854)   And then there are ways in which I think it kind of reaches subtly, like subtle veins 
<br>[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1860)   kind of going out around to the middle of my back. 
<br>[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1865)   Okay. 
<br>[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1866)   Excellent detection skill. 
<br>[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1868)   I'm assuming that the subtler ramifications are of less intensity? 
<br>[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1874)   Absolutely. 
<br>[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1875)   Here's what we're going to do. 
<br>[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1879)   We're going to just work with fear. 
<br>[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1880)   Each time you note sad, I would like you to zoom out to the subtle ramifications, focus 
<br>[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1887)   on them only. 
<br>[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1888)   Every time I note sad? 
<br>[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1890)   I'm sorry, every time you note fear. 
<br>[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1892)   Go out to the subtle ramifications and work towards perfect equanimity with those subtle 
<br>[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1898)   sensations because they're subtle, it may be possible to have complete openness with 
<br>[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1903)   them even though you can't do so with the local intensities that are at the epicenter 
<br>[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1909)   of it. 
<br>[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1910)   So we're going to use the zoom out option on the noting. 
<br>[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1914)   You're going to zoom out to cover the subtle spread and work towards perfect equanimity 
<br>[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1923)   with that. 
<br>[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1924)   And don't concern yourself with the local splash at the center at all. 
<br>[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1929)   Just with the global ripple in a rhythm with the mental labels of fear. 
<br>[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1934)   The word fear. 
<br>[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1938)   Any questions about that? 
<br>[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1940)   No. 
<br>[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1941)   You want me... 
<br>[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1942)   I'll just repeat it back. 
<br>[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1944)   I'm zooming out. 
<br>[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1945)   I'm going to keep noting fear with mental labels, but I'm going to, when I note fear, 
<br>[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1950)   zoom out to the subtler tributaries, so to speak, of the experience of fear in my body, 
<br>[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1961)   not tuning into the big main Grand Central Station part of it. 
<br>[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1968)   That's perfect. 
<br>[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1969)   Okay. 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1970)   And yes, and by mental label I mean think to word fear to indicate that that's the flavor. 
<br>[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1977)   And then you zoom out. 
<br>[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1979)   And then I'm just going to have you do that on your own for a few minutes. 
<br>[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1982)   Okay. 
<br>[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=1983)   And then I'm going to have you do that on your own for a few minutes. 
<br>[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2008)   Able to do that pretty good? 
<br>[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2028)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2030)   Is there any hint of flow in the global spread of the fear? 
<br>[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2037)   Oh, yeah. 
<br>[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2038)   It's pretty fluid? 
<br>[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2039)   Yeah, it flows. 
<br>[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2040)   It's interesting. 
<br>[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2041)   I tend to be flowy in general, but when I worked with this, it would... 
<br>[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2050)   At first I got little hits of nausea. 
<br>[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2053)   Like I started to feel a little nausea. 
<br>[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2054)   Other flavors. 
<br>[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2055)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2056)   And then a little ticklish, but if I just kind of kept with it, those would just... 
<br>[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2063)   You know, if I just kind of just stayed with them. 
<br>[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2065)   Yes, they dissipate. 
<br>[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2066)   So you're able to get the global component in the fear flavor to flow. 
<br>[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2072)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2073)   Okay. 
<br>[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2074)   Can that flow spread into the local intensity so that you get a local global flow with the 
<br>[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2082)   fear? 
<br>[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2083)   You know, I think I started to naturally start to do that, and I think that's when the nausea 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2087)   started to... 
<br>[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2088)   I think my body... 
<br>[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2089)   Okay, let's go for local global flow now. 
<br>[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2092)   So that means you'll remember that there's, in my standard formulation of the noting technique, 
<br>[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2097)   you remember zoom in, zoom out, zoom both ways. 
<br>[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2101)   So we're going to zoom both ways, out to the perimeter, to the weak sensations there, and 
<br>[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2107)   ride the momentum of the flow that's there, and simultaneously zoom into the core intensity 
<br>[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2114)   and see if you can get them to get that local splash, global ripple. 
<br>[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2121)   While keeping the zooming, so simultaneously... 
<br>[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2124)   Yeah, you're zooming in and out, into the core, out to the perimeter, and you're doing 
<br>[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2129)   that precisely to facilitate the spread of the global flow into the local intensity. 
<br>[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2141)   So the awareness is moving in and out. 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2144)   In and out at the same time. 
<br>[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2147)   You have a phrase that you came up with. 
<br>[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2149)   Sliding. 
<br>[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2150)   You're going to slide in both ways. 
<br>[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2151)   You're going to slide out with your awareness and let it facilitate a global circulation 
<br>[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2158)   of fear, and you're going to slide in and let that facilitate a local circulation of 
<br>[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2165)   fear. 
<br>[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2166)   So you get both the intense areas and the peripheral areas as a single fear flow. 
<br>[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2186)   Able to get a little sense of that? 
<br>[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2201)   Oh yeah. 
<br>[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2203)   So that's a catharsis, a releasing of fear. 
<br>[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2208)   It creates this kind of center of this, it's kind of a deep joy that kind of comes up the 
<br>[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2216)   center, but then I get really hot. 
<br>[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2219)   Yeah, let the joy be there, let the heat be there. 
<br>[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2222)   These are all reactions to the catharsis. 
<br>[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2227)   And if the heat produces more fear, then just dissipate that in the fear. 
<br>[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2233)   Except that we're going to let go of the fear now and go to the sadness. 
<br>[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2238)   Have to be a rocket scientist to figure out what we're going to do. 
<br>[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2241)   Same procedure, start with the periphery of the sadness flavor. 
<br>[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2247)   Work with that. 
<br>[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2249)   See if it's amenable through a zoom out process to an experience of a global flow in the sadness. 
<br>[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2260)   If that's feasible, do that, and then go in and look for the local flow in the epicenter, 
<br>[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2268)   and you're going to get a local global flow in the sadness, if indeed that's sort of doable 
<br>[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2274)   at this time. 
<br>[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2275)   I'd like you to explore the doability of that with regards to sadness. 
<br>[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2281)   Just give it some time. 
<br>[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2303)   Ever able to get a little hint of that? 
<br>[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2307)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2309)   Since the sadness doesn't have the same vein network of spread, I just kind of instead 
<br>[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2315)   of, since I didn't quite have the subtle area, I just went around the boundaries of it. 
<br>[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2321)   That's exactly correct. 
<br>[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2322)   That corresponds to the subtle. 
<br>[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2324)   It's just less widespread. 
<br>[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2326)   That was a good move. 
<br>[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2327)   I just made the boundaries soft and then treated that like... 
<br>[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2330)   That's right. 
<br>[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2331)   That's what I would have had you do. 
<br>[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2332)   So you're able to get a little sense of that. 
<br>[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2334)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2335)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2336)   Now, I'm going to have you do a fairly intricate concentration, where you're going to attempt 
<br>[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2351)   to experience simultaneously a kind of river of fear and a kind of river of sad that flow 
<br>[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2365)   through each other, interpenetrating without interfering. 
<br>[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2372)   So it's almost like... 
<br>[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2373)   Could you say that again? 
<br>[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2374)   Oh yeah. 
<br>[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2375)   Right. 
<br>[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2376)   There's the sadness flavor and it's a sort of like giant liquid drop that's sort of expanding 
<br>[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2384)   and contracting, right? 
<br>[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2385)   Right. 
<br>[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2386)   And there's the fear flavor and it's a giant liquid drop doing the same essential dance. 
<br>[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2391)   Right. 
<br>[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2392)   Now, you know how in a ghost movie, you see that the ghost can walk through the wall, 
<br>[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2403)   right? 
<br>[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2404)   Right. 
<br>[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2405)   The ghost passes through the wall, the wall gives no resistance. 
<br>[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2408)   Right. 
<br>[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2409)   Now, imagine you didn't have a ghost and a wall, but you had two ghosts and they were 
<br>[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2415)   both doing their own thing, but they could pass through each other without disturbing 
<br>[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2423)   each other. 
<br>[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2424)   Right. 
<br>[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2425)   When they occupied the same place at the same time. 
<br>[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2430)   So you're going to have these two ghostly waves, one flavored fear, the other flavor 
<br>[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2435)   sad. 
<br>[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2436)   And they're sort of dancing, except unlike physical dancers, parts of them, even all 
<br>[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2442)   of them can occupy the same place. 
<br>[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2448)   So they're constantly waving and the waves pass through each other without disturbing 
<br>[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2455)   each other, without developing pressure areas where they would clash. 
<br>[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2460)   Does this metaphor make sense? 
<br>[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2463)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2464)   Have you attempted to do this with the fear and sad? 
<br>[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2468)   Not in this, not this round. 
<br>[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2470)   This may be the part of the missing piece because you could get them individually to 
<br>[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2477)   flow, but then the next step is collectively to flow. 
<br>[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2481)   Because if they both flow at the same time, interpenetrating wherever they need to without 
<br>[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2486)   interfering, then they won't multiply together into overwhelm. 
<br>[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2495)   And so the ability to have more than one flavor and to separate the flavors, have all the 
<br>[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2503)   flavors flow, and then have the flow fields interpenetrate without interference is a sequence 
<br>[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2509)   that I take people through when they're going through big challenges that are polychromatic 
<br>[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2522)   body distress, meaning a lot of different colors in the body. 
<br>[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2527)   Then we need to train the colors to flow through each other. 
<br>[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2530)   Through each other. 
<br>[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2531)   It's an interesting. 
<br>[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2532)   In this ghostly dance. 
<br>[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2533)   It's an interesting intimacy between them. 
<br>[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2538)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2539)   It's like they're dancing through each other as well as with each other. 
<br>[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2544)   And to the extent that they're both flowing, you'll get an even more powerful flavor of 
<br>[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2551)   purification and hopefully a significantly deeper sense of relief. 
<br>[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2611)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2622)   How's that coming? 
<br>[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2625)   Good. 
<br>[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2626)   Good. 
<br>[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2627)   Good in what sense? 
<br>[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2632)   When I can allow them both to share the same space and I'm recognizing how I've been keeping 
<br>[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2643)   them separate and keeping that line between them and when I allow them to just kind of 
<br>[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2649)   do that, the kind of joy I talked about before with the fear, it's a very intense version 
<br>[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2657)   of that and then it kind of seems to ignite this PT-like energy up the body and it gets 
<br>[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2663)   very hot. 
<br>[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2664)   So you're getting hot and rapturous with fear and sadness. 
<br>[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2670)   Yes, I am. 
<br>[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2671)   Which most people would say is rather counterintuitive, but your facial expression proves it. 
<br>[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2679)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2680)   Okay, good. 
<br>[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2681)   It's really interesting though because as it does, I find myself wanting to comment 
<br>[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2685)   on it and I'll go off and talk and then it loses it a little bit. 
<br>[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2692)   Yeah, and you have to come back. 
<br>[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2693)   It's got to be done purely in the budget. 
<br>[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2695)   It's because the comments and then, you know... 
<br>[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2699)   It does trigger some little topics to go, this is all about it. 
<br>[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2703)   That's right, but your use of practice allows you to stop that and not sort of go down in 
<br>[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2708)   that. 
<br>[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2709)   Yeah, well plus there's motivation to kind of stay with this. 
<br>[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2714)   It's intrinsically rewarding. 
<br>[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2716)   Now next step, see if you can have the fear and the sadness dancing with and through each 
<br>[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2723)   other with your eyes open. 
<br>[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2726)   And you may find defocusing the eyes initially helpful. 
<br>[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2735)   So we can maintain it somewhat into a more ordinary experience. 
<br>[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2742)   It's interesting when I am, as I kind of go in and out here as I do it, and I'm going 
<br>[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2754)   to talk while keeping my eyes open, but I'm getting to where I'm honing in on the one 
<br>[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2762)   specific place in the body they both share in a powerful way. 
<br>[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2767)   And if I can just kind of keep track of flow there, letting it be, whether it's the red 
<br>[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2772)   or blue, you know, it kind of helps me maintain it with my eyes open more. 
<br>[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2780)   Good. 
<br>[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2782)   Now see if you can keep some contact with that even after we make some eye contact. 
<br>[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2791)   It may be a little trickier, but this is what we just did here is probably one of the missing 
<br>[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2802)   pieces of the solution to the situation that you described. 
<br>[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2809)   I'm not sure it's all of the missing pieces. 
<br>[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2811)   I've got a few other ideas besides this. 
<br>[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2817)   But I think for this session, one. 
<br>[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2820)   One epiphany is worth the price of admission. 
<br>[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2824)   A little bit of money on the table. 
<br>[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2832)   You haven't done this before, this theme of different flavors. 
<br>[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2837)   Interdigitation was a word you used to use. 
<br>[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2840)   And what's so interesting is as soon as you guided me on this, I thought, I'll guide somebody 
<br>[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2845)   else in this. 
<br>[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2846)   But I didn't think of it for me. 
<br>[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2851)   I was just too busy. 
<br>[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2852)   Oh, you remembered to do this. 
<br>[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2853)   You remember to get the flavors to do this. 
<br>[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2855)   Oh, I have other people do this. 
<br>[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2857)   Right, but you didn't remember that you could do it for yourself. 
<br>[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2860)   I was just, all my circuits were just so full, I guess. 
<br>[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2864)   Well, you know, that goes to a very general principle in the way I set up my approach 
<br>[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2870)   to meditation, which is that the assumption is that when people face real challenges, 
<br>[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2881)   even people without a background in practice, if you interactively guide them, will be able 
<br>[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2886)   to have pretty dramatic experiences pretty consistently. 
<br>[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2890)   Dramatic, positive experiences. 
<br>[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2895)   It has also been my experience that people that are quite good at meditation, when they're 
<br>[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2901)   faced with real life challenges, can easily forget. 
<br>[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2905)   But all you need is somebody to do this. 
<br>[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2907)   And it's like, oh yeah, I knew how to do that. 
<br>[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2912)   And then now you're set. 
<br>[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2914)   This is one session. 
<br>[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2916)   We don't need 20 years of therapy here. 
<br>[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2918)   It's like, okay, now you sort of know what to do. 
<br>[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2922)   So I think that's excellent. 
<br>[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2925)   But I will, for subsequent sessions, remind me that I had some other ideas of, well I 
<br>[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2933)   can actually just tell you. 
<br>[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2934)   Just tell me now and then I can always replay it and go, remember you had this and this. 
<br>[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2938)   So the other thing is that, okay, one missing piece was, well, the two flavors have to simultaneously 
<br>[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2945)   flow and through each other. 
<br>[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2948)   Another possible missing piece is that you're getting significant interaction with subliminal 
<br>[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2957)   thinking. 
<br>[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2958)   And you might want to look in that direction. 
<br>[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2963)   And the way you look in that direction, what I was going to have you work with is a special 
<br>[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2968)   exercise that, with all the years we've done, I'm not sure we've ever done this one, but 
<br>[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2974)   I'll ask you. 
<br>[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2975)   Have we ever done noting feel sources? 
<br>[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2980)   What that means is, I have you note if there's no fear, you say no fear. 
<br>[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2985)   If there is fear but it's not triggered by anything you're aware of, you say just fear. 
<br>[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2991)   And then you specify if the fear has been triggered by fear from image, fear from talk, 
<br>[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=2997)   fear from sound, fear from sight, or fear from touch. 
<br>[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3001)   No, we haven't done that. 
<br>[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3003)   We've mentioned fear, I call that noting feel sources. 
<br>[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3006)   And feel can be generic or specific. 
<br>[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3011)   That was the next thing I had in the hopper to try after this, because what may be happening 
<br>[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3016)   is that you're getting significant triggering from other senses that are activating the 
<br>[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3024)   fear in real time. 
<br>[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3026)   And usually what, you know how I always say, okay, what is science in a nutshell? 
<br>[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3031)   How much of what, when, and where, interacting in what ways, and changing at what rates? 
<br>[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3037)   Typically I emphasize the what, the where, and the rates of change. 
<br>[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3047)   But some of the special techniques are designed to elucidate the interactions, specifically 
<br>[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3054)   what's triggering what. 
<br>[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3056)   And I find that when people are going through significant intractable fear experiences, 
<br>[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3062)   or emotion in general, but especially fear, literally a few minutes of noting what is 
<br>[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3070)   triggering that fear in terms of the broad sensory categories. 
<br>[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3076)   So we can now detect no fear, fear but not triggered by anything, okay, no fear, fear, 
<br>[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3084)   fear from image, fear from talk, and especially subtle image and subtle talk, the subliminal 
<br>[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3090)   stuff. 
<br>[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3091)   The way you know that's happening is you get a tug towards image space or a tug towards 
<br>[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3096)   talk space, no content awareness at all, but the next instant there's a spike in the fear 
<br>[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3102)   in the body. 
<br>[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3104)   Now you know that the subconscious mind... 
<br>[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3105)   I'm quite aware of having that. 
<br>[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3107)   Yeah, the subconscious. 
<br>[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3108)   Well it turns out if you ask yourself, if you constrain yourself in real time to know 
<br>[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3114)   did it come from image, talk, sight, sound, or the physicality of the body, because it's 
<br>[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3119)   got to be one of those five, that keeping track of the whole system, somehow that vastly 
<br>[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azg0BrD9jGU&t=3129)   reduces the overwhelm.
