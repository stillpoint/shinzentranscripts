title: "How Continuity of Practice Will Help you Catch Fire ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=0)   I'd like to start with just a couple practical suggestions in terms of getting the most out 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=29)   of the retreat. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=32)   I like to distinguish formal practice from what I call practice in life. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=42)   By formal practice I mean a situation where you're attempting to maintain a continuity 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=50)   of technique of some sort. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=56)   It could be done in stillness, seated, standing, lying down, or it could be done in motion, 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=66)   simple motion or more complex motions, exercise kind of motions, even doing tasks, those kinds 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=74)   of things. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=75)   But what characterizes formal practice is that it's all about maintaining whatever that 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=84)   technique is. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=86)   If it's a technique that involves noting, then you're continually noting unbroken. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=94)   By way of contrast, in daily life often it's not feasible to do that. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=102)   We have to take care of business, we have to allocate time and energy to think about 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=112)   stuff and to deal with situations. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=115)   So we typically in daily life can't have most of our energy focused on maintaining a continuity 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=126)   of technique intentionally. 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=129)   Of course, as you know, I define mindful awareness practices as practices that significantly 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=136)   elevate your base level of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=140)   I define base level of mindfulness to mean how mindful a person is under ordinary circumstances 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=148)   when they're not particularly trying to be mindful. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=152)   So as a result of practice, your base level of mindfulness should be elevated. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=158)   Even when you're just sort of bopping around taking care of business, thinking about this, 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=164)   talking about that, over the months, years, decades of practice, you should notice that 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=171)   just on autopilot you're much more mindful, even though you aren't necessarily intentionally 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=178)   trying to implement a technique. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=181)   So for daily life, what I encourage is something that I call, quote, practice in life, which 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=188)   means that when it's feasible, 30 seconds here, 3 minutes there, you implement a formal 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=195)   technique. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=196)   When it's feasible means, well, you get a little hiatus. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=202)   Maybe you're an office worker, you have to sit there, you have to think, plan, have meetings, 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=207)   etc. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=208)   But then you walk to the washroom or you're in a meeting where your full attention is 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=213)   not really required. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=214)   And it's like, okay, I'm going to do a few minutes of practice here, I'm going to do 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=221)   a few minutes of practice there. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=223)   And so you pepper the day with little micro hits. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=227)   I usually encourage people to have at least a half dozen, as I say, in daily life, under 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=235)   ordinary circumstances, at least a half dozen little hits like that during the day where 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=245)   it's feasible, you're in a simple situation, you're waiting or what have you. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=250)   Okay, now I'm going to do a technique and then just go back to taking care of business. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=257)   Now, if you make a Herculean resolve to really implement a technique for those 30 seconds 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=266)   or for those 3 minutes, you can actually meditate retroactively. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=271)   I know that seems oxymoronic, meaning contradiction by nature. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=277)   Okay, oxymoron is something that is contradictory by nature. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=286)   Mindfulness is in the moment. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=287)   How can you possibly have retroactive mindfulness? 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=290)   Well, here's what I mean by retroactive mindfulness. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=294)   As you're just bopping around taking care of business, not particularly implementing 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=298)   any intentional technique, you're stirring up the samskaras. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=305)   Now if you then stop on a dime and implement a practice, you can replace quantity with 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=318)   quality. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=319)   It takes a huge resolve to do that, though. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=322)   You have to really decide you're going to do that. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=325)   And then all those juices that got stimulated, that got stirred up as you were just being 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=331)   ordinary and not even remembering that you're a meditator necessarily, you can process all 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=338)   of that in 30 seconds or in 3 minutes if you really decide you're going to bring all you 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=345)   got to those few minutes of peppering the day. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=350)   So you sort of get, if you fully process the juices that got stirred up by ordinary life, 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=364)   then in a sense you meditated retroactively because you sort of, you've cleaned up or 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=374)   broken up forces that got stirred up as you were just going about life. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=381)   So practice, there's formal practice, continuity of technique, and then there's practice in 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=388)   life. 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=389)   And I divide formal practice into stillness and then in motion. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=394)   So success on this path is likely to happen if you alternate day-to-day practice with 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=405)   retreats. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=406)   So here we are at a retreat. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=409)   In day-to-day practice, there's a little bit of formal practice that you do. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=415)   Some people do an hour, some people do a half hour, some people do less. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=421)   There's a little bit of formal practice and then it's mostly, okay, just going about life 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=429)   and hopefully you'll remember to pepper it with life, with some practice during the day. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=435)   So on a retreat, it's a figure of reversal. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=440)   Basically what you should aim for is from the instant you wake up in the morning to 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=448)   the instant you lose consciousness at night, for the great majority of that time, you are 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=455)   doing formal practice. 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=458)   Either you're sitting or you're moving, and moving could be walking, it could be stretching, 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=464)   it could be taking a shower, it could be eating your meal. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=469)   But you try to maintain a continuity of practice. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=473)   The one exception to that, which would be more like a practice in life situation, is 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=478)   what we're doing right now. 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=482)   It's fine with me if you are entering formless samadhi as I'm talking and maintaining a formal 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=489)   practice and not listening to me in terms of content. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=494)   That's fine. 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=495)   But you may want to listen to some of this content also, in which case it's a little 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=500)   bit of going back and forth. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=503)   Or maybe you're mostly just listening to listen and it's just like ordinary things. 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=509)   So interviews, group process, that kind of stuff, that's a practice in life situation 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=519)   where you go in and out of technique as you wish. 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=523)   But other than those times, all the other times, chanting, waiting for me to get here, 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=532)   you know, what have you, putting your clothes on, taking a shower, try, if you can, to have 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=543)   a well-defined technique going. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=546)   What technique? 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=547)   It doesn't matter. 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=550)   Whatever appeals to you under different circumstances. 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=554)   There's sort of like two kinds of people on this planet. 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=562)   There's the way most people are, and then there are people that think about their day 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=569)   in terms of opportunities to cultivate and apply their mindfulness skills. 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=579)   It's just a whole different way to approach life. 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=584)   Many of you have probably read the Don Juan books, the Carlos Castaneda books, teachings 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=591)   of Don Juan and so forth. 
<br>[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=594)   If you haven't, there are these great classic, it was written by an anthropologist from UCLA 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=601)   who started to study a Yaqui Indian who lived in Arizona and in Mexico as an ethnographic 
<br>[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=611)   study and eventually, even though he was a scientist and a modern anthropologist, he 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=621)   actually got pulled into the cultural view of that Indian and stopped being an anthropologist 
<br>[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=631)   and became a shaman and wrote about it. 
<br>[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=637)   But anyway, the native teacher that he calls Don Juan, that's not the guy's real name, 
<br>[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=643)   but that person was not just a medicine person. 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=648)   It was not just a power healer kind of person. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=653)   It's absolutely evident, abundantly evident when you read that material that Don Juan 
<br>[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=662)   knows about impermanence, no self, and emptiness. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=670)   He has the liberated consciousness, which can result from those traditional practices 
<br>[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=677)   in some cases. 
<br>[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=678)   So the reason I'm mentioning this is there's a lot of incredible sound bites in those writings. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=691)   One of the things that Don Juan told Carlos was the ordinary person thinks about their 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=701)   life, everything in life, in terms of fortune and misfortune. 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=718)   But the person who sees thinks about everything that happens in life as an opportunity, a 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=729)   challenge, a challenge to apply and develop a certain state of consciousness. 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=742)   So becoming that kind of person that sort of thinks of life that way, you can still 
<br>[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=750)   acknowledge fortune and misfortune, but the day is more or less about cultivation. 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=760)   So that's really desirable. 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=762)   It's really desirable to become that kind of person. 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=768)   One of the Zen masters said that the average person is used 24 hours a day, but the person 
<br>[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=775)   of Zen uses 24 hours a day. 
<br>[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=778)   So on retreats, it's good if, other than the few times that we're sort of talking and interacting 
<br>[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=787)   and that kind of thing, other than that, I would strongly encourage you to attempt unbroken 
<br>[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=795)   formal practice. 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=797)   So basically the whole day is just one practice period. 
<br>[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=802)   I did a two month retreat many years ago with Upendita, who was Mahasi Sayadaw's sort of 
<br>[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=809)   heir apparent. 
<br>[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=812)   And this is a traditional Mahasi retreat. 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=815)   Some of you have done those kinds of retreats. 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=817)   You know, everything, and I mean everything, is done in slow motion. 
<br>[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=826)   And there's almost this, a little bit of one-upmanship, who could be the last person to get to the 
<br>[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=835)   dining hall? 
<br>[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=836)   Now mind you, the dining hall is only about 30 yards from the meditation hall. 
<br>[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=849)   And there were people that, you know, it was 45 minutes by the time I got there. 
<br>[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=861)   This is everything, okay? 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=862)   So it's a two month retreat, so you know, occasionally you have to do laundry or whatever. 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=868)   It's like, so you're doing your laundry in slow motion. 
<br>[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=870)   Two hours, do your laundry. 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=873)   And by the way, that's just three pairs of underpants. 
<br>[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=879)   So it's absolutely continuous practice. 
<br>[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=885)   Sit walk sit walk sit walk walk sit walk sit eat sit walk sit walk like that. 
<br>[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=891)   And that's all you do all day. 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=894)   They suggest that you sleep for four hours, so that leaves 20 hours of noting practice 
<br>[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=900)   to do every single day for two months. 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=903)   It's incredible. 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=905)   So just try to, as I say, try to keep things going and be that person that sort of strategizes. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=913)   Okay, chanting. 
<br>[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=914)   How am I going to focus? 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=918)   How, it's, you'll have a clear-cut strategy. 
<br>[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=921)   It could be a lot of things. 
<br>[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=923)   Maybe it's a focus out. 
<br>[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=924)   You're going to listen to the sound. 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=925)   You're going to merge with the sound. 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=929)   Or maybe you're going to merge with the physicality of the breathing of the chanting. 
<br>[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=936)   Or maybe it's a nurture positive. 
<br>[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=938)   After all, that's what chanting originally was. 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=941)   The mantras and so forth. 
<br>[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=944)   You did visualization. 
<br>[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=945)   You got the mantra going. 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=948)   Or maybe it's like a flow. 
<br>[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=951)   Or you're grok on how the chanting induces restful states. 
<br>[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=957)   Really a lot of our agitation is mental talk. 
<br>[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=965)   And either an internal or an external chanting kind of thing. 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=974)   The mental talk tends to go in all different directions. 
<br>[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=977)   But if you set up a kind of rhythm in talk space where you're going, om mani padme hum, 
<br>[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=983)   om mani padme hum, over and over again. 
<br>[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=986)   So what that rhythm does is it's like a comb. 
<br>[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=992)   If your mind is like hair that wants to be a bad hair day and go in all directions, but 
<br>[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1001)   you're constantly combing through it these tines of om mani padme hum, these syllables, 
<br>[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1007)   they make it difficult for the mind hair to fly in all different directions. 
<br>[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1014)   That's to induce a here rest experience relatively. 
<br>[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1018)   Even when your mind is wandering during chanting, you'll notice it can't wander as fast or as 
<br>[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1024)   big. 
<br>[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1025)   So you can go into see rest, hear rest, feel rest. 
<br>[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1028)   Or you can go into flow states. 
<br>[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1030)   There's a lot of possibilities. 
<br>[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1034)   Those of you that are familiar with the range of techniques. 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1038)   You sort of decide on how you want to do it. 
<br>[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1045)   This morning for myself, for example, I was doing expansion contraction. 
<br>[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1049)   Oh, it was so cool. 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1051)   It was in all three modalities, inner and outer. 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1054)   It's just the whole thing was just like simultaneously expanding, contracting. 
<br>[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1059)   It just sort of opened. 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1061)   That was like an interest, opportunity, necessity, right? 
<br>[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1065)   So it's like, okay, I think I'm going to go with this plan this morning. 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1069)   And like, okay, that's the strategy. 
<br>[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1072)   At other times, you might want to do other things. 
<br>[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1076)   So how am I going to practice when I'm taking a shower? 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1080)   Or when I'm doing my meal? 
<br>[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1082)   Fortunately, you get lots of chance to even get guidance specifically on that. 
<br>[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1088)   So that attitude of, okay, it's like, keep the continuity, I would strongly encourage 
<br>[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1099)   that. 
<br>[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1100)   But one of the metaphors that the Buddha used for success with practice is he compared it 
<br>[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1108)   to getting fire by rubbing sticks together, actually. 
<br>[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1113)   He said, in other words, it's an emphasis on continuity. 
<br>[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1120)   So if you rub and then you like stop, and then you rub and then you stop, well, it's 
<br>[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1125)   not going to develop something that catches fire. 
<br>[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1129)   So retreat is a situation where you can sort of catch fire with things by keeping a continuity 
<br>[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1137)   of practice going. 
<br>[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1139)   So that's something that I think would be good to consider and think about and try to 
<br>[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM-2w-0EMDU&t=1148)   achieve.
