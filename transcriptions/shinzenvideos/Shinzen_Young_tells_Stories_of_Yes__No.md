title: "Shinzen Young tells Stories of Yes & No"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=0)   So, there was a famous master in the Tang Dynasty that in Chinese is called Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=22)   His name is Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=24)   East Asia is a little confusing, you know, because there's four ways to pronounce every 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=31)   kanji, every Chinese character. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=35)   There's the Chinese way, and actually it varies depending on the part of China. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=40)   Then there's a Sino-Japanese, a Sino-Korean, and a Sino-Vietnamese. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=44)   So if you want to look up Zen masters, sometimes you find the name under the Japanese pronunciation, 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=52)   sometime under the Chinese. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=53)   So Zhao Zhou in Japanese is pronounced Zhou Shu. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=59)   A lot of people think, oh, that's the same as Sasaki, Zhou Shu, my teacher, but it's 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=66)   written with completely different characters. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=70)   Just happened to sound the same in Japanese. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=75)   So Zhao Zhou, or Zhou Shu in Japanese pronunciation, was actually one of the major Zen masters 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=85)   of the late Tang Dynasty. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=90)   He was a disciple of Master Nantran. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=98)   That's Nansen in Japanese pronunciation. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=104)   And Nantran was a disciple of one of the founders of Zen, Maazu, called Baso in Japanese. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=117)   Nantran is famous for a rather horrific piece of behavior if you were to take things literally. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=130)   But you know, these Zen stories, you cannot take literally, right? 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=136)   Remember they point, but they also hook. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=138)   The whole idea is to see what they point to, but not allow your fixations to get hooked 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=149)   by things. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=151)   So because when you hear this story, it's like, what? 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=156)   So I don't know if this story actually happened, okay? 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=160)   It's a little hard to imagine that it actually did happen, but it does point to something. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=171)   So this story involves Nantran, Nansen in Japanese pronunciation, and Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=177)   Zhao Zhou was Nantran's disciple. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=182)   So Zhao Zhou was out, and a dispute developed among Nantran's students. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=197)   The way that the temples were organized in those days is that there was an Eastern Hall 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=202)   and a Western Hall. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=204)   So the monks in the Eastern Hall and in the Western Hall got into an argument about who 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=211)   owned a cat. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=214)   This is pretty typical of the tempest and the teapot kind of stuff that we humans are 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=221)   subject to. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=222)   You may have noticed things like this happening sometimes. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=226)   Little things become big things. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=233)   You may have noticed it during this retreat. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=237)   We call it yogi mind, right? 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=239)   We're all yogis in the Buddhist sense of the word yogi. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=243)   It doesn't mean someone that can bend into a pretzel. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=246)   It means meditators are called yogis, we're yogis. 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=251)   So the sort of weird things that start to happen where you get little idiosyncrasies 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=259)   of your fellow meditators become sins crying out to heaven for vengeance. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=267)   You notice someone and you haven't talked to them or anything, but you have this entire 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=276)   scenario of how you found your spiritual soulmate. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=282)   This whole thing unfolds and then when you finally break silence and talk to them for 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=293)   about three minutes it's like, what was I thinking? 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=297)   I don't even want to talk to this person anymore. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=301)   So these kinds of sort of inflations of little things, we learn to work with them. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=311)   I highly recommend the poem by Robert Browning called Soliloquy of a Spanish Cloister. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=320)   If you want to see yogi mind to its max, it's just a brilliant piece of work. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=326)   How these monks, this one monk in specific, is just lost in these petty rages. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=338)   So east or west, it's the same. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=342)   This kind of stuff happens. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=345)   So the east and the west monks were having this dispute over who owns the cat. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=359)   So Master Nantran heard the commotion, came out and grabbed the cat, held it up with a 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=373)   knife in another hand. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=376)   Okay now don't get hooked on this. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=379)   See what I mean? 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=382)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=383)   I'll take it too literally. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=386)   There's something being pointed to that's really important. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=392)   And he said, if any of you can say a word, it will save the cat. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=405)   Otherwise I'm going to cut it in two. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=411)   And they were all fixated in confusion and doubt. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=417)   So he cut the cat in two, supposedly. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=426)   Now I'll give you a heads up. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=427)   This is leading to a co-op. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=430)   You're going to be asked a question. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=436)   Shall I give you a hint even before I ask the question? 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=441)   How about that? 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=443)   I will give you a hint. 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=446)   I will tell you, at least in my interpretation, what the answer to the koan is. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=457)   But maybe not as well. 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=459)   Yes. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=460)   The answer to the koan is on my t-shirt. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=467)   So this is like Jeopardy, okay? 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=468)   So what's the question? 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=469)   The answer is on my t-shirt. 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=480)   If you remember what I said about what this means. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=484)   Okay. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=485)   So then what's the question? 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=488)   So when Zhao Zhou returned, Nanquan told him the story of what had happened during the 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=500)   day. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=502)   At which point, Zhao Zhou took off his sandals, put them on top of his head, and walked out. 
<br>[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=521)   To which Nanquan said, Zhao Zhou could have saved the cat. 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=535)   So the koan is, why? 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=542)   Why was Zhao Zhou the person that could have saved the cat? 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=549)   What do you think? 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=551)   Are you fixated in confusion? 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=555)   There's nothing wrong with being confused. 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=556)   In fact, being confused is really good. 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=561)   Being coagulating when you're confused, not good. 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=568)   The goal is not to avoid confusion, doubt, disorientation. 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=575)   The goal is not to avoid don't know. 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=579)   The goal is to avoid the habitual coagulation around don't know. 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=588)   Uncoagulated don't know is called spontaneity when it comes out of your body, and wisdom 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=600)   when it turns in your mind. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=604)   I repeat, uncoagulated don't know is dynamic spontaneity when it comes out of your body, 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=612)   and wisdom when it turns in your mind. 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=617)   So remember the story? 
<br>[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=624)   Nanquan asked the monks to turn a word, to say something, to manifest, and they were 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=632)   coagulated in don't know. 
<br>[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=635)   So they couldn't say anything. 
<br>[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=637)   So they lost the cat. 
<br>[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=646)   Zhao Zhou had an immediate response, no fixation whatsoever. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=653)   But what did it mean? 
<br>[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=656)   It doesn't mean to put your sandals on your head, the part that's underneath is now on 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=670)   top. 
<br>[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=671)   Then where are you? 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=679)   And the person that lives there, there, it would be the kind of person who could save 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=694)   the cat. 
<br>[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=698)   Zen master Wumad, commenting on Zhao Zhou's activity, said something to the effect of 
<br>[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=716)   he grabbed the knife away from Nanquan, and now Nanquan is begging for his life. 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=729)   Praised him that highly. 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=734)   So you don't understand, right? 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=738)   Or maybe some of you do. 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=740)   So not understanding is fine. 
<br>[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=743)   It's good, as long as you're working through the habitual tendencies to coagulate as soon 
<br>[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=754)   as don't know arises. 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=759)   It was a brilliant way to symbolize, without having to use words, what it means to live 
<br>[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=772)   below the arising of the world, to live below what is born, to live in zero. 
<br>[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=789)   The ultimate humility. 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=792)   Such a person could save the cat. 
<br>[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=802)   So Zhao Zhou is famous for his own koan, maybe one of the most famous koans in the whole 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=815)   history of Zen, and one that Sasaki Roshi talks about a lot. 
<br>[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=821)   Thank God, otherwise I wouldn't know how to discuss it for you. 
<br>[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=828)   I've got the cliff notes from an actual master. 
<br>[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=837)   It relates to exactly the same thing. 
<br>[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=842)   It's about exactly the same thing, but from a little different perspective. 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=856)   So Zhao Zhou lived in the Tang Dynasty, and the Tang Dynasty was roughly, very roughly 
<br>[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=869)   600 to 900 AD. 
<br>[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=872)   It's the golden age of Chinese culture. 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=877)   Interesting sort of corresponds to really the darkest period of European history. 
<br>[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=884)   But that was the golden age of Chinese culture. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=888)   Buddhism came into China before that considerably. 
<br>[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=892)   Buddhism came into China in the Han Dynasty. 
<br>[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=896)   Han Dynasty is about 200 BC to 280, so it roughly straddles the beginning of the Christian 
<br>[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=902)   era. 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=903)   Or, you can think of the Han Dynasty as corresponding roughly to the Roman Republic and the Roman 
<br>[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=910)   Empire. 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=911)   So the Roman period, that 400 years, approximately 200 on either side of the time of Jesus. 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=920)   That was Han in China, and Rome was ruling in the Western world. 
<br>[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=926)   It was then that Buddhism came into China as a kooky foreign cult from India. 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=935)   So Tang Dynasty is much later, 600, 700 years later. 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=941)   It took that many centuries for this kooky foreign cult from India to be fully metabolized 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=955)   into a form that was comfortable for the Chinese, meaning an expression of enlightenment that 
<br>[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=964)   fit the Chinese culture. 
<br>[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=970)   And that's Chan, or Zen. 
<br>[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=975)   So these masters from the Tang Dynasty, Ma Zi, Nan Quan, Zhao Zhou, that was from that 
<br>[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=986)   period. 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=990)   It took all those hundreds of years, sort of interesting because I think it's only going 
<br>[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=999)   to take not even 100 years for something similar to happen in the West. 
<br>[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1005)   But then things move much faster now. 
<br>[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1009)   So Northern Chinese to this day call themselves 
<br>[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1021)   Hanran, which you even see it on the internet, Han Chinese. 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1029)   That means as opposed to other ethnic groups that are in China. 
<br>[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1034)   But people from South China, Tongyan, right? 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1041)   Like from Hong Kong, Canton, they call themselves Tang people. 
<br>[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1052)   I guess because why? 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1054)   Maybe it was that, I don't know, but in South China they usually, am I correct, usually 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1061)   use Tang instead of Han? 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1064)   I think it's just a later, right? 
<br>[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1067)   Yeah, it's just a time period. 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1071)   For whatever reason. 
<br>[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1072)   So the way Chinese was pronounced in the Tang Dynasty is preserved in South China. 
<br>[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1085)   Whereas the Mandarin which is spoken in North China has gone through a lot of modifications 
<br>[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1092)   because North China is where all the, well there's just a lot of reasons that the language 
<br>[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1098)   changed up there. 
<br>[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1100)   So this is a famous story. 
<br>[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1102)   I'm going to say it in Mandarin. 
<br>[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1105)   It's a story about Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1108)   But then I asked Philip to say it in Cantonese so you can be able to hear it the way Zhao 
<br>[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1116)   Zhou would have said it and heard it. 
<br>[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1118)   It's a very different feeling tone to the language. 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1122)   So here's the, and then I will translate also into English. 
<br>[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1129)   So Zhao Zhou He Shang Yin Seng Wan Gou Zi Huan You Fo Xin Yan Wu Zhou Yun Wu. 
<br>[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1151)   So that's the story in modern Mandarin pronunciation. 
<br>[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1156)   So Zhao Zhou He Shang, so Master Zhao Zhou Yin Seng Wan happened to be asked by a monk. 
<br>[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1168)   A monk asked Master Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1171)   Gou Zi Huan You Fo Xin Yan Wu. 
<br>[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1179)   Gou Zi means a dog, a puppy. 
<br>[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1183)   Apparently as they were talking this little puppy was walking around or something. 
<br>[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1191)   So the monk pointed to the puppy and said, Gou Zi Huan You Fo Xin Yan Wu. 
<br>[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1199)   Does the dog have Fo Xin, the Buddha nature, Yan Wu or not? 
<br>[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1213)   So You means have, Wu means not have. 
<br>[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1221)   Now Ye makes it an exclusive or. 
<br>[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1227)   Yes or no. 
<br>[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1230)   Does the dog have the Buddha nature? 
<br>[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1234)   So that's the part you have to appreciate about this koan is that the monk is setting 
<br>[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1249)   a track for Master Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1256)   Yes or no, exclusive or. 
<br>[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1262)   So literally in Chinese it's dog, have, Buddha nature or no, not have. 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1277)   But there's a little different language feeling to it if you hear it in the way it probably 
<br>[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1288)   would have sounded to Zhao Zhou. 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1290)   So why don't you manifest that. 
<br>[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1292)   This is the Cantonese pronunciation. 
<br>[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1295)   Zhao Zhou He Shang Yin Zheng Wen Gou Zi Huan You Fo Xin Yan Wu Zhou Yun Mu. 
<br>[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1305)   So You Mu. 
<br>[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1311)   Sounds a little bit more like the English yes, no. 
<br>[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1317)   That's why I like it in the Cantonese pronunciation. 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1323)   Yes or no. 
<br>[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1326)   Does the dog have the Buddha nature? 
<br>[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1331)   Yao, Mu. 
<br>[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1337)   What do you think? 
<br>[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1338)   What's the right answer? 
<br>[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1341)   Shall I give you a hint? 
<br>[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1345)   The right answer depends. 
<br>[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1350)   Depends on the context. 
<br>[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1353)   There's several right answers, but those right answers are also wrong answers in a different 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1360)   context. 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1363)   So let's start with the context of traditional Buddhism. 
<br>[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1371)   From the viewpoint of early Theravada Buddhism, does the dog have a Buddha nature? 
<br>[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1381)   No. 
<br>[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1382)   Only a human being can become a Buddha. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1391)   Animals are too stupid and gods are too blissed out. 
<br>[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1397)   The condition that's in between animals and gods is the human condition. 
<br>[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1403)   Smart enough to figure things out, but uncomfortable enough to be motivated to do something about 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1411)   it. 
<br>[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1413)   So early Buddhist idea is human life is very special because only the human life has the 
<br>[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1420)   right mixture of intelligence, pleasure, and pain to clue a person in to the need for enlightenment. 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1435)   So from that point of view, scholastically, the answer is no. 
<br>[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1439)   Dog doesn't have a Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1445)   So that's Hinayana, that small vehicle point of view. 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1450)   However from the Mahayana point of view, it is a philosophical item of belief that everything 
<br>[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1464)   has the Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1470)   So the Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1483)   The actual characters in Chinese would be written this way. 
<br>[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1494)   I don't know how much you can see it. 
<br>[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1495)   This is Fo, it's pronounced Fo in Mandarin, but it would have been pronounced something 
<br>[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1503)   like Boot a long time ago. 
<br>[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1506)   So that's from Buddha. 
<br>[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1509)   So this means Buddha. 
<br>[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1512)   But the interesting character is this one. 
<br>[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1514)   This means, this side of the character means to be born and this is heart or mind. 
<br>[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1522)   So your nature is the consciousness or mind or heart that you're originally born with. 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1539)   So this word, it's pronounced Sho in Japanese, Shi in Mandarin Chinese. 
<br>[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1550)   This is a very important word in East Asian Buddhism. 
<br>[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1555)   Enlightenment, initial enlightenment, what roughly corresponds to stream entry in Southeast 
<br>[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1564)   Asian Buddhism, is often referred to in Japanese as Kensho. 
<br>[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1570)   Ken means to see and sho means nature. 
<br>[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1574)   When you see your nature. 
<br>[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1577)   But what's interesting is that there's another character, Gen, which is very related to Ken. 
<br>[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1587)   They're actually the same word in archaic Chinese. 
<br>[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1591)   And Gen means to manifest. 
<br>[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1596)   So Ken is the I see it. 
<br>[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1602)   Gen is the it manifests, but they're actually the same word. 
<br>[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1611)   So the Zen teacher that I studied with, several of them actually, said that Kensho, or to 
<br>[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1623)   see your nature, is really Gensho. 
<br>[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1626)   It's to manifest your nature. 
<br>[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1629)   So what is your nature? 
<br>[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1631)   Well, your nature is the, there's only one nature. 
<br>[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1635)   It's the Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1637)   So how would a teacher interpret the Buddha nature? 
<br>[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1642)   Well, you know how one teacher interprets it, the activity of expansion, contraction. 
<br>[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1650)   And that's the interpretation we're going to use here. 
<br>[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1654)   That's the one I'm familiar with. 
<br>[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1656)   So from the viewpoint of Mahayana, does the dog have the Buddha nature? 
<br>[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1665)   The answer is yes. 
<br>[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1668)   Scholastically speaking, the answer is yes. 
<br>[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1674)   So these are the answers that are correct from an intellectual point of view. 
<br>[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1689)   But you can be sure that the monk who was trying to set a trap for Zhaozhou was not 
<br>[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1701)   asking what's the Theravada party line on dog and Buddha nature, or what's the Mahayana 
<br>[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1710)   party line on dog or Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1715)   The monk was no doubt testing the master's ability not to explain, as I just did, the 
<br>[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1733)   answer, but to manifest the answer. 
<br>[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1740)   So if you were master Zhaozhou and someone set a trap for you that you recognized by 
<br>[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1753)   asking you an exclusive or question, okay? 
<br>[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1760)   Yao, mo, yes or no? 
<br>[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1769)   Dog have Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1773)   What are you going to say? 
<br>[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1778)   Good. 
<br>[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1783)   That would definitely be an acceptable answer. 
<br>[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1793)   But maybe a little bit more? 
<br>[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1797)   Go ahead. 
<br>[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1798)   Manifest. 
<br>[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1799)   That would be an acceptable answer. 
<br>[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1814)   Now let's go back to intellectual. 
<br>[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1819)   The problem with the question was the exclusive or. 
<br>[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1826)   So the answer would be to not get caught in the dichotomy of the exclusive or. 
<br>[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1843)   So the answer that we just gave, going back now to intellectual for a minute, was that 
<br>[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1855)   what was that answer in terms of yes and yes, no? 
<br>[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1862)   It's not yes. 
<br>[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1864)   It's not no. 
<br>[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1866)   Is it both or is it neither? 
<br>[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1875)   Can that happen with just yes or just no? 
<br>[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1880)   It takes yes and no, right, to mold anything, to manifest any appearance. 
<br>[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1888)   Takes an interplay of yes and no. 
<br>[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1892)   So that was the answer both, okay? 
<br>[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1899)   You're expanding and contracting, doing the doing called dog. 
<br>[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1906)   Yes, mixing yes and no to manifest the activity called dog. 
<br>[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1914)   So that's a good answer. 
<br>[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1920)   But that's not the one that Joshu gave. 
<br>[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1926)   Yau? 
<br>[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1927)   Mo. 
<br>[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1928)   Okay. 
<br>[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1929)   Joshu said mo, no, no. 
<br>[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1947)   So Joshu's no. 
<br>[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1959)   Is it really no? 
<br>[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1964)   Or is it the closest... 
<br>[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1968)   If you live in a culture that does not have zero as a number, then the closest thing that 
<br>[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1979)   you can have to that which is neither positive nor negative, the only thing that you can 
<br>[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1986)   do that's beyond yes and no, if you have to choose either yes or no to express that which 
<br>[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=1995)   is neither yes nor no, neither movement from nor towards, neither plus nor minus, neither 
<br>[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2003)   expansion nor contraction. 
<br>[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2006)   Well if you had to do one or the other, zero is more like no than it is like yes. 
<br>[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2017)   Especially if you say it in a certain way, okay? 
<br>[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2026)   So the answer to this koan is in how you say the word no. 
<br>[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2036)   If you say the word no in a way that cancels yes and no, which you can actually hear in 
<br>[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2047)   the archaic Chinese. 
<br>[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2049)   In Japanese it's mu. 
<br>[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2053)   Okay. 
<br>[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2055)   And in Cantonese, mo. 
<br>[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2061)   So then it's zero. 
<br>[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2065)   The answer is zero. 
<br>[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2071)   The answer is that which precedes the manifestation of the dog and that which follows the manifestation 
<br>[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2084)   of the dog. 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2087)   Except for the point, the still point, there would be no dance and there is only the dance. 
<br>[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2098)   T.S. 
<br>[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2099)   Eliot. 
<br>[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2100)   So the both, the polarization of yes and no to make a dog or a flower or a life or a planet, 
<br>[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2119)   that is preceded by and followed by what is beyond yes and no. 
<br>[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2131)   So they're inseparable. 
<br>[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2137)   You could, it would have been a correct answer to separate yes and no and manifest dog in 
<br>[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2146)   between. 
<br>[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2148)   But it's equally a correct answer to bring yes and no together because that's what's 
<br>[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2156)   before the both and that's what's after the both. 
<br>[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2165)   So it's a cycle. 
<br>[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2168)   Either the big no, the zero, the aji hongpushode, the alpha privative of the unborn, the place 
<br>[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2184)   where Zhao Zhou acted from, symbolized by having, being below his sandals, below the 
<br>[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2199)   earth, below what is born. 
<br>[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2204)   That place is half of what you need to know to be enlightened and the other half is when 
<br>[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2216)   it's yes and no, dancing together. 
<br>[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2220)   No yes, no no, which is sort of the no with the big capital no. 
<br>[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2232)   The way I personally like to point people to this, just my own style, because I like 
<br>[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2252)   a system, is well the place where things come from, the zero, the source, is the place that 
<br>[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2263)   they go to. 
<br>[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2266)   So you can train yourself gradually, systematically to start to notice when things disappear. 
<br>[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2275)   And the sensitivity develops over time until you finally see what happens, why things disappear. 
<br>[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2284)   The reason things disappear is that the forces, the polar forces that mold them cancel and 
<br>[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2294)   then they repolarize and then they cancel. 
<br>[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2298)   It's a cycle. 
<br>[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2302)   There's another way, well there's many other ways to come to this same knowledge. 
<br>[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2312)   One of the most powerful ways is called self-inquiry. 
<br>[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2317)   It's the flip side of just not God, just the reversal. 
<br>[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2324)   In that practice you're constantly trying to look over your shoulder and see where the 
<br>[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2330)   moment arose from, the unborn whence things are born. 
<br>[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2336)   So you're turning 180 degrees, turning consciousness back on itself, asking who am I, what is this? 
<br>[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2344)   Not as an intellectual question, but as an observing. 
<br>[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2352)   So in that case A has arisen and you ask where did A come from? 
<br>[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2363)   In this other practice, which I like because I can make it systematic and I can gradually 
<br>[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2369)   train people to do it, there's no gradual training for self-inquiry, you just do it. 
<br>[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2376)   There's no algorithm, you just do it. 
<br>[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2381)   The instruction is always the same. 
<br>[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2382)   You go to the teacher and it's just like, well where did that come from? 
<br>[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2388)   So that can be very powerful, but since I like algorithms and systems and let's see 
<br>[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2394)   what's coming up with people and whatever, I like something that I can teach step by 
<br>[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2399)   step. 
<br>[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2401)   So I sort of approach it from the other side, let's see where things go to. 
<br>[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2406)   But it's the same process, the same process. 
<br>[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2419)   So in the just not gone approach, A has arisen and now let's stay with A until we notice 
<br>[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2427)   the instant that A vanishes. 
<br>[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2433)   The instant that A vanishes is also the instant that B arises, the very instant. 
<br>[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2443)   What is B? 
<br>[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2444)   B is whatever came after A. So if you want to be truly at the absolute now whence something 
<br>[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2456)   arises, just watch something pass and then you'll be, either nothing will happen, which 
<br>[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2467)   case you're in chow-chow, or something will happen and you'll notice it coming from nothing. 
<br>[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2484)   Yes and no, my two favorite words. 
<br>[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2490)   Really? 
<br>[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2491)   When I ask someone a question, if they just say yes or just say no, without any modifications, 
<br>[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2504)   that's nice. 
<br>[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2505)   But usually there's modifications. 
<br>[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2514)   So as a parting gift, I'm going to slip you the secret. 
<br>[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2526)   How's that sound? 
<br>[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2529)   I'm going to slip you the secret with regards to yes and no. 
<br>[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soxDmDgdcPg&t=2538)   The goal is to have a clear and deep experience of no. 
<br>
