<br>[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2)   allocked 장난 gibbons at Tribal A.L. 
<br>[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=4)   Ethan Rock and Mizzيhabox at Save L.A.

<br>[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=8)   You 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=38)   can take a moment to let the body settle. Take a nice deep breath in and on the breath 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=52)   out just let the body relax, release any tension, let the jaw drop. You could let the weight 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=59)   of the arms just allow the shoulders to drop back and down. Let the front part of the torso 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=72)   be soft, the belly be soft, allowing the breath to move easily in and out of the soft belly. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=79)   And on the breath in you can allow the spine to lengthen easily, naturally, so that the 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=86)   head is balanced easily on top. The spine is balanced, the head is balanced. There's 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=93)   no muscular effort or energy for the most part involved in sitting. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=100)   There's no muscular effort or energy for the most part involved in sitting. 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=110)   See how you can allow the spine to lengthen and everything else just hang down from it. 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=120)   So there's alert, alertness and repose. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=127)   The lengthening of the spine allows the mind to stay alert and the breath out allows relaxation, 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=145)   letting go, release in the body. Let the face be soft. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=152)   And tune into the body, what it feels like to sit here right now. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=165)   Feeling your arms, your legs, your torso, your head, whole body. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=172)   And there'll be tangible touch sensations of how the world touches your body, clothes 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=184)   on the skin, air, temperature, humidity, pressure of the body on the chair or cushion. These 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=191)   are all just sensations, sensations of breathing, the movement of the breath in and out. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=198)   Tongue in the mouth, eyes in the socket. Just take a moment to allow your awareness to feel 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=225)   the body, letting the awareness circulate and soak into sensations. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=232)   Hands, feet, face. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=293)   And if you find your mind wandering, since we're allowing our awareness to move from 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=303)   location to location, you could always label the name of the location where your attention 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=312)   moves, elbow, knee. With each label, allowing your awareness to move to that location and 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=319)   soak into whatever sensation you feel there, noticing the quality, the texture, the boundaries, 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=328)   is there movement? 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=333)   And then allowing your awareness to stay there or move on to another location, becoming intimate 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=340)   with body sensation, what you're aware of at this moment. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=370)   Okay. 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=400)   Okay. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=431)   And while you're investigating body sensation, you may or may not be aware of a different 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=443)   category of body sensation, subjective, the sensations associated with mood or emotion, 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=450)   different flavors of feeling may arise. There's different qualities of sensation maybe in 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=460)   different locations in the body. For most people, the front part of the torso up into 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=467)   the throat and face are prime central locations for emotional feel in the body. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=474)   So unless you're absolutely emotionally neutral at this time, you may or may not have the 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=481)   slightest tug, pull, spread, cringe, tightness, warmth of pleasant or unpleasant. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=488)   The pleasant or unpleasant would be what we call feel, feeling in, feeling emotion in 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=495)   the body. And it might be quite subtle. Since we're sitting in a relatively quiet room, 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=504)   we may or may not be aware of the subtle, but we're aware of the subtle. 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=511)   And you don't have to know what the feeling is, but if you're aware of any such sensation, 
<br>[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=533)   we'll explore it in a little more detail as we move on. But if you're aware of anything 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=537)   like that now, just allow that to be part of your investigation of body sensation in 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=546)   addition to the tangible face, shoulder, knee, elbow. There may be something in the center 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=553)   of the chest or in the belly. It's related to emotion or mood. Subtle is significant. 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=583)   Good. Now I want you to keep your awareness in the body, and I'm going to clap my hands. 
<br>[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=614)   And I want you to notice you will have a response to the sound of my hands clapping, but there 
<br>[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=622)   may also be a literal vibrational response from sound coming into the body. So just notice 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=629)   what you notice from the sound of my hand clapping, keeping your awareness on the body. 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=641)   Feel that. External sounds play upon our body all day and night. 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=672)   So I'd like you now to practice allowing sounds to move through your body like the body is porous, 
<br>[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=684)   and open your awareness out to the sounds around us. And when we open out to sound, 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=690)   image may get strongly stimulated. You may have images of the environment or pictures 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=701)   you make that you associate with sounds. If that happens, and it probably will, just let 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=707)   that be in the background. That'll be there. But really hear sound and feel the body's 
<br>[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=717)   response to sound, just like the clap, but maybe less dramatic. And my voice, of course, 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=728)   will be a sound, too. 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=759)   Now I'm going to play some sounds for you. All sorts of associative thoughts will come 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=774)   in response to the sound. I want you to notice body sensation of a feeling nature or even 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=786)   just a tangible physical nature in the body to these sounds. 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=817)   Now I'm going to play some sounds for you. All sorts of associative thoughts will come 
<br>[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=823)   in response to the sound. I want you to notice body sensation of a feeling nature or even 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=832)   just a tangible physical nature in the body to these sounds. Now I'm going to play some 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=839)   sounds for you. All sorts of associative thoughts will come in response to the sound. I want 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=846)   you to notice body sensation of a feeling nature or even just a tangible physical nature in 
<br>[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=855)   the body to these sounds. Now I'm going to play some sounds for you. All sorts of associative 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=864)   thoughts will come in response to the sound. 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=894)   Now I'm going to play some sounds for you. All sorts of associative thoughts will come 
<br>[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=923)   in response to the sound. 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=948)   Turn into your body. Part of this is learning where your feeling centers are. Different 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=955)   sounds are going to evoke different kinds of emotional feel. There may be chatter, commentary 
<br>[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=969)   in the head or visual impression, but try to keep your awareness in the body. 
<br>[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=999)   Now I'm going to play some sounds for you. All sorts of associative thoughts will come 
<br>[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1028)   in response to the sound. 
<br>[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1058)   Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. Rock-a-bye baby 
<br>[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1087)   on the treetop. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop. 
<br>[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1107)   Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop. 
<br>[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1138)   Notice what you're feeling in your body now that you weren't when we started the meditation. 
<br>[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1154)   You don't have to be able to identify what the feeling is, what the emotion is, but notice 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1161)   any part of your body that feels pressure moving, different qualities of sensation. 
<br>[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1177)   Notice if there's a tightening around it. See if you could relax the body and allow it to 
<br>[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1185)   flow through like weather. Emotions are like weather, just allowing it to flow through 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1195)   like the sound from the outside. 
<br>[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1213)   Mmm. 
<br>[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1273)   What do you feel where in the body? 
<br>[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1303)   What do you feel where in the body? 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1333)   What do you feel where in the body? 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1363)   What do you feel where in the body? 
<br>[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1384)   Allow image and chatter in the head to be in the background. 
<br>[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1388)   Keep the awareness on body sensation. 
<br>[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1392)   Noticing what you feel where. 
<br>[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1401)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1415)   Extending our awareness to that sensorial experience. 
<br>[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1434)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1450)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1477)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1497)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1517)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1537)   Allowing sounds from the outside to come in and stimulate experience in the body. 
<br>[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1557)   Do you feel something different in the body now? 
<br>[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1586)   Where do you feel it? 
<br>[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1676)   Now you just had a little exercise. 
<br>[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1704)   In that you probably had at least a few different emotional responses to certain sounds that 
<br>[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1713)   were played. 
<br>[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1716)   And the opportunity to notice where and how sensation in the body arose connected to that 
<br>[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1725)   emotional response, whether subtle or quite apparent. 
<br>[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1740)   Now I'd like you to bring your awareness to where you hear the voice in your head, up 
<br>[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1750)   towards the ears or around the head, wherever it is, and I'd like you to find a word, a 
<br>[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1757)   couple words, a phrase, a sound, a syllable, to say to yourself in your head, to help you 
<br>[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1763)   really tune in to where this location is. 
<br>[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1766)   The words can be of a neutral or positive meaning. 
<br>[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1772)   And just say the word or words, elongating the vowel and then taking a little space in 
<br>[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1782)   between. 
<br>[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1785)   Just to tune in to where that location is in your head, to really hear in. 
<br>[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1808)   And now I'd like you to pick a word. 
<br>[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1838)   Pick content of the words. 
<br>[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1840)   Pick something positive. 
<br>[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1844)   Could be an affirmation, could be a prayer, could be a name, could be just two or however 
<br>[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1854)   many words or word or words that seem beautiful or inspiring or loving to you. 
<br>[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1863)   And really listen in to the word in your head, word or words in your head, just like we listened 
<br>[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1869)   out to sound. 
<br>[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1871)   But also noticing any feeling response in the body to that word or words. 
<br>[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1899)   Okay. 
<br>[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1929)   Now let that go and just listen at that location. 
<br>[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1948)   Talk may arise. 
<br>[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1951)   Sometimes just looking at talk makes it disappear unless we're deliberately evoking it. 
<br>[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1955)   For some people, just bringing your awareness to that location will make all talk cease. 
<br>[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1961)   Not for other people. 
<br>[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1963)   But just rest your awareness at that location and you may get clear words. 
<br>[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1969)   You may have a subtle rumbling. 
<br>[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1971)   Maybe you can hear words but it's like behind a door where you can hear the tone but you 
<br>[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1979)   don't know what the words are. 
<br>[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1984)   Or maybe it's quiet and there are no words and then just enjoy the peacefulness of that. 
<br>[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=1990)   But just have some awareness in talk space whether it's clear, subtle or none in terms 
<br>[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2001)   of activity. 
<br>[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2022)   If it's helpful for keeping your awareness there, you could even label clear when you 
<br>[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2026)   hear clear talk, subtle when there's anything that isn't clear and none or quiet when there's 
<br>[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2036)   no talk happening in your head. 
<br>[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2044)   Clear, subtle, none. 
<br>[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2062)   Wow! 
<br>[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2092)   Now, keeping some awareness in the body, what we've been doing for the majority of this 
<br>[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2112)   meditation, noticing sensations of emotional response. 
<br>[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2118)   It may be neutral, there may be subtle things happening, you may be activated from any of 
<br>[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2124)   the sounds that we heard. 
<br>[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2127)   But keep some awareness there and some awareness in talk space, wherever that is for you. 
<br>[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2141)   Just for a few moments, we're going to hold the two in awareness at the same time. 
<br>[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2145)   You may feel a subtle little bubbling, percling in one and maybe a little rise in something 
<br>[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2152)   in the other. 
<br>[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2153)   It may be nothing you could describe or even understand what it is, that's fine. 
<br>[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2159)   This is the first time checking it out. 
<br>[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2162)   It may all be quite murky with some groping. 
<br>[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2168)   Just paying attention at all gives you gold stars on your chart. 
<br>[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2175)   Notice that process of sensory clarity, of tuning in to what's really going on behind 
<br>[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2185)   the curtain. 
<br>[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2186)   If I can, attention. 
<br>[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2206)   Now, for the last few moments, we're going to play with deliberately evoking certain 
<br>[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2234)   kinds of talk in the head, just for you to tune in to the response to the sound on the 
<br>[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2241)   inside, just like we tuned in to the response to the sound on the outside. 
<br>[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2250)   I'd like you to think of a word or words or phrase, of something that's a bit of a challenge 
<br>[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2255)   for you. 
<br>[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2257)   You pick something that you would like to work with at this time. 
<br>[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2267)   So it doesn't have to be the most difficult thing that you could possibly think of in 
<br>[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2272)   your life. 
<br>[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2274)   Just anything that might be a bit of a challenge to work with. 
<br>[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2284)   Interactive talk of whatever kind. 
<br>[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2289)   Hear it. 
<br>[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2291)   Feel the body's response to it. 
<br>[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2293)   It will probably be a very familiar sensation. 
<br>[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2307)   And while you're doing this, see if you can relax the body with every breath out, letting 
<br>[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2325)   go of tension so that whatever arises doesn't get stuck, can just flow through. 
<br>[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2332)   It's like ringing a bell. 
<br>[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2334)   It will ring and then it stops. 
<br>[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2356)   Now, let go of that talk. 
<br>[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2369)   The feeling may go when you let go of the talk. 
<br>[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2372)   The feeling may linger. 
<br>[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2375)   Just hear the sounds present right now. 
<br>[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2380)   Allow them to flow through your body. 
<br>[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2407)   Now I'd like you to think of a tune, a song, any bit of music with accompaniment from the 
<br>[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2417)   outside. 
<br>[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2422)   Any bit of music you find pleasant, that you like listening to, that you listen to a lot, 
<br>[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2427)   that you haven't listened to in a long time. 
<br>[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2429)   Even if it's just a couple measures of it, and sing it to yourself in your head, the 
<br>[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2438)   part you like. 
<br>[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2439)   Notice the 
<br>[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2466)   body's response to the tune. 
<br>[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2481)   And let the tune go, keeping some awareness in talk space, some awareness in the feel 
<br>[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2506)   centers of your body. 
<br>[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2515)   And the last thing we will evoke is something positive, something that feels good to you. 
<br>[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2522)   Word, words, phrase, name, prayer, mantra. 
<br>[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2530)   Something that makes you feel good, whether it's love-based, humor-based, inspiring, comforting. 
<br>[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2548)   And hear those words, and feel what happens in your body. 
<br>[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2565)   Right. 
<br>[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2625)   Okay, good work. 
<br>[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2655)   Take a nice deep breath in and on the breath out, let it all go. 
<br>[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2660)   Just feel what it feels like to sit here right now and you don't have to do anything. 
<br>[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2666)   You don't have to focus in any way. 
<br>[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2671)   Just sitting. 
<br>[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2674)   Letting nature do the work. 
<br>[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2677)   Let yourself be meditated. 
<br>[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2694)   Be ready. 
<br>[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwuo_LbTT3U&t=2771)   you 
<br>
