title: "Upgrade to an Awake Operating System ~ Loch Kelly with Stephanie Nash"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=0)   So I'm Stephanie Nash and I am here talking with Locke Kelly. 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=13)   Hi Locke. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=14)   Hey, how are you doing Stephanie? 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=15)   Good to see you. 
<br>[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=17)   We met at the International Dharma Teacher Gathering. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=20)   That's right. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=21)   I remember you swimming in the pond in the lake in the morning. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=26)   And he did a wonderful workshop there that gave a couple of exercises I really liked 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=30)   and I used for the next year. 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=33)   I come from Shenzhen and I kind of used some of his things but in another neat, simple, 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=38)   direct way I liked a lot. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=41)   And we're in LA now. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=44)   And Locke just did a workshop that I attended yesterday and we thought we would talk about 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=51)   that and stuff. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=52)   I do want to say the workshop was offered by Compassion LA and it's a group here that 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=59)   offers workshops that work with compassion and awakening wisdom workshops. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=65)   And their website is CompassionLA.org. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=68)   So there's my plug for the people who brought him here and thank you to them for that work. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=75)   And so I just wanted to talk to you about what it is we were doing yesterday with these 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=83)   exercises. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=84)   I'm intrigued by your style of directing. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=86)   You're not telling people to go off and meditate for 10 hours and maybe at some point you can 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=92)   reach nirvana or samadhi or oneness with the universe. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=98)   You have some really interesting exercises and that work with open-hearted. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=104)   Open-hearted, what is open-hearted? 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=106)   So open-hearted awareness, so the non-profit institute that I'm part of is Open-Hearted 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=112)   Awareness Institute. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=113)   And do they have a dot-com or dot-org? 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=116)   We have a website that's under EffortlessMindfulness.org or LockeKelley.org. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=125)   I like effortless mindfulness. 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=128)   I like anything effortless. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=132)   So the effortless is not that you make no effort, but that you discover that there's 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=139)   an awareness that's already effortlessly aware. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=142)   And that I think is kind of the missing piece in the map in Western culture and is often 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=149)   in even Buddhism and other meditation systems. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=153)   It's put off into kind of an esoteric or, well, you really can't access that immediately. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=160)   You've got to wait three years, 30 years, three lifetimes. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=164)   Yes, you say a few lifetimes later. 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=167)   Meanwhile, those who do have an awakening, whether it's intentional or unintentional, 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=174)   report back to us that it's already here and it's already available within us. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=179)   So that's the premise that I was told. 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=183)   And then as a curious American New Yorker, I said, well, wait a minute then. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=190)   If it's already here and it's accessible, let's check it out. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=195)   Let's see if we can, are there groups and approaches and people and teachings that start 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=204)   or do a little more of accessing this, recognizing and realizing this in the midst of daily life 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=213)   rather than going off to a monastery. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=216)   So that's the premise. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=217)   Which is key. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=218)   Because have you been to a monastery lately? 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=221)   Well, I mean, it's great, but we can't all do that. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=226)   Yes. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=227)   And for those who do that, that's another approach. 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=229)   But is there another approach? 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=231)   And what I discovered in kind of traveling around and being interested in this world 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=235)   of meditation, psychology, and eventually the talk I gave at Dharma Teachers was on 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=242)   neuroscience and meditation and awakening. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=247)   So really bringing kind of contemporary approach of scientific inquiry, which means what's 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=256)   true, what works, what's actually happening. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=259)   Are people really getting this? 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=261)   Is this an imagination or is this really changing people's lives in a way that they're not 
<br>[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=266)   only waking up, but they're growing up. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=268)   That's a kind of maturity, integrity, compassion. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=273)   Is this possible? 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=275)   And I think where I am now is that it really is possible in the midst of daily life. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=281)   It's almost like the next natural stage of human development. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=285)   Evolution. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=286)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=287)   So it's evolution and potential. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=291)   It's esoteric only in that means that it's paradoxical, meaning it's not the normal way 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=304)   we learn something by using our minds or informational is not the way you learn this. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=312)   It's more like feeling how you ride a bicycle. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=316)   Did you come up with this way of presenting things or did you study with somebody who 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=321)   did it? 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=322)   Because you have some simple exercises that like I don't think I've ever been to a workshop 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=328)   or a presentation where someone just said, okay, we talked for a moment about stuff, 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=333)   but then it's like, okay, let's try this. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=335)   Okay, feel that? 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=336)   Feel that? 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=337)   And everyone's like, and literally three minutes later, everyone's reporting the adjectives. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=343)   I said as a teacher, it's like a high five. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=346)   It's like everyone's reporting all these adjectives of openness, freedom, peace, various things 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=350)   they got just from trying something right there in that moment. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=354)   Now, did you develop these techniques? 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=359)   In looking from the beginning for what is the goal? 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=365)   What is the result? 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=367)   What is this thing that people call awakening or what is that about? 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=372)   What does that give you? 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=373)   What does that mean? 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=374)   What changes? 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=375)   What's absent? 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=376)   What's present? 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=378)   I started following that interesting premise to see who it is that was talking about this. 
<br>[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=389)   And so then I kind of went around from Zen to Vipassana to Tibetan Buddhism, both the 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=396)   Dzogchen and the Maha Mudra, which is really where I ended up. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=401)   Many of the practices are based on Maha Mudra, but some are Advaita, some are from Taoism. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=409)   But there's a... 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=410)   And you can see that thread through them all. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=412)   And some are just... and then once you start to have a shift into this, what's called recognition 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=420)   or realization, then it's kind of like awareness shows itself to itself. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=425)   So there starts to be this curious, almost like a way that, oh, well, wait a minute. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=432)   First I'm here and I'm contracted and identified, and then I'm open, and then the openness is 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=438)   denied, and then the openness is open-hearted, and then it's related. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=442)   But now I'm stuck in here, but now I'm stuck, I'm blissed in, I'm spaced out. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=447)   So how do I get from here to here? 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=450)   And is there an intentional way, or is that efforting kind of a doing that keeps you from 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=458)   letting go? 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=459)   So those kind of curious questions, but I didn't approach it intellectually. 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=463)   I approached it like a palpable, experiential experiment. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=471)   Like let's find out, let's do it, let's find the way to shift into it and find a way to 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=480)   live from it in the middle of, for me, New York City. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=484)   So I'm like, might as well go. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=485)   That's where I started. 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=486)   You can do it there. 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=487)   That's what I said. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=488)   If you can walk down the street there, you've got it. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=491)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=492)   You can do it in the subway, and it works just as well. 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=495)   That was the beginning of my practices in New York, yeah. 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=498)   It's a great opportunity. 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=503)   So you did put this together yourself. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=506)   One thing that I'm especially intrigued by, because physicality is something that I'm 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=513)   very active with, the kind of embodied person, and I do a lot of movement, and I work with 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=518)   a lot of physical modalities and posture for meditation, and how we communicate with our 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=523)   body and how we can allow our body to move in certain ways that affects how we think 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=530)   and feel. 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=531)   Right. 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=532)   And you, in this development, as you were pulling from all these ingredients and cooking 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=538)   your own stuff, you actually came up with kind of movements. 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=542)   It's a physical way. 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=544)   You have a journey from being in here to the heart, and you just talked about that progression. 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=550)   Yes, that's right. 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=551)   And then it's really, you ended up having us do an exercise, actually, literally moving 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=555)   from here to here, to the heart, to out. 
<br>[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=558)   And you had physical movements we did, which I thought, for me personally, I thought there 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=566)   were two levels this learning goes in. 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=568)   In addition, someone can say something, you can hear it, you can conceptualize it, you 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=574)   can even try moving your focus around. 
<br>[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=577)   But when you add this physicality, for me, once I'm physically moving, it's like a mudra 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=581)   or something, it goes in my body in a different way with just a physical, you're just using 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=588)   hands and arms to kind of help us bring us into it. 
<br>[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=592)   But I liked that physical commitment to it. 
<br>[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=595)   And the second was watching it. 
<br>[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=597)   You'll be up there and I was saying, it's like he's conducting with his body, fluid, 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=601)   very fluid movement. 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=602)   And now you're doing it. 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=603)   I know, I feel like, I talk a lot with my hands anyway. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=609)   But, you know, because we hear things and that's one, I was mentioning this, that's 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=613)   one part of the brain, but then we see you do it and visually we get an impression. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=618)   So there's the physical, the feeling, we hear the words and then we see it. 
<br>[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=622)   And so I thought it is a way of, your whole approach is about, let's just do this right 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=629)   now there, feel it. 
<br>[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=631)   And so, and it goes in, in those three different modalities, you see here, feel is something 
<br>[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=636)   that, you know, I'm trained in those being our three primary sanskrit. 
<br>[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=643)   So I was very, I was impressed, but I liked, it was fun. 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=649)   It makes it as opposed to, I am going now, I'm going to, I got to get enlightened by 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=654)   two o'clock. 
<br>[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=656)   It was really fun. 
<br>[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=657)   I enjoyed this very much. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=659)   So, and your personality is also, you can get Woody Allen-y sometimes. 
<br>[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=667)   Or other, you had other comedy people you were doing in there. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=670)   But so you want to talk about this physicality of it a little bit? 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=673)   Yeah, I mean, one, you know, like you, I've also been, you know, always been kind of physical 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=679)   and played a lot of sports. 
<br>[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=681)   So I would say, you know, one little story would be, one way that I discovered this was 
<br>[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=687)   that I was an ice hockey goalie. 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=688)   Oh, were you? 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=689)   How are your knees? 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=691)   Yeah, they're okay. 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=692)   Okay. 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=693)   I think the sitting on the cushion was worse for me. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=694)   My nephew was an ice hockey goalie. 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=697)   So I had discovered the way that I played best was I would shift into another mode of 
<br>[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=706)   perception. 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=707)   And then I heard on TV, somebody talking, a commentator talking about a quarterback, 
<br>[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=713)   and they said, he's got eyes in the back of his head. 
<br>[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=717)   And I was like, you know, 14. 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=718)   So I was like, he's got eyes in the back of the head. 
<br>[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=720)   How do you do that? 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=721)   How do you get that? 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=722)   So I literally started developing this way. 
<br>[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=726)   I thought, okay, well, I can go this far. 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=729)   Let me continue bringing my awareness around this way. 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=734)   And as soon as I brought my awareness around to this 360 degree panoramic awareness, I 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=740)   opened up my panoramic and peripheral vision, and then I dropped down into my body and there 
<br>[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=748)   became this natural, almost field of awareness where I felt like a cat. 
<br>[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=754)   And then I would just trust from there that, you know, I'd see somebody take a slap shot, 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=760)   but there'd be all these legs. 
<br>[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=761)   And all of a sudden, I just trust in my hand would shoot out, and the puck would be in 
<br>[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=765)   there. 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=766)   And I figured, okay, so rather than being hyper vigilant and one pointed in this effort, 
<br>[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=773)   the efforting mind, learn how to relax, but not relax, like go to sleep. 
<br>[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=778)   But there's another mode of perceiving that's called, you know, that people know, called 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=783)   the zone or being in the flow. 
<br>[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=787)   So the flow state, this was 14. 
<br>[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=789)   This was a 14. 
<br>[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=790)   14. 
<br>[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=791)   You did this? 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=792)   Oh, well, see, he took it a long time. 
<br>[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=793)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=794)   And, you know, so I felt this and then I was explaining it to a friend who actually lives 
<br>[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=800)   in LA and is going to come over. 
<br>[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=802)   Oh, the web? 
<br>[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=803)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=804)   And I was saying like, you know, well, you know, I said, how'd you do that, man? 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=811)   You know, and I started to put it into words. 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=814)   And he was like, Oh, cool. 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=815)   Great. 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=816)   Happy for you. 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=817)   This is one of your. 
<br>[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=818)   Okay. 
<br>[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=819)   Didn't really want to. 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=820)   I really want that information. 
<br>[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=824)   I have no idea what you're talking about. 
<br>[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=826)   I was just asking you like, you know, you know, just say something normal, you know, 
<br>[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=831)   but so then but then one of the seniors on the team overheard me and the next week he 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=838)   came in and gave me this book, Zen and the Art of Archery. 
<br>[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=842)   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=844)   He said, here kid, this is what you were talking about. 
<br>[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=847)   Wow. 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=848)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=849)   I mean, at that age, he was new to read that. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=850)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=851)   Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=852)   When I was at Duke in the art class, she never told us how to paint. 
<br>[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=859)   She just sat there reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. 
<br>[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=860)   That's what we were like trying to paint. 
<br>[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=861)   She might come over and go, you know, see that there. 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=862)   And she'd go back and read it. 
<br>[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=863)   But that's and then I did Zen and the Art of Archery. 
<br>[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=871)   Oh, that is so interesting. 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=873)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=874)   Well, what was, you know, this panoramic vision and that is key to what you do. 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=877)   But then the dropping down into the body part. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=880)   Now, what made you at the age of 14 go because you just had to do something. 
<br>[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=887)   That's why you thought to. 
<br>[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=889)   I felt that shift that when you open and then are doing something physical, that all of 
<br>[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=895)   a sudden the feeling is as if you're in every cell of your body. 
<br>[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=899)   And the center is more like your gut, your dantian or your heart. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=904)   And you actually are optimally functioning without thinking about thinking. 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=911)   So all that information is processed in. 
<br>[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=915)   And then I realized, OK, people talk about it in certain activities like sports or art. 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=922)   But can we do this in everyday life, in relating and creating? 
<br>[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=928)   Because often you'll see sports stars who get in the zone when they come out of it. 
<br>[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=933)   They're actually the opposite. 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=934)   Or you'll see artists or writers who can get in the zone and then all of a sudden their 
<br>[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=938)   life is a mess because the rest they don't feel the way they feel. 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=942)   And that's so you almost become compulsively addicted to that, which takes you out of it. 
<br>[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=949)   So I know I there are many actors who when they're acting, they feel so alive. 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=955)   That's right. 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=956)   And they will wait tables and, you know, do things for the rest of life just to get another 
<br>[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=960)   few minutes of that hit of that high. 
<br>[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=963)   And what I try to say is a meditation teacher that's available in each moment. 
<br>[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=967)   But they think, no, I have to be on stage. 
<br>[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=970)   You know, they get that zone experience. 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=974)   Two things come to mind. 
<br>[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=975)   One was the way I understood that samurai were trained was that they're not looking 
<br>[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=981)   at where their opponent is or where the weapon is. 
<br>[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=984)   They actually go into a broad focus where they're not even looking at them. 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=990)   They're literally just kind of in you go into an almost feeling of the environment. 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=994)   And it's this kind of broad focus. 
<br>[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=997)   And I remember playing with that myself and realizing that there were times in which I 
<br>[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1003)   was doing that driving can be one. 
<br>[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1007)   Sometimes in driving, I'm just watching the kind of movement of everything, the flow of 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1011)   the visual field. 
<br>[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1012)   But what naturally happens is this extension out into space in a way where I'm part of 
<br>[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1020)   the space. 
<br>[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1021)   Yes. 
<br>[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1022)   You know, I'm just one of the elements moving in it. 
<br>[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1024)   But this relational experience with everything, it's like we're all one organism and I'm 
<br>[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1030)   one part of this larger organism. 
<br>[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1032)   But this getting back and bringing it into the body part. 
<br>[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1037)   I do find that what's wonderful is that mindfulness is coming into the Western world and it's 
<br>[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1044)   a revolution in a sense is starting there. 
<br>[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1047)   And that's my hope for our planet at this time. 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1051)   But often the way in, it is we are minds, you know, it's how we're thinking. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1057)   And the embodied aspect of it is sometimes just left out. 
<br>[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1062)   That's right. 
<br>[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1063)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1064)   And that's something that's so important to me. 
<br>[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1066)   And one of the reasons, one of the reasons I adore what you do, it's just, you know, 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1071)   what you do is really like my style. 
<br>[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1072)   I love it. 
<br>[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1073)   But that you have said every time, you'll say, you talk about that panoramic awareness 
<br>[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1079)   and then bringing it into the body. 
<br>[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1082)   And you know, I think of it as including like, you know, kind of the way I just described 
<br>[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1086)   it. 
<br>[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1087)   But it's wonderful that you make that in your journey that, no, it's got to happen. 
<br>[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1093)   And so could you just talk about that progression a little more? 
<br>[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1097)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1098)   So, you know, often when people start with mindfulness, you know, which is wonderful 
<br>[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1103)   for stress relief and for kind of traditional preliminary practices. 
<br>[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1108)   And relaxation. 
<br>[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1109)   And relaxation. 
<br>[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1110)   That's the aspect of the body people will like. 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1112)   That's right. 
<br>[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1114)   But that some of the tools of the initial preliminary practices are actually one pointed 
<br>[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1121)   focus using the attention of the moving mind. 
<br>[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1128)   And yet the effortless mindfulness or more advanced practice, you actually have to learn 
<br>[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1132)   the other set of skills. 
<br>[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1134)   You have to learn not only opening your awareness so that you're in the zone and trusting this 
<br>[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1141)   non-conceptual intelligence that is not checking with thought constantly and is not a quick 
<br>[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1149)   mind but actually is a mind that is made of more spacious awareness. 
<br>[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1159)   So the kind of... 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1161)   So the Dzogchen, Mahamudra. 
<br>[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1163)   Mahamudra or even Zen, Big Sky Mind, you know, this kind of thing. 
<br>[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1168)   And that the small sense of self which is made of or the ego center which is made of 
<br>[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1174)   thought referring to thought and creates a little character looking out of your eyes 
<br>[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1179)   that feels like it's looking out of your eyes and feels like it's an entity. 
<br>[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1182)   He does a lot of funny riffs on that. 
<br>[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1186)   That that, you know, that is one way of functioning. 
<br>[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1189)   That's one way of operating. 
<br>[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1192)   But it's the little thought based ego center is just too small to deal with a full emotional 
<br>[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1200)   life, a full life of intimacy and, you know, and joy in the world. 
<br>[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1208)   So we're not just... 
<br>[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1211)   So I realized that often the first step of stepping out of this ego center and into kind 
<br>[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1221)   of either a meditative state or even a bigger pure awareness is only partway there but often 
<br>[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1231)   important. 
<br>[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1232)   And the usual progression is calm, use focus to calm or calm to focus and then that will 
<br>[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1239)   calm the chattering mind and then to open up your meditative awareness or discover that 
<br>[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1250)   there's kind of a bigger, more open mind, open heart which is literally the feeling 
<br>[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1256)   you get, not an intellectual idea. 
<br>[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1259)   And then you're kind of... so the way I have people move is actually to feel like awareness 
<br>[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1266)   can unhook from thought and then open to the space. 
<br>[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1270)   And then unhook from thought. 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1271)   He always puts it that way and I like that very much. 
<br>[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1273)   It's like, it's doing it just on the hook. 
<br>[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1275)   It's very... 
<br>[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1276)   It's just like he just says it and everyone goes, oh, okay. 
<br>[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1279)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1280)   And I thought it was so perfect. 
<br>[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1283)   And I keep going. 
<br>[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1284)   And one of the strange premises that I realized, I didn't even realize I was doing in the beginning. 
<br>[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1291)   I thought in the beginning, well, okay, but yeah, the one who's unhooking is not the doer, 
<br>[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1296)   is not the ego that's unhooking. 
<br>[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1298)   But then I just kind of kept going and then I realized, oh, I see what I'm doing. 
<br>[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1302)   I'm actually asking the awake person the awareness that they already are, that they've already 
<br>[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1308)   been to unhook awareness from thought and that that awareness or that awake, empty, 
<br>[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1316)   lucid clarity has a life already and actually has the ability to move and has a kind of 
<br>[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1325)   intentionality. 
<br>[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1326)   It isn't just passive. 
<br>[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1329)   And that often it's been defined as this passive, you know, recognition of awake awareness that 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1335)   you just sit in a meditative state and it's lovely and it's free of suffering. 
<br>[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1340)   But then one day back to work from a long day retreat and you have the only option you 
<br>[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1345)   have is operating from ego center. 
<br>[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1348)   So this is really about upgrading the operating system. 
<br>[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1352)   Our little tech dropped. 
<br>[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1357)   Got to apply it. 
<br>[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1362)   But literally stepping out of the current little small sense of self, opening to space 
<br>[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1370)   and then discovering that the awareness actually is discovering an aware mind, what's called 
<br>[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1377)   nature of mind, big sky mind, pure awareness that is already aware and has already been 
<br>[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1385)   aware both outside and then. 
<br>[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1390)   And before you go on, and there's someone could never have. 
<br>[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1394)   I just want to say this. 
<br>[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1396)   This isn't just like, hi, I've been on the spiritual path for 12 years now. 
<br>[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1400)   Now I'm trying chapter number 17. 
<br>[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1403)   Someone could walk in and have never done anything and go through this. 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1407)   So it's appealing kind of directly in that way. 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1411)   But one thing I want to say about when you're talking about big sky mind, there's a space. 
<br>[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1415)   I want to just kind of emphasize the spatiality of it that we're here. 
<br>[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1421)   No we're not. 
<br>[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1422)   You really get the sense that no, you are. 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1425)   So that sense of that extended space of self. 
<br>[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1430)   I just wanted to, for someone who could just walk in there and go, oh, my awareness is 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1435)   that big. 
<br>[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1436)   How can that be? 
<br>[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1438)   And again, he takes you right there experientially like into second. 
<br>[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1444)   So but now continue on. 
<br>[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1446)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1447)   And just to say what you're saying, because it's the most important point is that this 
<br>[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1453)   awakeness that's both embodied and open hearted is already here. 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1458)   And it's a consciousness that's already installed in us. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1463)   It doesn't have to be developed or created. 
<br>[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1465)   But we haven't known how to access it. 
<br>[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1468)   So that's been my whole project. 
<br>[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1470)   It's like, wait a minute. 
<br>[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1471)   Why do you have to do this and this and this to get to here? 
<br>[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1475)   Because once I'm here, let me feel what it's like to lose it. 
<br>[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1479)   And then let me go back and shift back into it. 
<br>[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1482)   Oh, well, I didn't have to do those eight things to get back. 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1486)   Let me see what is the map of consciousness experientially? 
<br>[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1492)   And then how do you navigate it? 
<br>[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1493)   And then how do you translate it to somebody and make the language more contemporary and 
<br>[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1500)   more experiential? 
<br>[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1502)   So that's kind of what I've been doing is like translating, translating, translating, 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1505)   not just text. 
<br>[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1506)   But yeah, like what's your New Yorker direct get it is it here? 
<br>[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1510)   Just get to the point, right? 
<br>[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1511)   You know, let's go do what's needed and no more. 
<br>[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1514)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1515)   And do it like you learn, you know, you know, you know, take care of your consciousness the 
<br>[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1520)   way you learn to eat or whether you go to the gym or you do, you know, yoga posture. 
<br>[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1525)   It's like sometimes I call it the yoga of awareness. 
<br>[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1528)   So it's but the interesting thing is, which is what I'm coming back to now is that what 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1534)   it is that's moving and what it is that knows this ground, which is pure awareness, is only 
<br>[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1541)   awareness. 
<br>[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1543)   And that's why most people have missed it is because we're trying to effort it. 
<br>[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1548)   We're using our will. 
<br>[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1550)   We're using our mind. 
<br>[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1551)   And we're even using attention of the mind, which which actually can't see it, nor can 
<br>[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1559)   mindful witnessing see the pure awareness. 
<br>[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1562)   So even that which pulls back and is able to observe thought can't turn around. 
<br>[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1568)   It's actually has to be that which is already made of the non local awareness that's locally 
<br>[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1575)   attached or identified. 
<br>[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1578)   That can drop that can open from thought and then discover itself as kind of non local 
<br>[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1587)   awareness and be aware of itself without thought and without senses just from it just doesn't 
<br>[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1594)   have to do it that long. 
<br>[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1596)   It doesn't have to be a long retreat or half hour meditation. 
<br>[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1600)   It just needs to plug in or surrender or tune in to that which has already been aware. 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1607)   And then as that which is aware, the next important move is the intentionality realizes 
<br>[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1614)   Oh, form is emptiness. 
<br>[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1618)   Now emptiness is form. 
<br>[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1620)   So the awareness realizes it's aliveness and the feeling of the ocean appearing as waves 
<br>[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1627)   of consciousness is where you drop back in and you have a it's like you've shifted figure 
<br>[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1634)   ground of what's awake, what you're aware of, then you can be aware of all your thoughts, 
<br>[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1640)   feelings, sensations, but you're aware from this huge, loving, supportive inside outside 
<br>[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1647)   is the same. 
<br>[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1649)   And you're free of the anxious, perpetually dissatisfied commentator. 
<br>[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1655)   That's it, we can just stop right now. 
<br>[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1664)   That's pretty much it. 
<br>[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1665)   Yeah, yeah, God, so many things I want to say. 
<br>[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1670)   And then one more thing is that so then when there's this embodied kind of continuous field 
<br>[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1676)   of awareness that's primary, you the anxious, the anxiety is gone about anxiousness and 
<br>[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1684)   the judging, but you still have your full range of emotions. 
<br>[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1687)   You're not detached. 
<br>[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1688)   You're going to start walking into walls or anything. 
<br>[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1693)   You're actually in a flow state, which is more optimally functioning. 
<br>[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1696)   And you've dropped not only into your body, but you've dropped from head to heart mind. 
<br>[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1702)   So it's a feeling that people even if I don't describe it, they say, and I love the term 
<br>[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1706)   heart mind. 
<br>[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1707)   Yeah, it's juicy. 
<br>[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1709)   What I was going to just say two things real quick. 
<br>[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1711)   One was when you just described that, and I thought it, but you talked about the kind 
<br>[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1717)   of loving support of it. 
<br>[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1719)   And I remember I came up to him after, oh, in an intermission, or maybe it was after 
<br>[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1723)   the Friday night. 
<br>[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1724)   Okay, and you did? 
<br>[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1725)   Yes. 
<br>[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1726)   And I said when he was describing it, and I thought, you know, I, when I first learned 
<br>[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1730)   Buddhism, and they're talking about refuge, I thought that's what they were talking about. 
<br>[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1734)   Because I thought that is the ultimate refuge. 
<br>[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1737)   Yes, and it is the ultimate refuge that even in Buddhism, you start with Buddha, and then 
<br>[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1744)   you start with or you start with your guru or your teacher, take refuge in the Buddha, 
<br>[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1749)   the Dharma, the Sangha, and then you start, you know, with and then you realize, oh, the 
<br>[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1756)   teachers outside, oh, no, the teachers inside. 
<br>[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1758)   And then some Tibetans do like, oh, there's a deity, but then the deity melts into you. 
<br>[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1762)   And then you arises that. 
<br>[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1764)   So ultimately, it is in the systems, ultimately, the refuge is the Tao or the Buddha nature, 
<br>[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1773)   true nature. 
<br>[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uayVfEDcT4&t=1774)   It's like a direct path to the ultimate refuge.
