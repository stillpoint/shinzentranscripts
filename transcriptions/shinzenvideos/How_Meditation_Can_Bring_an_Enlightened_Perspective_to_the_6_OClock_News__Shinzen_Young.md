<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=0)   How can meditation help you love deeply? 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=10)   Meditation can help you love deeply. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=14)   And in fact, without it, it's probably going to be very difficult to love deeply, 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=21)   in the sense that I'm using the term. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=24)   Meditation can also help you act effectively, 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=27)   and there's a lot more to acting effectively than just what meditation can bring. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=34)   There's many, many, many specifics. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=38)   But the one thing that meditation does help, in terms of acting effectively, 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=43)   is it helps our actions to be motivated and directed by our emotions, 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=55)   as opposed to being driven and distorted. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=61)   When I look out at the world and I see stuff that upsets me, 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=70)   that causes rage, terror, grief, shame, a sense of helplessness, 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=78)   which is pretty much the 6 o'clock news every night, 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=86)   what I try to remember is, in the end, in the deepest analysis, why is this happening? 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=98)   There's surface analysis, and that's important, 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=102)   but for me as an individual, in that moment, 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=108)   the most important thing is to not forget, because it's really easy to forget, 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=114)   not forget deeply why this doo-doo is occurring. 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=120)   And deeply why this doo-doo is occurring, 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=124)   that this doo-doo can be any one of the gazillion things that is the litany of horrors of the 6 o'clock news. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=135)   Deeply, it's not because human beings get together and try to create bad stuff. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=143)   That doesn't happen very often. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=146)   Human beings get together and try to solve stuff, 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=151)   but the solutions are typically driven and distorted by suffering. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=159)   And so, they're suboptimal. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=162)   Now, sometimes that's okay, because one's suboptimal in this way, 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=167)   and the other's suboptimal in this way, and they sort of cancel out, 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=170)   and we sort of muddle through. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=173)   So, sometimes that's okay, but sometimes, 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=177)   a whole bunch of people will be suboptimal in exactly the same way, 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=182)   and then it reinforces and turns into something horrible. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=188)   So, I try to remember, okay, 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=192)   how many millions of people for how many decades or centuries 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=199)   experienced rage, grief, shame, terror, 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=205)   and such, just like I'm experiencing right now, 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=209)   and they did not remember to experience it fully. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=218)   So, it caused a drivenness, a distortedness in their solution-seeking, 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=225)   and the effect of those bad decisions, 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=230)   a lot of times they just cancel out, it's okay, 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=232)   but if they don't cancel out, they all line up, 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=236)   and we get horrible, horrible things. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=241)   So, I try to remember in that moment, okay, 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=246)   it may seem like less than a drop in the bucket, 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=249)   but I want to make sure that I'm doing my part at the deepest level 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=256)   to improve the human condition at the deepest level. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=267)   That doesn't preclude taking action at other levels, 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=271)   but for that moment, when it hits me, 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=275)   I want to be able to have, I want to, 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=281)   metaphor, it's a little maybe humorous or it might sound even cavalier, 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=287)   but I think the secret is the opposite of the James Bond martini. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=295)   You follow? It's the opposite of the James Bond martini. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=299)   You want to be stirred, not shaken. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=305)   So, I try to be stirred and not shaken, 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=309)   and I use the focus in technique, that's in senior field. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=314)   So, that helps with acting effectively, 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=320)   but I'm not for a moment claiming that that's the totality of acting effectively, 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=326)   but if that component isn't there, 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=330)   then in some subtle way, and you might say, 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=333)   well, it's so subtle it doesn't matter, 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=335)   but I think it matters because it's qualitative, 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=338)   it may not be quantitative, but in some subtle way, 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=341)   I'm just part of the problem. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=345)   I'm part of what made this. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=350)   So, the love deeply part of doing something about the world, 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=360)   this practice is very relevant to that. 
<br>[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=363)   And the act effectively part, it's relevant also, 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAoFaH-p0TA&t=368)   but it's not the whole picture by any means.
