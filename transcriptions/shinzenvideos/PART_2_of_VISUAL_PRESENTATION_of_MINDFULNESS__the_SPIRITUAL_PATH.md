---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=0)   Okay, so those are my three udanas, my three utterances. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=19)   Now I'm going to put them all together in one diagram. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=26)   And that diagram furthermore is going to show you how to store and retrieve everything I 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=34)   have ever taught you in essence, to put it on one page. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=41)   So that's a lot of information and a lot of relationships between information. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=47)   So I'm going to give you information, info. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=52)   The info is about mindfulness. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=57)   Info. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=60)   Some of the info is basic. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=70)   The basic info answers five questions. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=76)   What is mindfulness? 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=78)   You already know, right? 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=82)   I practice mindfulness. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=84)   You already know, I showed you. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=86)   At least in one formulation. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=89)   How do you develop mindfulness? 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=91)   We just covered that too, okay? 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=94)   That was the first utterance, now wasn't it? 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=98)   What is mindfulness? 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=99)   I showed you the three sides, etc. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=103)   Then there's the question of where is mindfulness? 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=110)   And there is the question of when is mindfulness. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=112)   When, meaning when did mindfulness develop? 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=115)   Well, the when of mindfulness is still developing and that's the utterance I just made, okay? 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=121)   With the shamanism, the meditation, the prehistory, the history, the present, and possible future. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=130)   So that's the when, you already know that. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=134)   The where you also know, it's the human condition. 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=137)   So you already know the answers to these five basic questions. 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=142)   What is it? 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=144)   Concentration, clarity, equanimity, why practice it? 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=147)   Four sides of human happiness, how do you practice it? 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=150)   You need techniques, you need day-to-day practice, year-to-year practice, try to make it fun. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=160)   When did it develop? 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=161)   Well, it's still developing. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=163)   And where is it applied? 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=165)   It's applied to the human condition. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=170)   So that's the basic information. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=174)   And then some of the information I'm going to give you is details. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=187)   Detailed information. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=191)   Details about the what. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=195)   For each of concentration, clarity, and equanimity, the details are what it is, what it isn't, 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=205)   an example from your life, learning how to evoke examples from other people's lives. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=212)   There's a superficial view and a deep view for each of the skills. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=217)   And you've heard me talk about that, if not at this retreat, at other retreats. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=225)   So we've got detail about the what. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=228)   The detail about the why we talked about last night. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=233)   Here are the basic formula. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=238)   As you'll recall, mindful awareness leads to six factors that constitute, let's just 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=253)   say it's for you. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=256)   This is the happy pointing to you. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=260)   There's six things that are thought of as being, whoops, let's do it surface first. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=268)   Surface or ordinary human happiness. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=272)   And remember it was get pleasure in the body, avoid discomfort in the body, get various 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=281)   answers in the mind, avoid don't know mind in the mind, get situations that you want 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=293)   and avoid situations that you don't want. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=298)   This ordinary happiness plus deep happiness for yourself. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=306)   Deep happiness you remember the difference. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=310)   Here you want fulfillment, here you want to elevate fulfillment, you want to avoid suffering. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=318)   You want to get the answer and you want to be able to experience don't know mind as an 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=328)   okay thing. 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=333)   And then here instead of situations it's behavior. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=336)   You want to manifest a love cause and effect, positive behavior, cut down on negative objective 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=342)   behavior. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=343)   Those are the objective factors, these are the sensory factors. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=347)   This leads to a motivation to help other people. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=355)   And I mentioned why that is and what form that takes. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=361)   So this is a love of the human condition. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=367)   What I drew there, it was a heart and this is the Chinese character for humanity. 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=373)   This is bodhicitta. 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=378)   This leads to bodhicitta in the Buddhist context which then leads you to spread surface and 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=387)   deep happiness to others. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=394)   And all of this, this plus this and this equals total human happiness. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=407)   It's this plus this. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=408)   It's not just learning how to get fulfillment, it's also getting pleasure. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=415)   It's not just avoiding suffering, it's also avoiding discomfort. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=420)   It's not just getting enlightenment answers, it's getting these two, these together, the 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=426)   situations you want. 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=428)   So this plus this leading to this, leading to this. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=436)   You'll be happy in every way. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=441)   So that's details about happiness. 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=444)   Then there's, you already know all the details about the practice because it's on the game 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=451)   boards that we've been going over and over and over. 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=454)   That's where the details on that are. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=457)   So I said you'd have basic information, you'd have detailed information. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=465)   You're going to also have deep information. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=469)   There's certain deeper things. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=473)   Something about the how. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=475)   Remember that we talked about the deep game of mindfulness, the interplay of work with 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=480)   the parts, work with the whole, make distinctions, make unifications, active stance versus passive 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=491)   stance, the mutual complementarity of self and no self. 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=499)   That's sort of the deep game of how. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=502)   And then there's the deep where. 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=507)   We talked about this, I won't go into the details, but the forces that mold our sensory 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=513)   experience. 
<br>[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=517)   The surface forces of inner activation versus outer, that expansive, contractive pull, the 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=525)   mundane expansion and contraction, and then the deep, pure spirit, spatial spread and 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=531)   collapse, or in the paradigm of early Buddhism, the spontaneous rising and simultaneous passing 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=539)   when viewed from a temporal paradigm. 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=545)   That's a deep view of where. 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=547)   That's our sensory experience. 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=549)   That's the born in betweenness of time, space, and our sensory experience that inhabits it. 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=557)   So that's a deep perspective. 
<br>[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=559)   I'm going to give you deep information. 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=561)   And then I'm going to give you broad information, just for the fun of it. 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=566)   A broad context of the whole universe. 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=571)   Going to look at where these themes sort of fit in with what's known about the natural 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=579)   world. 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=581)   So these are the kinds of information I'm going to give you. 
<br>[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=586)   So we need a nice storage bin for this. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=591)   Hopefully one that sort of looks pretty, but also is intuitive so you'll know where information 
<br>[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=597)   is. 
<br>[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=599)   So we're going to have a basic box. 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=603)   No, let's not call it that. 
<br>[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=606)   Let's call it the center square. 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=609)   Isn't that a place in Boston? 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=613)   Center square? 
<br>[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=614)   Central square. 
<br>[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=616)   Central square. 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=617)   Sorry. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=618)   We'll call this central square. 
<br>[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=624)   And central square is going to store information about the what and the where and the when 
<br>[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=637)   and the how. 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=638)   All the basic stuff is in central square. 
<br>[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=642)   Now the details about the what is mindfulness, we're going to store in three boxes over here. 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=654)   And the details about why practice it, we're going to store up here. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=659)   And the details about how to practice it, we're going to store down over here. 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=665)   And then down here, we're going to make three yin-yang type shapes just because they're 
<br>[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=674)   pretty. 
<br>[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=678)   But they'll also contain some information that's sort of interesting. 
<br>[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=683)   So this then suggests that we could make a line here and a line here and a line here 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=689)   and a line here and make this into a nice little octagon. 
<br>[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=696)   So the details are in the octagon. 
<br>[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=699)   And the deep stuff is going to be in the second octagon. 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=707)   So we're going to draw a panel here. 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=710)   That's going to store deep. 
<br>[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=711)   Well, let's start with that. 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=712)   We're going to draw a panel here. 
<br>[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=716)   This is going to store deep information, the deep game of how. 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=721)   This panel here is going to store deep information about the where. 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=728)   This panel here and this panel here and then these circles here are going to store broad 
<br>[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=744)   information about the whole universe wherein we will see the themes of expansion and contraction 
<br>[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=755)   played out. 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=762)   So that suggests that we could sort of do something like this, like this, like this. 
<br>[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=770)   And we have a second nice little octagon. 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=777)   And we've got this and then it's going to be like this, and this and this and this. 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=786)   So see the general pattern here? 
<br>[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=790)   Your basic answers are here. 
<br>[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=793)   Details here. 
<br>[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=795)   Deep views here. 
<br>[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=799)   And then we're going to see the whole arc of the physical world from galaxies to atoms. 
<br>[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=812)   This one here. 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=814)   So get the general idea of how we're going to store information. 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=820)   It looks like a mandala very much, doesn't it? 
<br>[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=823)   In fact, mandalas have many levels of meaning. 
<br>[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=826)   One of them is that they're actually a palace of a god that you're looking from a bird's 
<br>[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=831)   eye view. 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=832)   And so there's four gates. 
<br>[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=835)   Yes, it's very much like a mandala. 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=844)   This is a cosmogram. 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=848)   It's a picture of the universe. 
<br>[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=851)   It's a psychogram. 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=852)   It's a picture of consciousness. 
<br>[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=855)   It is a hodogram, a picture of the path. 
<br>[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=861)   And it's an ideogram, I-D-I-O, not I-D-E-O. 
<br>[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=865)   I-D-E-O, an ideogram in that sense is like a Chinese character. 
<br>[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=871)   I-D-I-O-gram, that means a, ideo means personal or private. 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=877)   It's a picture of my mind. 
<br>[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=880)   It's an idiosyncratic psychogram. 
<br>[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=882)   What's the different part? 
<br>[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=885)   I'm sorry? 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=886)   What's the different part? 
<br>[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=887)   It's different from the rest of it. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=888)   That's a joke. 
<br>[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=889)   Oh, I see. 
<br>[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=890)   Good. 
<br>[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=891)   I failed the koan. 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=903)   So now here's what I'm going to do. 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=905)   I'm going to show you the actual thing. 
<br>[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=908)   I'm going to turn this board around, and you're going to see the giant thing. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=913)   But I'm warning you that even though it's pretty big, you can't make out the details. 
<br>[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=919)   Because all, by the way, all the information is stored in hieroglyphics, which you've seen 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=927)   all of them, OK, during these two weeks. 
<br>[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=930)   But you can't see them from where you're sitting. 
<br>[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=933)   But you will be able to see them from the sheet that I'm going to pass out to you. 
<br>[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=939)   And then you'll be able to follow everything. 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=941)   So I probably need some help twisting this around. 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=948)   Cool, huh? 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=955)   It's pretty, isn't it? 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=974)   Now, like I say, you can't see the symbols from where you are, even if you have good 
<br>[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=983)   vision. 
<br>[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=984)   I'm going to pass out something that you can look at. 
<br>[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=989)   But here it is. 
<br>[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=993)   Here is your senses, right? 
<br>[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=998)   Your conduct, how life treats you. 
<br>[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1002)   And the answer to the question, what is mindfulness? 
<br>[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1006)   Concentration, clarity, equanimity. 
<br>[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1010)   Why practice mindfulness? 
<br>[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1013)   Natural human happiness. 
<br>[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1016)   What's involved? 
<br>[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1017)   How do you practice mindfulness? 
<br>[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1019)   Techniques? 
<br>[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1020)   Daily cycle? 
<br>[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1021)   Yearly cycle? 
<br>[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1022)   Daily cycle? 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1023)   Have a good time. 
<br>[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1024)   What's the history of mindfulness? 
<br>[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1028)   Shamanic, prehistoric shamanic origins? 
<br>[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1031)   Historic meditative traditions? 
<br>[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1033)   Present research? 
<br>[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1035)   Possibly dawn of a new age? 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1041)   This is the basics. 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1042)   What, why, where, when? 
<br>[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1045)   Now the details. 
<br>[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1047)   Details on what. 
<br>[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1049)   What is concentration? 
<br>[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1050)   Well, I've given all the lectures. 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1054)   I'm not going to go into it. 
<br>[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1055)   But you know, there's what it is, what it isn't, instances, the deep view, and the taste, 
<br>[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1062)   and the same information for sensory clarity, and the same information for equanimity. 
<br>[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1068)   Details, notice it lines up one to one. 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1071)   Details about this you store here. 
<br>[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1075)   Details about this, there's the noting board. 
<br>[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1079)   There's the focus on positive board iconographically represented. 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1084)   Positive affect is smiling, positive behavior is legs, positive cognition is a brain. 
<br>[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1092)   Ideal or archetype is a holy figure. 
<br>[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1096)   Positive situation is a dawn. 
<br>[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1098)   I don't know, similar to this, but. 
<br>[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1100)   And then this is other, and you could do it in the visual auditory somatic. 
<br>[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1105)   We don't show the do nothing board because it's nothing. 
<br>[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1109)   And this box tells you the four kinds of information you can extract from these boxes. 
<br>[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1117)   There's strategies for formal practice. 
<br>[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1119)   There are ways of classifying, cutting up the pie of sensory experience. 
<br>[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1124)   There are ways of figuring out applications for certain jobs in the world. 
<br>[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1130)   How can I deal with this? 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1131)   How can I deal with that? 
<br>[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1133)   You can formulate your strategies, that's your toolkit. 
<br>[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1136)   And also it gives you a detailed view of the history. 
<br>[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1141)   That's a sundial. 
<br>[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1145)   You remember that we went through this whole thing and we outlined the whole history of 
<br>[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1149)   world contemplation based on these categories. 
<br>[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1152)   So these are the four types of information you can extract from the game boards. 
<br>[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1160)   So details about this, details about this. 
<br>[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1165)   What up here? 
<br>[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1166)   Details about Mr. Happy Head. 
<br>[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1171)   What's surface happiness? 
<br>[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1173)   Avoiding pain, getting pleasure, avoiding pain. 
<br>[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1178)   What's deep happiness? 
<br>[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1180)   Reducing pleasure times mindfulness. 
<br>[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1183)   And what's, instead of avoiding pain, you can experience pain divided by mindfulness, 
<br>[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1190)   reducing suffering. 
<br>[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1193)   What does the mind want? 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1195)   It wants to shine its light on all these different problems. 
<br>[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1198)   But what does it really want? 
<br>[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1200)   To shine its light on the socket that it's connected to. 
<br>[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1206)   What you think you want is to avoid don't know mind. 
<br>[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1211)   But what you really want is to be able to experience don't know mind as an empowerment. 
<br>[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1216)   What you think you want, which is valid, is good situations. 
<br>[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1220)   Sunny weather, not bad weather. 
<br>[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1222)   But what you really want, because it leads to these things, is positive behavior. 
<br>[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1230)   So if you get this for yourself, you're going to be very happy. 
<br>[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1235)   You ask me, what's the definition of enlightenment? 
<br>[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1237)   So this is a figure with a smiley face, but the outline is very diffuse. 
<br>[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1242)   There's no separation between inside and outside, no thinness to separate. 
<br>[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1248)   And a consequence of that is that you want to serve. 
<br>[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1253)   You want to serve materially. 
<br>[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1254)   You want to serve by, this is a mouth teaching mindfulness, mouth it, OK? 
<br>[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1261)   You give dana, you support those that serve materially, and you support those who teach. 
<br>[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1268)   So this gives you more information about this. 
<br>[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1272)   Now let's go deep. 
<br>[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1276)   This is deep, this is basics. 
<br>[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1278)   Detail, detail, detail. 
<br>[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1281)   This is just for decoration. 
<br>[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1285)   But it's sort of cool, because this reminds us that our sensory experience is a yin-yang thing. 
<br>[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1291)   And we see that in detail over here. 
<br>[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1296)   This reminds us that our path, our techniques, at a deep level arise through an interplay, 
<br>[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1304)   maybe not exactly yin-yang, but there's a little expansive contractive. 
<br>[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1308)   So this reminds us of the deep view over here. 
<br>[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1312)   This is practice, this is the deep view of practice. 
<br>[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1315)   The interplay of active versus passive. 
<br>[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1319)   Work with the parts, work with the whole. 
<br>[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1321)   Make discriminations, break discriminations. 
<br>[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1324)   Manifest a self, go into the no self. 
<br>[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1329)   So this is the sort of the yin-yang, the inner game of practice is here. 
<br>[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1337)   And the sort of yin-yang of sensory experience, the basic molding forces, the tug of subjective 
<br>[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1345)   versus objective activation, the surface manifestations of expansion and contraction, the deep manifestations 
<br>[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1353)   of expansion and contraction, and the effortless activity of time itself, rising and passing 
<br>[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1361)   simultaneously, these are the forces, superficial and deep, that mold sensory experience. 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1368)   So this is the doorway to the deep view on this. 
<br>[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1375)   This is the doorway to the deep view on this. 
<br>[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1379)   And this is the doorway to the deep view on the universe, displayed here. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1391)   The title of the universe is Omega, which is related to the cosmological constant. 
<br>[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1402)   It's the number, it's the interplay of expansion and contraction that molds the universe as 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1407)   a whole. 
<br>[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1408)   And the universe is, at the finest scale, the smallest spatial scale, is the Planck. 
<br>[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1417)   And then this thing with the dot, this circumpunk, represents all the structures that arise in 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1425)   between the universe as a whole and the Planck scale, the cosmic space scale and the Planck 
<br>[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1434)   spatial scale. 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1435)   There's all these structures that sort of seem to reflect a contractive core and an 
<br>[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1441)   expansive cloud or something along those lines. 
<br>[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1446)   And what are they? 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1447)   Galaxies, supermassive black hole. 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1450)   In the center, effusive cloud of stars. 
<br>[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1453)   Suns, we talked about it, born in between the expansion of thermal photon pressure and 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1458)   the contraction of self-gravity. 
<br>[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1459)   Planets, core-mantle atmosphere interactions cause the in and out of the core and mantle 
<br>[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1476)   cause the surface continents to flow. 
<br>[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1479)   The rising and falling of thermal currents cause the weather to flow. 
<br>[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1488)   The human being, anatomically, it's got nerves that input. 
<br>[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1495)   There's process in the brain. 
<br>[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1497)   Motor goes out. 
<br>[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1500)   The heart and the capillaries, it's an expansive contraction thing. 
<br>[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1506)   We have a similar kind of structure. 
<br>[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1509)   And in our complicated, of all creatures, we are the ones that are most aware of the 
<br>[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1514)   input output in terms of cause and effect. 
<br>[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1520)   And so we live very much in that world also. 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1524)   The cell, I gave a whole talk about how the cell is formed by a lipid bilayer with polar 
<br>[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1536)   ends sticking out into the watery environment on the outside and the watery environment 
<br>[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1542)   on the inside, creating an inside-outside situation. 
<br>[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1550)   Then macromolecules like proteins with nonpolar core and surrounded by polar radicals. 
<br>[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1564)   And so what do those polar radicals do? 
<br>[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1568)   Well, they can migrate into this membrane and start to create very complex interactions 
<br>[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1576)   that are input output of energy and matter and information into the cell. 
<br>[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1585)   That same sort of deal. 
<br>[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1588)   Contractive core surrounded by this halo and then atoms look very much in some ways like 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1595)   galaxies. 
<br>[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1596)   And at the base of it is the mathematics. 
<br>[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1600)   The operations of mathematics, which all have the same basic structure, just different flavor. 
<br>[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1608)   It's an intertwining of three kinds of polarizing and canceling activities. 
<br>[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1620)   You have step forward, step back, don't move. 
<br>[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1633)   You have stretch out, pull in, don't move. 
<br>[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1638)   You have whirl this way, whirl that way, don't move. 
<br>[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1642)   All the movements of the dancer are represented by the mathematics and therefore the fact 
<br>[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1658)   that the mathematics seems to have this polarization cancellation type of situation shouldn't surprise 
<br>[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1670)   us because we've discovered it in our own sensory experience seems to be something very 
<br>[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1678)   fundamental about the way that, so it's sort of at the base of what models all of this. 
<br>[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1688)   There was a famous bio mathematician named Haldane, H-A-L-D-A-N-E as an Englishman. 
<br>[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1698)   And this was back in I guess the Victorian or Edwardian period, maybe not quite that 
<br>[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1706)   old, but back there, early 19th century, he was active. 
<br>[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1712)   Someone once asked him, based on his study of mathematics and biology, had he been able 
<br>[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1721)   to discern any characteristics of the creator? 
<br>[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1726)   Could he say anything about God's personality based on his development of this field of 
<br>[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1734)   bio mathematics? 
<br>[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1735)   And he said, yes. 
<br>[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1740)   As far as I can see, the main characteristic of God is that he has an inordinate fondness 
<br>[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1747)   for beetles. 
<br>[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1751)   But actually, I would paraphrase Haldane, I think God has an inordinate fondness for 
<br>[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1762)   contrast and cancellation. 
<br>[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1767)   That seems to be the pattern that we see very broadly. 
<br>[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1773)   And that is everything important that I know. 
<br>[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1780)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvcERLhPXt0&t=1781)   And now, you know it.
