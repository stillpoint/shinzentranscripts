title: "Taking Temperature of Subconscious Processing ~ SHINZEN YOUNG"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=0)   One of my favorite jokes, well not jokes, but just funny things that I'll ask someone 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=19)   is, do you think that, like you look at a neon light bulb, neon, or that kind of thing, 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=30)   you can touch it, right? 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=32)   It's cold. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=35)   But I'll say, do you believe me that the temperature inside that neon bulb is comparable to the 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=49)   temperature in the core of the sun? 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=54)   Most people would say, no way, right? 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=56)   But actually it is. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=58)   The thing is, there just aren't very many molecules in there. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=62)   So it doesn't transfer much heat to you. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=65)   But they're plasma. 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=70)   They're like they're on the sun. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=75)   They're moving that fast. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=76)   But it has very little density. 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=81)   So you touch it, they don't transfer hardly any heat to you at all. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=85)   So you have no perception of how really much energy there is on average. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=95)   But like I say, high average kinetic energy. 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=98)   But if you don't have a lot of particles, then the total energy they're going to transfer 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=102)   to the surface of that bulb is not very much. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=106)   So anyway, end of physics lesson. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=111)   What is the metaphor? 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=112)   Well, you'll recall that Freud thought of the psyche in terms of pressures, because 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=122)   that was sort of the physics of the day. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=131)   What I find interesting is that if you parse your mental experience into a visual component, 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=145)   which would be mental images, and an auditory component, which would be mental talk, when 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=152)   you start to do that, you're aware of images. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=160)   A lot of times they vanish right away. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=162)   You're aware of talk. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=164)   Sometimes it just vanishes. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=166)   But at some point, that sort of surface activity tends to go away. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=173)   But the space, image space, is still there. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=177)   Talk space is still there. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=179)   And when you tune into image space or talk space, sometimes you're aware of a kind of 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=188)   subtle undercurrent of motion, like there's a kind of stirring in talk space. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=195)   You may or may not be able to make out words. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=198)   You may or may not be able to make out what the conversation is about. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=204)   But there's a sort of undercurrent of activation. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=208)   And there's something analogous to that in image space. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=216)   And there can also be something analogous to that in your emotional centers. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=222)   You're not actually experiencing any emotion per se, but it's like there's something sort 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=228)   of idling down there. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=233)   So what is that? 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=235)   A lot of times people will sort of look upon that as a problem. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=241)   It's like, I can't get rid of that sort of undercurrent of something going on down there. 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=249)   Well what that is, is subconscious visual thought, subconscious auditory thought, and 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=260)   subliminal emotional sensation. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=267)   And if you explore your inner space, image space, talk space, emotional body space, after 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=277)   the surface stuff is sort of dissipated, and you're watching that general level of stirring 
<br>[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=288)   down there, sometimes it's uniform. 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=294)   It just sort of is at a constant pace. 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=300)   Other times it sort of speeds up and then subsides, sort of bursts and then subsides. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=309)   So although you're not aware of the specific content necessarily of the subconscious, you 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=319)   are monitoring, by monitoring that general level of activation. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=326)   Do you see the metaphor? 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=330)   You're taking the temperature of the subconscious. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=334)   You're monitoring sort of metaphorically the average kinetic energy that's going on. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=342)   And if the temperature is more or less constant, it's all sort of at the same frequency, then 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=353)   what's optimal is to evenly cover subjective space and just let your awareness sort of 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=361)   soak into that whole field. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=365)   And what that's going to tend to do is break up the, it's going to lessen the viscosity. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=381)   So density, viscosity, temperature, entropy, these are called state variables. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=390)   And these are sort of the, this is the great achievement of 19th century physics. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=398)   One of the great achievements is statistical thermodynamics. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=403)   So there are these state variables. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=406)   So if it's more or less like an even level of vibratory activity, then you sort of cover 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=415)   the whole space. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=416)   You soak awareness into it. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=418)   You don't try to figure out what's going on. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=421)   You give it permission to just sort of move around down there. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=427)   And you'll find that that will cause that system to become more and more fluid, meaning 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=435)   less and less viscous. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=440)   On the other hand, if you notice pattern that it sort of activates and then deactivates, 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=446)   so it sort of like heats up and then suddenly cools off, metaphorically. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=453)   What's optimal in that case is to watch the sort of burst of energy and then detect the 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=460)   gone and briefly look down the valley where those little bubbles went to, because they're 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=467)   pointing right to nirvana, right to cessation. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=471)   So you get gone, gone, gone, gone. 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=476)   If it gives you that pattern, then get interested in the rhythm of arising, passing, arising, 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=483)   passing. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=484)   But this is subtle vibration, sort of shimmering and then dying away. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=489)   And when that foam sort of dies away, the silence that it points to is the absolute 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=497)   rest, the still point of the turning world. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=502)   So there's a metaphor from good old 19th century physics. 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=513)   I mentioned that, so in my mind, I think of this as, well, how cool is this? 
<br>[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=520)   If Freud had only known you can actually take the temperature in real time of the subconscious 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=525)   mind. 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=528)   And in doing so, the viscosity of the subconscious gets worked through. 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=535)   And when the subconscious self, the psyche, this inner see, hear, feel self, when it flows, 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=547)   it gets creative and liberated. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=555)   So that's one of my favorite metaphors, taking the temperature of the unconscious in real 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=564)   time as a function of space. 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=570)   Temperature of this room is what a scientist would call a scalar field. 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=575)   It means, or a time varying scalar field, means at each point in the space of this room, 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=584)   there's a physical quantity that can be measured by one real number, which is temperature. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=593)   And it's a temperature field, a scalar field that varies with time. 
<br>[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=599)   So the subconscious is actually analogous to a temperature field, because it has location. 
<br>[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZABGqiLrc&t=608)   There's the visual part, the auditory part, the emotional body part, and so forth. 
<br>
