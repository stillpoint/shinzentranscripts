<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=0)   OK, now, if I say I am stressed, I'm stressed, I've got my mind is spinning, 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=15)   and I would like to be able to use some of your meditation techniques 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=22)   to just help me in like 5 or 10 minutes. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=25)   Is there something that I could do to, like, this program sounds wonderful, 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=30)   like a great support in the long run, and you talked about this daily practice, 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=34)   but what's something I can do, like, right now that would just help my stress level? 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=41)   You mean like literally right now? 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=43)   Yes, literally right now, this instant. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=46)   OK. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=47)   Is there something I could do? 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=48)   Yes, I will guide you in a practice. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=52)   OK. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=53)   So, for that, I'd like you to... 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=55)   What do I do? 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=56)   Well, you sit up. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=57)   OK. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=58)   Does it matter how my hands go? 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=59)   No, just comfortable, whatever. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=62)   Lengthen your spine. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=63)   OK. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=64)   Let your whole body settle. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=65)   Close your eyes. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=68)   And I'm going to briefly describe some options as to how we can work, 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=76)   and then you can choose which one you want to do, OK? 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=79)   OK. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=80)   So, one thing that we can do, I'll go through a brief description of the five ways, 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=87)   and then I'll let you choose. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=88)   Are my eyes still closed? 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=89)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=90)   OK. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=91)   You can keep your eyes closed and just sort of be settling in 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=94)   and sort of digest the information I give you, 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=99)   and then you can choose which of the focusing methods you want to do. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=103)   OK. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=104)   So, one of the ways is focus in, and that involves observing your thoughts and emotions 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=116)   by dividing your subjective experience into feel, image, talk. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=122)   So that's emotional body sensation, mental picture, and auditory thoughts, self-talk, that kind of thing. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=130)   So one of the methods we can use is to break your emotional and, in general, your subjective experience, 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=138)   your thoughts, your feelings, your reactions, and such. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=143)   We can break them into manageable pieces. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=145)   It's sort of like divide and conquer. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=149)   So that's focus in, working with your subjective experience. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=153)   Alternatively, we can explore the power of now by doing the opposite, 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=159)   letting go of feel, image, talk, and anchoring yourself in external sights, external sounds, 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=167)   and physical-type body sensations, touch, sight, sound. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=171)   So that's always the present. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=173)   Feel, image, talk might be memory, plan, fantasy, but touch, sight, sound are always now. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=180)   You've probably heard of the power of now. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=182)   So that's one way to experience, in a tangible way, the power of now, is by focusing out on touch, sight, sound. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=190)   So that's two possibilities, focus in, feel, image, talk, focus out, touch, sight, sound. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=196)   Another possibility we talked about earlier is focus on restful states to sort of cool out. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=201)   Another possibility is to focus on how things constantly change, the dynamic side of experience, 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=208)   how things flow and vanish. We'll call that focus on change. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=213)   So you can focus in, focus out, focus on rest, focus on change. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=218)   Or the final possibility is that you can intentionally cultivate positive states of thought and emotion. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=227)   So instead of just observing feel, image, talk, you can proactively create positive feel, image, or talk, 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=235)   and then sort of radiate that positivity, sort of the power of positive thinking kind of thing. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=240)   We'll call that focus on positives. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=242)   So those are the five ways, they're fundamentally contrasting strategies. 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=248)   And I'd like you to choose if you'd like to focus in, focus out, focus on rest, focus on change, or focus on positives. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=257)   And then I'll guide you in that regard. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=260)   All of those could be good for working with stress. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBP54XrKC-Q&t=263)   Each in a different way.
