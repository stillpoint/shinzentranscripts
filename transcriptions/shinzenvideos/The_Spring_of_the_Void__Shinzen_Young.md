<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=0)   So, what prompted me to bring up that koan was this little fellow here, okay, because 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=25)   I can't think of a better iconic representation of enlightenment than this. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=34)   Okay, there we go. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=38)   Yeah, it's fun, isn't it? 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=41)   It is fun. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=42)   Why is it fun? 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=43)   Why do we like watching this? 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=46)   There is a reason, and it's called Helmholtz free energy, I'm reasonably sure. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=59)   I would say that we all ride on a kind of effortless just happeningness that is the 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=78)   nature of consciousness. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=80)   So when I say the word emptiness within, say, the Buddhist context, what image comes to 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=91)   your mind? 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=93)   Well, maybe an image of vastness. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=100)   I would say that's not incorrect, but it's exactly half the picture. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=107)   I think for a lot of people, when they hear Buddhists talk about emptiness, the image 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=113)   that comes to their mind is some sort of bleakness. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=123)   It's like you bust your buns for 40 years on the cushion and what do you have to show 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=128)   for it? 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=129)   Emptiness. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=130)   It's like, what? 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=131)   Maybe that's another rabbi and Roshi joke. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=147)   The Roshi says we attain emptiness. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=152)   The rabbi says, that's garnished. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=155)   Okay, you have to know Yiddish. 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=160)   Garnished means bubkus. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=164)   It means who wants that? 
<br>[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=167)   It's nothing. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=169)   Okay. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=170)   However, when I first encountered the word emptiness, I was a student of Buddhism academically. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=181)   Dongbanye in Tibetan, Shunyata in Sanskrit, Kong in Mandarin Chinese, Ku in Sino-Japanese. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=193)   I knew it in many Asian languages. 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=197)   It was just this weird idea that I didn't have any image of. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=202)   It's like, what the heck? 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=206)   As I say, a lot of people probably think of bleakness, some people think of vastness. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=214)   But the reason I so like this little tchotchke that Charlie brought is for many, many years 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=226)   now when I use the word emptiness and when I hear the word emptiness within the Buddhist 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=234)   context, this is exactly what my image is. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=240)   Bounciness, springiness. 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=247)   In 1660, Robert Boyle wrote a foundational work on pressure. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=261)   And a year later, he wrote a foundational work on chemistry, which interestingly he 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=267)   called the skeptical chemist. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=271)   It was a scathing critique of Aristotelian and Paracelsian alchemy, essentially, and 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=280)   is thought of as the beginning of modern chemistry. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=284)   But the year before he wrote that, he wrote something that was subtitled, and I just love 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=293)   the title of this, Touching the Spring of the Air. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=301)   That's how they, back in those days, talked about pressure. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=306)   It's like the springiness of the air, touching the spring of the air. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=312)   And that is what the experience of emptiness is for me as a meditative experience. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=324)   It's directly touching the spring of the void. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUjCGG31YSo&t=332)   And so I just mention this as something to know about.
