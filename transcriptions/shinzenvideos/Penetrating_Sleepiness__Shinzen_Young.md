<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=0)   For the sleepiness stuff, well, read and reread until you master completely what I have to 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=13)   say in the blog from fuzz to buzz. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=18)   That's on the internet and that's the brain dump of everything that I know for how to 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=23)   work with syncing. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=27)   So syncing is the generic term for anything from getting a little hazy in your consciousness 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=38)   to the zemlurge and the, you know, the snoring in the zendo and so forth. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=48)   That whole continuum we call syncing. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=51)   Konjin in Japanese means, kon means dark and jin means to like sink down to the bottom 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=61)   of the pond. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=63)   So konjin is like sinking in English. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=67)   So for syncing over and over again, straighten the spine, over and over again, force the 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=74)   eyes open, over and over again, enjoy the pleasant restfulness of the waves of sleepiness, 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=82)   over and over again, equanimize the discomfort of the sleepiness. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=88)   And you just keep doing that and doing that and doing that. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=90)   And I know it's hard to believe and I certainly didn't believe it, but you can eventually 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=96)   penetrate the sensory event of sleepiness. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=100)   And when you do that, then that's a sensory experience and there's the objective circumstance 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=109)   of, you know, you're wilting, you're lurching and you're breathing heavily, etc. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=117)   When you penetrate the sensory event of sleepiness, then the objective aspects of the sleepiness, 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=124)   the loss of consciousness, the impact on the posture and the fact that you start to make 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=130)   noise, that all gets cleared up. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=134)   I remember one of my early retreats in Japan, of course, I was dominated by the pain of 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=146)   the sitting and I went to talk to the person that was like leading the retreat and he said, 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=156)   I've been meditating, this is him talking, I've been meditating now for 25 years and, 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=165)   you know, eventually the pain breaks up. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=175)   But then he said sleepiness is very hard to deal with. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=180)   The pain is going to break up, but sleepiness may continue to be a challenge. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=185)   Well, now that conversation took place 40 years ago and I can tell you that the sleepiness 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=195)   breaks up too. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reLjQ2iSvBE&t=198)   Just keep working and working and working and you'll see improvements in that regard.
