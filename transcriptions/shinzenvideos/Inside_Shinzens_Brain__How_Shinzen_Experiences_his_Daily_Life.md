title: "Inside Shinzen's Brain:  How Shinzen Experiences his Daily Life"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=0)   I'm interested in what happens inside your brain in any given day. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=12)   Obviously from doing this practice for as long as you've been doing it, 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=18)   you're functioning in a different way. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=21)   And I remember you telling me of how they hooked you up one time 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=25)   to get your brain studied at the University of Arizona. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=30)   And the technician came in to you and said, 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=35)   now don't start meditating yet until we turn on the equipment. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=39)   And you said, as if I could stop. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=42)   And you used the analogy of saying it's as if you asked someone with a lot of muscles 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=48)   to just don't have muscles for a minute. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=50)   It's so much a part of how you function. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=53)   I'd like you to give me a taste of what it's like inside your brain 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=61)   in any given day as best you can. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=65)   Just in terms of your processing, 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=68)   I know you've talked about meditating in the visual field. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=73)   I would just be, if you could just give me a taste of how you process your experience 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=81)   and what's deliberate, applying a technique and what just happens. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=86)   If I were to give the big picture of what my days are like, 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=93)   I would say that typically on any given day, 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=100)   my experience ranges from a scattered and unconscious, 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=108)   in a sense as though I had never meditated. 
<br>[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=112)   I'm choosing my words carefully. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=115)   In a sense as though I had never meditated. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=118)   It ranges from that to a direct contact with the spiritual source involving 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=130)   literally seeing through this world as I'm bopping around within it, 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=137)   which is also an experience of myself and the world arising from and returning to the source. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=149)   So my experience ranges between something like a person that has never meditated 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=158)   and something like absolute oneness with absolute fulfillment. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=168)   It ranges between those. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=173)   The main feature, what the impact of the 40 years of practice is, 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=179)   is I don't have much preference between those two states. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=186)   Someone once asked a Roshi in my presence what his definition of enlightenment is. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=195)   He said, 
<br>[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=197)   悟りと悟りでないとの区別がなくなることでしょう。 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=203)   Which in Japanese means, I guess you could say enlightenment is the passing away 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=209)   of the distinction between enlightenment and non-enlightenment. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=214)   That was Mayuzumi Roshi, a very famous Roshi in Los Angeles. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=219)   He has many students all over the world, great students that are doing great work. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=225)   So anyway, it ranges from completely deluded to quasi-enlightened without a preference between those. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=236)   And that's what's just naturally arising, that's not with an applied effort of any... 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=243)   That's correct. If there's an applied effort, 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=245)   then obviously it starts to valence towards that state of energy and emptiness. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=254)   But the main feature in daily life is there's not a preference, 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=258)   which is in stark contrast to when I began my practice, 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=262)   and probably in stark contrast to just about where everyone begins, 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=267)   because when you begin, you want something. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=269)   You want to think you're getting somewhere. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=271)   You want certain experiences. 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=273)   So my early years of practice were preoccupied with comparing maps 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=280)   and finding every possible experience and every description, 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=285)   and then needing to have all of those experiences, 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=287)   and wanting to have this or that happen. 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=290)   Which is what I think a lot of people... 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=293)   You've got to start somewhere, so that's sort of natural. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=296)   So I would say the biggest change that has taken place is that 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=301)   I don't have that big a preference between enlightenment and non-enlightenment. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=307)   That's sort of the big picture. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=309)   Then if I'm intending to meditate in action, in life, 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=317)   like I'm talking to you now, okay. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=319)   So if I'm going to be intentionally meditating, 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=322)   now I just started to intentionally meditate as we're talking. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=325)   I typically meditate in the external visual field, 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=330)   and I typically am meditating on the process of simultaneous expansion and contraction, 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=337)   causing the world in front of me to arise and then disappear. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=341)   So I'm now applying a formal technique. 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=344)   So I'm arising and disappearing right now. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=346)   You're arising and disappearing from the source, moment by moment. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=349)   Therefore, you appear to me to be the source, and therefore very effortlessly lovable. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=356)   I'll take it. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=362)   But no more lovable than the flower next to you or the garbage can outside. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=371)   So that would be, now if I'm doing formal practice where I'm seated and my eyes are closed, 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=381)   I will do any of the five ways that I teach. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=384)   I use all my own techniques, just sort of depending on interest, opportunity, and necessity. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=391)   Although recently I've been tending to default to the technique that I call do-nothing, 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=398)   the do-nothing technique. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=401)   That's what I've been using recently for my own formal practice. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=405)   That's a version of focus on rest in terms of a five-way formulation that I use. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=413)   When you were talking about everything dissolving into and having no preference, 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=419)   you could in a sense define it in light, because you said, 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=422)   I now have no preference for enlightenment or not enlightenment, 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=426)   but is enlightenment then this process of the having no preference? 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=431)   That's a stage. 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=434)   In other words, first when you start, enlightenment is a figure and the world is a ground. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=441)   You and the world are the ground and you have this fantasy of enlightenment that's a figure. 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=446)   At some point there's a shift, a figure-ground reversal, 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=452)   and you and your world are the figure, and the actual experience of enlightenment is the ground. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=460)   You may go through many years and in fact decades of preferring to be in that state, 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=469)   but then that tends to pass away with time. 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=473)   If you want to know what I'm preoccupied with, I am preoccupied just like anybody. 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=480)   If somebody wakes up and they're preoccupied with money or their health or sex or drugs or whatever, 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=488)   I'm preoccupied. 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=490)   There's something I default to as a sort of obsession. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=496)   If you understand that's somewhat in quotes, but it would be my version of being obsessed. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=502)   What obsession is in my consciousness. 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=505)   The obsession is, can I figure out better ways to bring masses of people to what I experience? 
<br>[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=516)   That's what I default to. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=518)   It's like, how smart can I be? How creative can I be in the service of the world? 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvekcxNASGs&t=527)   Not a bad default. 
<br>
