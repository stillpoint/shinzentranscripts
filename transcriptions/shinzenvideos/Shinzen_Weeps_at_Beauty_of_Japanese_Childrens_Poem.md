title: "Shinzen Weeps at Beauty of Japanese Children's Poem"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=0)   Because, just as you had to learn the ABCs, every Japanese child has to learn the Iroha. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=12)   The Iroha is the traditional ordering of the Japanese script. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=21)   Hiragana, are you aware that Japanese language is written in a combination of kanji, which 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=29)   are Chinese characters, and kana, which are Japanese syllables, syllabary. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=37)   There's two kinds of kana, but the one that's normally used is called Hiragana. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=44)   The way that school children learn Hiragana is they learn a poem. 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=51)   A poem that contains each syllable of the Japanese language once and only once. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=59)   And that poem is traditionally ascribed to Kobo Daishi, also known as Kukai. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=71)   And Kukai was the person who introduced Shingon into Japan from China. 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=78)   And he developed his linguistic sophistication because he studied a little Sanskrit. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=89)   And the Sanskrit, Panini and such, he was, the people in India invented grammar, really. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=99)   The world's first scientific grammarian was Panini. 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=104)   And because Shingon uses mantras a lot, and so they wanted to know Sanskrit, so they actually 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=111)   learned phonological principles. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=115)   They meaning the monks, the Shingon monks. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=117)   And they learned it based on Indic notions of linguistics. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=124)   So there was an indirect impact all the way from India, all the way to Japan, when the 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=138)   Japanese written language was first sort of developing in the Heian period. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=143)   It was Shingon monks that did it because they had linguistic sophistication. 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=149)   They created the equivalent of their alphabet. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=154)   And so whereas you learn the ABCs, a Japanese child learns this poem. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=163)   Iro wa nioedo, chirinuru wo, wagayo tarezo tsunemaru, ui no okuyaba kyo koete, asaki yume 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=184)   michi e mo sezu. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=185)   That contains each syllable of the Japanese language exactly once. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=189)   And then you memorize that poem, and you learn the kana that way. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=194)   And that's the direct influence of Shingon on the Japanese language, which is absolutely 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=199)   indelible. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=202)   Every Japanese person knows it. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=206)   So what does the poem mean? 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=210)   It's very interesting. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=215)   Iro means color, Iro wa nioedo, although the colors are bright, chirinuru wo, the flower 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=227)   will eventually fall to the ground. 
<br>[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=232)   Wagayo, in this world of ours, tarezo, who, tsunemaru, can expect to live forever. 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=248)   Ui no okuyaba. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=254)   Ui is the name of, this is really incredibly beautiful. 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=258)   Ui is the name of a place, but it's a pun also. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=264)   Ui no okuyaba, maybe you know what yama means in Japanese. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=268)   What does it mean? 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=271)   Mountain. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=272)   Okuyama means furthest mountains. 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=275)   So ui no okuyama kyo koete. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=282)   Today I crossed over the furthest mountain of ui, but it's a pun because ui also means 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=293)   sanskrita dharma, as a technical term in Buddhism. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=299)   Sanskrita dharma is compounded things. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=304)   You've probably heard this, okay? 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=307)   Things that arise due to causality, anything other than nirvana is a compounded thing. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=314)   So ui no okuyama, today, ui no okuyama kyo koete, today crossing the farthest mountain 
<br>[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=323)   of the village of ui, asaki yume miji, no longer will I be subject to superficial dreams, 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=339)   ei mosesu, nor will I be intoxicated anymore. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=346)   It's a whole talk about impermanence and enlightenment. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=351)   That's how every Japanese child learns their alphabet, to this day. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=357)   Little if your culture. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=361)   You don't want to know what I know. 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVFJznSgLd8&t=370)   So ui no okuyama kyo koete, asaki yume miji, ei mosesu.
