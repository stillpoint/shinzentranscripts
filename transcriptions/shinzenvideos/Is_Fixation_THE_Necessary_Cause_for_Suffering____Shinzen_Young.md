title: "Is Fixation 'THE' Necessary Cause for Suffering?   ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=0)   You'll recall our conversation about necessary causes. I find this very interesting because, 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=15)   as I mentioned, one layer of necessary cause can have a deeper layer of necessary cause 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=24)   underneath it that may or may not be evident until we investigate. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=32)   So Sasaki Roshi, who as we speak is 104 years old, the oldest living Buddhist master and 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=43)   still has a complete functional teaching load at that age, he talks about a necessary cause 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=51)   for suffering also. It's clearly related to tanha, but it's not the same word. He doesn't 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=59)   use that very often. There is a word in Japanese that means tanha, shujaku. But I've hardly 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=68)   ever heard him talk about shujaku. Instead he says, jiko wo kotei suru koto wa yoroshiku 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=80)   nai, meaning it is not a good thing to fixate the self. He talks about fixation as a necessary 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=91)   cause of suffering. All you have to do is unlearn the habit of fixation and you can 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=97)   pass all the koans and you will be enlightened and happy. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=105)   So what I find interesting in this formulation is that he uses a related but different word, 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=115)   subtly but significantly different word for the necessary cause for suffering. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=119)   And it doesn't have the connotation for the positive. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=124)   Well it has a very different, I mean if you say craving it has a certain reverberation. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=132)   If you say fixation, even though it's related, it has another reverberation. And the reverberation 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=140)   of fixation is well that's starting to sound like a global physical parameter in the information 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=147)   processing circuitry of the nervous system. A global physical parameter. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=153)   I mean I got it. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=155)   Examples of global physical parameters in nature would be viscosity in a hydrodynamic 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=162)   system or resistance or impedance in an electrical system. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=176)   Didn't the Buddha talk about a potter's wheel having friction? 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=185)   I seem to vaguely remember a metaphor like that but I don't remember the specific. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=189)   It's like the potter's wheel if it has friction versus when it moves smoothly. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=194)   We're going to have to look that up. That sounds extremely interesting if you would 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=198)   find that for me. That might be, wow, we should definitely look that up. That's a homework 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=204)   assignment. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=205)   There we go. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=209)   And actually friction in a mechanical system. So if something analogous to electrical resistance 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=223)   or hydrodynamic viscosity or friction and so forth, if something analogous to that is 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=236)   also a necessary cause for suffering, then that sort of makes us think, well, that's 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=243)   starting to sound more like talking about the brain and the nervous system. Whereas 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=250)   craving is somewhat, I mean, sure, we know there are centers, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=256)   Right, and we're connected to a sense of self that's craving versus fixation that 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=259)   something's happening in the system. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=261)   That's sort of like something that either happens, in nature things freeze, they melt. 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=268)   So what is particularly interesting is if we think about a parameter like what's called 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=276)   the Reynolds number. Now this is a characteristic of flow systems. There's a way of computing 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=290)   a parameter which characterizes the flow regimen, flow regime. So I won't go into the details 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=301)   obviously, but if you have a flow field and its Reynolds number exceeds a certain value 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=308)   then it goes turbulent. But if it isn't at that level, it's smooth and laminar. 
<br>[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=318)   So if suffering were analogous to turbulence in the flow of the senses, I'm not saying 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=328)   it is, but let's say it were, then we could model. And if non-turbulence, or if the turbulence 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=354)   was dependent on some sort of parameter that we could identify with the physical functioning 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=360)   of the nervous system. For example, there's something called the attentional blink, which 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=367)   I won't go into the details, but it basically measures how much fixation there is in your 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=372)   moment by moment concentration. And that can be measured now with science. 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=378)   By the movement of the eye you mean? 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=381)   No, I mean it's a blink metaphorically, not physically. That's why I say I'm not going 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=387)   to go into details. There's a lot to say about it. You can look it up on the internet. But 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=392)   essentially it's something that can be measured now with reaction times. And it's physical, 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=401)   it's not subjective. It can be objectively measured and it's thought to correlate with 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=406)   the degree to which one is inappropriately holding on to things. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=411)   Really? 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=412)   Yes. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=413)   Wow. 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=414)   And therefore... 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=415)   But there's a judgment there, appropriate and inappropriate. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=419)   Well, no there's not, and that's why I'm not going to go into the whole... 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=423)   Got it, got it. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=424)   Basically, well I guess I have to now. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=426)   I'm sorry. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=429)   Let's say that you're given a sequence of sensory events, and your job is to track the 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=435)   sensory events. If you inappropriately hold on to a previous event, you're going to blink 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=445)   or miss the arising of the next event. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=448)   Oh yeah. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=449)   So what they found is in meditators, there's less of that. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=453)   Oh, okay. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=455)   Seeming to indicate... 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=457)   And it's more presence? 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=459)   Well, it's related to sensory clarity, but it's also related to the equanimity of not 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=464)   inappropriately holding. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=467)   So we're already beginning to get some... 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=470)   And this is completely objective. It doesn't require any self-report, because it's either 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=475)   sought or you didn't. I mean, that's a self-report, but it's not really because they present it 
<br>[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=482)   and you either click or you don't. 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=485)   It's not like, well yeah, I remembered that, I'm going to tell you. So it's very objective 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=493)   in what it's measuring. Now I'm not saying that that correlates to what Sasaki Roshi 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=499)   calls fixation, but it's already beginning to be a glow... It doesn't matter what you're 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=505)   attending to, this phenomenon could be in any of the senses. It's already beginning 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=510)   to look at possibly another necessary cause for suffering. If something like the attentional 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=518)   blink is related to what Sasaki Roshi calls fixation, and then you can untrain that, or 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=528)   maybe cause an intervention that prevents it of some sort. I don't know what, but let's 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=537)   say it's possible to do that. 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=539)   Now we're talking about eliminating other kinds of necessary causes for suffering. Or 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=547)   let's just say that we take the early Buddhist one, tanha. So when you have tanha, all you've 
<br>[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=560)   got to do to experience nirvana is get rid of tanha. In other words, all you've got to 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=568)   do is knock that card and the house of cards that is the suffering falls. 
<br>[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=574)   Let's say that what the Buddha called tanha is actually on the second tier of that house 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=583)   of cards. Let's say that at a deeper tier, there's something that has to happen physiologically 
<br>[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=592)   in your nervous system for tanha to arise. Hypothetically, that is not unreasonable. 
<br>[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=603)   That means any and all tanha, not just craving for cocaine or shopping, but any and all. 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=610)   Let's say that there is a necessary cause behind the necessary cause. And the necessary 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=618)   cause that is behind a necessary cause is completely neurophysiological in nature. Then 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=628)   there could be interventions that directly address that neurophysiological. 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=632)   So you knock out the physiological necessary condition for tanha, therefore you knock out 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=644)   tanha, therefore you knock out what blocks perfection. So theoretically, or potentially, 
<br>[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=655)   any piece of research into craving, if it were done very deeply, might unlock a key 
<br>[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=668)   physiological mechanism. What I find interesting is that you can't get much funding for research 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=679)   on enlightenment, but you can get funding for research on drug addiction. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=691)   But if research on drug addiction were to go very, very deep and very, very broad, it's 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=701)   possible that the necessary cause for tanha could be found and eliminated. Which would 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=710)   mean, if we take the Buddhist model, that there would be a physiological, and don't 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=719)   ask me what kind, because I don't know. If I did know, I'd get the Nobel Prize. I have 
<br>[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=723)   no idea. Is it some super kind of biofeedback? Is it fMRI biofeedback? Is it TMS stimulation? 
<br>[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=731)   Is it what they call DREADS, which sounds bad, but they're like these... 
<br>[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=737)   Sounds like a hair stand. 
<br>[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=739)   No, it's designer drugs for designer receptors. It's like the cutting edge of the cutting 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=746)   edge of neuroscience. Anyway, who knows what, but if there were a way to knock out the necessary 
<br>[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=753)   cause for the necessary cause, and it was purely physiological, then nirvana would actually 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=759)   simply happen. Now, what I find the delicious notion is that you can get funding for craving 
<br>[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=770)   research, and you can get funding for deep and broad craving research, and you can get 
<br>[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=775)   funding from Republicans, gladly, for deep and broad craving research. Therefore, it 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=783)   could come to pass that Republicans become responsible for the entire world of becoming 
<br>[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=793)   Buddhist. 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ElQ9y5qQ0&t=794)   There we go. That was good. That was good. 
<br>
