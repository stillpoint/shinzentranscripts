<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=0)   You did some unusual things in the course of these YouTube interviews, and you did some 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=12)   things that, there's a blooper reel, you haven't, in fact you showed it to me. There are many 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=19)   teachers who might not want to present themselves in certain lights as you have a view wearing 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=29)   the garb of a terrorist or having bodily functions of certain kinds. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=36)   Strictly speaking, that was merely the national dress of Palestine. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=42)   Oh, okay. I'm sorry, you were playing it. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=45)   Well, I did have a little bit of an intense look, and that was intentional. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=50)   Do you regret it? 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=52)   No, not at all. I also point out that I appeared with an Israeli army amiga. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=57)   Well, that was going to be my next thing, and you looked pretty intense there, too. 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=61)   I was scary on either side. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=64)   So, you don't regret doing any of these funny, silly things? Most teachers might not want to appear in a less than... 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=76)   Dignified? 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=77)   Yes, I guess that's the word. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=79)   You mean like, have the whole world be able to actually listen to me fart, for example? 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=84)   I said bodily function. I wasn't going to go, yes, he did that. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=89)   Well, I have no reason so far to regret it. We'll see what happens. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=96)   Well, now, do you feel, is there an advantage or a disadvantage to showing your, I guess you could say, playful humanity? 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ_A4eZTgPY&t=107)   Well, there's a huge advantage. I think in the end, people want to know that there's a human being behind the sermon, so to speak.
