title: "How we Evolve & Integrate (including the 'Dark Night') ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=0)   So, yesterday I told the story of when I was at Mampuku-ji and a friend introduced me to 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=26)   the poet Gary Snyder and we became buddies. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=31)   And then later in a presentation here in the United States at a university, someone asked 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=37)   him who can save the world. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=40)   And he gave a typical Zen answer. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=46)   He said, well, I can't tell you who that person is, but I can tell you something about that 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=52)   person. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=53)   It's going to be someone who doesn't need to save the world. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=60)   And he sort of left it at that. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=62)   So what did he mean by that? 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=71)   Someone who doesn't need to save the world. 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=76)   Let me see if I can fill in some of the details because it's actually a very deep issue. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=91)   This path, contemplative-based psycho-spiritual growth, is how I think of this path. 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=101)   It's universal. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=103)   You find it all over the planet, east-west, prehistoric, historic times. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=113)   There's an underlying commonality, which if you think about it is utterly extraordinary 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=121)   considering the enormous variation in culture, language, race, and so forth, that is this 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=132)   planet, east-west, ancient-modern, prehistoric actually when I say ancient, Stone Age, our 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=142)   remote ancestors. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=147)   So there is this very human thing, this universal human thing that I call contemplative-based 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=159)   psycho-spiritual growth. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=165)   It represents a radical re-engineering of our humanity. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=173)   So I mean I like to present things as you know sort of in a light, humorous way. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=180)   And the reason is because this is actually such a heavy-duty industrial strength process 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=190)   so it's nice to be light and humorous about it and not take ourselves too seriously. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=196)   But actually it is very heavy-duty. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=206)   My phrase is it represents a fundamental re-engineering of who we are. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=217)   And I'm going to guess that it's the next step in evolution, although obviously no one 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=224)   can know that. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=226)   But if you look at how evolution has proceeded hitherto, it's through natural selection 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=235)   at a biological level. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=239)   And we are the beneficiaries of that process. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=246)   Eventually that process, it took millions and millions of years, but that process produced 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=254)   an amazingly intelligent species on this planet, at least relative to the intelligence of the 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=263)   previous species. 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=265)   Now yes, there's other quite intelligent species, elephants, porpoises, other great apes and 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=275)   so forth. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=276)   But when you look at our brains, there's just an amazing difference at a physical level. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=287)   So we're smart, and I think that we're smart enough to figure out that there's a couple 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=300)   little flaws in our engineering. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=306)   The other species have to just wait for the Darwinian timescale, which is mega years, 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=315)   millions of years for natural selection, or certainly tens of thousands of years for natural 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=321)   selection to mould through expansion and contraction, life and death, mould their evolution. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=332)   But apparently, and once again this is conjectural on my part, but apparently natural selection 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=341)   has finally produced a species smart enough to actually realise that there are flaws. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=354)   The entire European tradition, at least post-pagan Europe, the Christian tradition, is based 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=367)   on that paradigm, and whether or not one accepts the story, the Greek word for story being 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=376)   mythos, whether or not you accept the myth or the story, you cannot argue with the logic 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=388)   that there's something wrong. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=393)   Look out at the world, something's not quite right. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=397)   Now you can say, and we will say, that there is a primordial okayness also, but on the 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=413)   surface there's some problems, which sort of makes sense when you think about it, because 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=420)   very complex creatures like us can develop problems. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=425)   Our own strengths become our weaknesses. 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=431)   We have this incredibly advanced immune system to defend us, but then what happens? 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=443)   It commonly creates an inflammatory response that kills us. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=453)   Infection is our defences, sort of overworking, overreacting. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=461)   Septic shock can do you in. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=465)   So there's something a little off in the engineering. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=471)   We are real smart, so we have real big heads, which is sort of nice, but unfortunately they're 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=480)   now too big to come out of the mother conveniently, so the birthing process is very, very difficult 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=489)   for our species. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=491)   It's an engineering flaw. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=494)   Well we sort of took care of that with modern obstetrics and so forth. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=504)   We benefit from bipedalism, we could walk upright, but we get a lot of lower back problems. 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=513)   So it's great, but Darwin is not perfect. 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=523)   We have this intelligence, but unfortunately moment by moment, before the rational brain 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=535)   gets activated, another part of the brain called the limbic system, the amygdala, the 
<br>[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=544)   nucleus accumbens, and other emotional structures, they get activated first. 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=556)   So that our rationality is neuroanatomically coloured by emotionality. 
<br>[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=573)   So we have the situation of having this advanced primate brain, and in the centre of it is 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=584)   essentially the world view of a Komodo dragon. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=591)   If you've ever seen any videos about Komodo dragons, their society is not a kind one. 
<br>[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=605)   So there's some possible problem here. 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=613)   In the neuroscience field there have been numerous imaging studies, watching people's 
<br>[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=622)   brains react to politicians. 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=629)   And it absolutely does not matter what your politics are. 
<br>[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=635)   When you listen to the other, your emotional brain lights up and your rational brain just 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=644)   shuts down. 
<br>[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=645)   It's expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=649)   So not surprising, huh, what happens, given that that's sort of how we're engineered. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=659)   So good news is we're smart enough to figure this all out. 
<br>[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=666)   I just said it. 
<br>[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=668)   We're smart enough to figure it out, and we're smart enough to correct it. 
<br>[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=677)   And the way that that has been done hitherto is certainly a lot faster than Darwin, but 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=688)   maybe not as fast as we would like, because you probably noticed it takes years and decades 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=694)   typically. 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=695)   Although we get benefits right away, otherwise people would never come back after the first 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=700)   retreat. 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=701)   We do get benefits right away. 
<br>[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=703)   But those of you that have hung in for the duration know that in general God saves the 
<br>[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=714)   best for last. 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=718)   Usually really mind-boggling dramatic changes tend to happen after a lifetime of practice. 
<br>[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=730)   What? 
<br>[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=731)   Well, happiness independent of conditions, which is pretty awesome. 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=738)   So that's still pretty quick. 
<br>[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=743)   So it's a radical reengineering, and who knows what the next few centuries will bring. 
<br>[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=752)   Maybe as we partner with science, we'll be able to accelerate things by an order of magnitude. 
<br>[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=761)   I've got a friend at Google. 
<br>[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=763)   Some of you probably have read his books, Jet Meng Tan, known as Meng to his friends. 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=777)   That's the weird Chow Chow dialect of Chinese. 
<br>[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=779)   He's Singaporean Chinese. 
<br>[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=781)   I call him Chan. 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=783)   His last name is Chan in Mandarin, Chan-ee-ming. 
<br>[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=788)   It's a really cool name, actually. 
<br>[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=790)   It comes out Jet Meng in his dialect, but Ee-ming in Mandarin. 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=796)   It means like one voice, one voice that shakes the world. 
<br>[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=807)   It's from Buddhism. 
<br>[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=808)   It's a Buddhist term. 
<br>[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=810)   Anyway, because he's a Google engineer, he started this Search Inside Yourself thing, 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=815)   some of you are probably aware of. 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=817)   His thing is 10x, stream entry 10x. 
<br>[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=823)   Stream entry is the traditional Theravada term for initial enlightenment. 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=830)   And 10x means he wants to engineer it so it's 10 times quicker for all humans, and we have 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=839)   10 times as many of them. 
<br>[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=841)   Now maybe we'll have a thousand or a million times as many of them, who knows. 
<br>[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=847)   Can't say about the future. 
<br>[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=850)   But it is a radical re-engineering of who we are. 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=864)   So who are we? 
<br>[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=865)   Well, from an engineer's point of view, we're an input-output system. 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=873)   We have sensory input, we have behavioral output. 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=878)   The sensory input reflects objective conditions. 
<br>[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=884)   The behavioral output impacts objective conditions. 
<br>[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=892)   And in between we have inner and outer sensory experience. 
<br>[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=897)   I like to classify it in terms of inner and outer seaheer feel with the inner seaheer 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=903)   feel creating the core sense of, or associated with the core sense of I am-ness. 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=911)   So part of the re-engineering, the radical re-engineering I talked about yesterday. 
<br>[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=926)   On the sensory side, the ability to have complete experience allows us to experience discomfort 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=942)   with less and less suffering, and it allows us to experience pleasure with more and more 
<br>[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=950)   fulfillment. 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=955)   So that has an impact on our behavior. 
<br>[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=979)   Sensorially behavior is driven by suffering and frustration. 
<br>[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=992)   So suffering is physical and or emotional pain that is not experienced fully. 
<br>[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1004)   So sensorially that causes suffering, and in terms of what we do say and think in the 
<br>[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1012)   world, our behavior, it causes a driven-ness in the behavior. 
<br>[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1021)   On the flip side, when pleasure fails to deliver the full potential for fulfillment, it turns 
<br>[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1034)   into what might be described as frustration or craving. 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1041)   Same thing. 
<br>[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1043)   The experience of a craving in the moment is just an experience of an incomplete pleasure. 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1051)   You may have heard the notion that the impurities are pure. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1057)   What the hell does that mean? 
<br>[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1059)   Well, it actually means something very, very deep and important. 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1064)   It's not just an enigmatic thing that someone said in order to blow your mind or get your 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1069)   attention. 
<br>[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1072)   When you have a craving for some pleasure, you could have a mental image of the pleasure, 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1080)   you could have some mental talk that says, hey, I want this, but you actually get a little 
<br>[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1086)   taste, a memory of the physical pleasure and more importantly, emotional pleasures, a rosiness 
<br>[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1095)   in the chest, a little hint of smile on the face, a frisson of excitement going up your 
<br>[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1101)   back. 
<br>[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1102)   Very, very subtle pleasure is present in that moment of, in the sensory experience of desire. 
<br>[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1114)   If you are able to complete that pleasure, then it won't, that pleasure, the pleasure 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1122)   that is part of the sensory gestalt of the moment of desire, then that pleasure will 
<br>[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1129)   give you complete fulfillment, the pleasure in the desire will fulfill the desire. 
<br>[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1136)   If that doesn't happen, then the desire becomes a desire that drives sensory experience because 
<br>[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1143)   you're not satisfied yet. 
<br>[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1146)   That was pretty subtle and complex, but driven behavior, need, is associated with physical 
<br>[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1162)   and or emotional discomfort that has turned into suffering and or physical and or emotional 
<br>[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1169)   pleasure that was too subtle to complete, was so subtle that you couldn't experience 
<br>[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1177)   it fully enough to fulfill you right then and there. 
<br>[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1181)   And now we're driven. 
<br>[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1185)   So there is need. 
<br>[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1192)   Half of the radical reengineering of this process is sensorially the reduction of suffering 
<br>[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1206)   and the elevation of fulfillment. 
<br>[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1209)   But that is linked behaviorally to the reengineering of driven behavior into what, for lack of 
<br>[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1222)   any official word, I might call motivated or dynamic behavior. 
<br>[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1235)   I think it's very important that the result of our practice not make us indifferent to 
<br>[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1246)   conditions, conditions in our own individual life, community, nation, world. 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1258)   So in order for that to happen, we actually have to take measures to make sure that not 
<br>[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1266)   only is our experience one of reduced suffering and elevated fulfillment, that our behavior 
<br>[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1278)   moves, is reengineered, evolves from driven to dynamic. 
<br>[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1293)   So what characterizes dynamic behavior is it is motivated by 
<br>[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1308)   pain and fulfillment. 
<br>[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1312)   It is not driven by suffering and frustration. 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1335)   As we evolve, we go from the somethingness of self and world to a kind of doingness of 
<br>[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1356)   space. 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1360)   However that requires acclimatization. 
<br>[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1373)   Some people, as they get their emptiness or no self or nothingness, whatever you want 
<br>[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1384)   to call it, as that becomes evident, some people, actually many people, probably most 
<br>[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1395)   people immediately love it. 
<br>[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1402)   And it is functional in most cases. 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1407)   One of my teachers used to say a couple drops of emptiness are the best medicine in the 
<br>[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1417)   world. 
<br>[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1418)   It cures a gazillion diseases. 
<br>[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1422)   However, it is not necessarily the case that for everyone, contacting emptiness or no self 
<br>[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1435)   or nothingness is immediately a source of safety, fulfillment, love, and appropriate 
<br>[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1448)   behavior. 
<br>[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1451)   For some people, you have to sort of cultivate a taste for it. 
<br>[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1460)   There's some work required to integrate it so that it is a source of fulfillment, safety, 
<br>[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1479)   love and appropriate behavior. 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1486)   For some people, they have to go through an awkward intermediate zone where they sort 
<br>[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1500)   of are in a flatline situation. 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1505)   Where in some way it's sort of nice because the old gross suffering and horrific perennial 
<br>[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1517)   agitation is gone. 
<br>[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1520)   But the old bounce is also gone. 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1524)   And the edge and the motivation and the passion for life seems to have left. 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1534)   I call that the flatline stage. 
<br>[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1538)   So some people have no difficulty at all integrating emptiness. 
<br>[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1547)   It's just so obvious how it's liberating and functional. 
<br>[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1555)   Some people have to sort of intentionally train themselves to develop the palate, the 
<br>[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1561)   taste for it, to appreciate that it is liberating and functional. 
<br>[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1568)   Some people have more of a challenge. 
<br>[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1572)   You go through this flatline situation. 
<br>[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1577)   Now most people don't have much of a difficulty or they require some training, but it's not 
<br>[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1589)   a big deal. 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1595)   Less people have the flatline, but it does happen. 
<br>[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1599)   I get emails from students all the time that are in that state. 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1607)   Fortunately the severe end of that spectrum, so you see I'm presenting to you a spectrum 
<br>[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1616)   of relationships to the emptiness. 
<br>[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1624)   No, a better phrase would be a spectrum of degree of challenge to integrate emptiness 
<br>[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1635)   so that it is liberating and motivating. 
<br>[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1643)   So there's the real easy end, and that's a lot of people. 
<br>[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1649)   Then there's, well, take some work, and then there's like take some more work because you're 
<br>[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1655)   in that flatline thing. 
<br>[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1658)   Then there's the deep doo-doo end. 
<br>[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1663)   Now fortunately that is, in my experience, quite rare. 
<br>[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1670)   But as more and more people practice, even though it's a relatively small percentage, 
<br>[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1680)   you're going to have larger numbers of people have to face that. 
<br>[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1685)   That's going to be part of the shadow side of contemplative-based psychospiritual growth 
<br>[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1694)   becoming the norm on this planet. 
<br>[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1697)   It'll be a wonderful thing that that happens, but hey, we have to be honest. 
<br>[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1702)   We have to address this issue. 
<br>[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1707)   Fortunately all of these sort of steps, the spectrum that I'm describing, there are effective 
<br>[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1717)   things you can do to deal with it, even the really deep end. 
<br>[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1722)   So the deep end I call dark night, some other people also call it the dark night. 
<br>[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1731)   It's similar to a known psychiatric condition called DPDR, depersonalization, derealization 
<br>[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1742)   disorder, which happens to non-meditators. 
<br>[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1747)   It just happens to people out of nowhere. 
<br>[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1752)   The classic report of DPDR is I was sitting in my room and suddenly it seemed like I was 
<br>[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1762)   no longer real and the world was flat and cartoonish and had no reality to it whatsoever. 
<br>[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1775)   No matter what I do, I can't get out of this and it's awful. 
<br>[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1784)   So the disease names the condition depersonalization, they've had insight into no self. 
<br>[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1795)   Derealization, the world is no longer real, disorder and it's a bad trip. 
<br>[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1807)   If you go to websites of people that have this condition, some of them know that no 
<br>[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1815)   self and emptiness are major Buddhist themes. 
<br>[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1820)   There's one website where they say, I just don't get it, how can the Buddhists say this 
<br>[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1828)   is the best thing that ever happened when this is the worst thing that ever happened? 
<br>[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1838)   Yet the great majority of people that do Buddhist practice do indeed find it to be the best 
<br>[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1848)   thing that ever happened. 
<br>[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1850)   So what's the difference? 
<br>[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1854)   Well I don't know exactly what's the difference. 
<br>[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1861)   Someday we'll probably know. 
<br>[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1864)   But what I can say is several things. 
<br>[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1870)   First of all, you've probably noticed that the word mindfulness is now used a lot. 
<br>[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1878)   It's like everywhere, which is a good thing. 
<br>[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1882)   But now that it's everywhere, it sort of can mean anything. 
<br>[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1892)   And so the meaning of mindfulness gets watered down and sort of generalized as it becomes 
<br>[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1901)   a common term. 
<br>[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1904)   That's why I'm so adamant to say that what I mean by mindfulness is exactly this. 
<br>[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1916)   Well people picked up on the term dark night. 
<br>[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1921)   Now it's gaining currency and it's getting watered down. 
<br>[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1929)   And now it sort of means just any difficulty that you might encounter when you meditate. 
<br>[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1936)   People are starting to call that the dark night. 
<br>[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1938)   Well I prefer to have mindfulness be a technical term, not a general, hey be aware folks. 
<br>[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1948)   But I would prefer the dark night to mean what it meant for St. John of the Cross, which 
<br>[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1953)   is in the Catholic tradition, which is where this comes from. 
<br>[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1958)   Which is when they finally, when you were born into 16th century Spanish Catholicism. 
<br>[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1967)   And you definitely had some ideas about what God was going to be like. 
<br>[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1973)   And it turns out that it's not quite that way. 
<br>[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1981)   And it takes some getting used to the fact that nothing whatsoeverness is in fact divine. 
<br>[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=1997)   So that difficulty integrating the emptiness of God, what St. John called it the dark night 
<br>[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2009)   of the soul. 
<br>[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2011)   You start out and you have to struggle with your sinfulness, your selfishness, your impurities, 
<br>[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2020)   your lack of concentration. 
<br>[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2024)   You struggle with that. 
<br>[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2025)   He called that the dark night of the senses. 
<br>[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2028)   That's the beginning of the meditative path. 
<br>[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2031)   But then if you're really successful, you have to deal with the consequences of that. 
<br>[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2040)   So he called that the dark night of the soul. 
<br>[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2044)   So he had a lot of difficulty integrating the nothingness of God. 
<br>[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2051)   But eventually he did. 
<br>[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2052)   He was successful. 
<br>[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2057)   So that, as I'd like the dark night to refer to that specific problem. 
<br>[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2071)   Rather than just be another word for, hey folks, you know if you meditate you might 
<br>[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2075)   have to face some gnarly shit. 
<br>[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2078)   And you're going to go through your dark night. 
<br>[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2082)   Well everyone goes through some gnarly shit, okay. 
<br>[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2085)   Just living you go through some gnarly shit. 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2087)   Doesn't mean you're experiencing depersonalization, derealization that you can't get out of and 
<br>[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2093)   it's a bad trip. 
<br>[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2097)   That's a very, very different critter. 
<br>[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2101)   Now as I say, in my experience it's relatively rare. 
<br>[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2107)   So don't think, oh my God I better not meditate because I'm sure that's going to happen to 
<br>[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2114)   me. 
<br>[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2115)   So there's a spectrum of challenge associated with integrating the emptiness. 
<br>[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2134)   And integrating it means two things, that it's sensorially it accrues to an empowerment 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2144)   and behaviorally it does not lead to an indifference. 
<br>[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2158)   So how do we make sure that this radical reengineering is successful? 
<br>[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2171)   Well I've got a lot of talks about this. 
<br>[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2176)   But just to give you the executive summary, we're going from one kind of passionate life 
<br>[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2196)   to another. 
<br>[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2200)   The former kind of passionate life was driven by passions in the sense of craving, aversion, 
<br>[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2210)   unconsciousness and so forth. 
<br>[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2213)   The new passionate life arises in a different way. 
<br>[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2222)   And if that happens automatically, fine. 
<br>[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2225)   If it doesn't happen automatically, then that becomes part of the training to make sure 
<br>[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2230)   that it does happen. 
<br>[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2232)   So let's say that some training is required. 
<br>[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2240)   So essentially from my perspective you do the same thing for any place on that spectrum. 
<br>[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2254)   The person that needs to do a little bit of effort to integrate the void, the person that 
<br>[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2261)   is flatlining and needs more effort considerably, and then the rare case of the person who is 
<br>[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2270)   essentially paralyzed by the void. 
<br>[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2276)   What differs is not so much the qualitative part of the intervention, what differs is 
<br>[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2285)   the quantitative part. 
<br>[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2288)   The more difficulty integrating, the more massive the intervention that is required. 
<br>[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2299)   So it's a matter of amount. 
<br>[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2302)   But in terms of what you actually do, it's pretty much the same thing. 
<br>[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2309)   So the common problematic situation is not DPDR, it's the flatline. 
<br>[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2321)   So it's like, how do I get the old bounce back? 
<br>[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2329)   So let me give a bunch of tangible suggestions. 
<br>[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2346)   This is something you can know about for your own practice, but it's also something to know 
<br>[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2351)   about in teaching others. 
<br>[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2356)   Because again as mindfulness becomes more prevalent and part of mainstream culture worldwide, 
<br>[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2366)   it will be important to be clear about these things. 
<br>[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2372)   So let's say that you've gotten some taste of emptiness, but there's some challenge in 
<br>[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2380)   making it integrated. 
<br>[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2383)   So first one thing you can do is selectively attend to what is pleasant in the emptiness. 
<br>[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2397)   Now you might say, well the emptiness doesn't have any pleasure. 
<br>[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2400)   Well that's technically true, but it can cause pleasant impact on a human. 
<br>[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2408)   So what could be things that you would train someone to tune into if they were in a flatline 
<br>[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2415)   situation? 
<br>[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2416)   Well, I'd have them look for certain things. 
<br>[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2420)   For one thing, the emptiness may carry a tranquility with it. 
<br>[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2429)   And you can train yourself to appreciate that tranquility. 
<br>[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2439)   And it may actually take an intentional training to sort of tune in, oh yeah, it's sort of 
<br>[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2445)   nice that I can touch this tranquility on demand. 
<br>[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2453)   So that's a training, it's a development of a palate, a taste for the void. 
<br>[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2460)   What else? 
<br>[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2461)   Now, of course, the tranquility might not be something they're aware of. 
<br>[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2465)   This is an algorithm, it's an interactive process that I do. 
<br>[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2475)   So one thing I ask is, okay, can you sort of enjoy a tranquility associated with the 
<br>[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2483)   void? 
<br>[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2484)   I use emptiness, void, no self. 
<br>[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2487)   They all mean the same thing. 
<br>[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2489)   Some people might quibble that they're different terms, but it's essentially the same continuum 
<br>[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2496)   at the same critter. 
<br>[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2498)   Okay, what else? 
<br>[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2501)   Well, the emptiness might be associated with the disappearance of a boundary between inside 
<br>[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2508)   and outside. 
<br>[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2512)   And that can be fulfilling and give you a sense of expanded identity and connectedness. 
<br>[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2527)   So I check for that, and if that's available, okay, now we're going to selectively attend 
<br>[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2532)   to that. 
<br>[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2534)   Instead of attending to worrying about the bleakness of the void, let's look at these 
<br>[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2541)   factors. 
<br>[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2542)   What else? 
<br>[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2543)   Well, it's possible that the emptiness is associated with subtle vibratory energy that 
<br>[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2558)   could be perceived as pleasant. 
<br>[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2563)   So you tune into that if that's available. 
<br>[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2570)   Okay, well, what else? 
<br>[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2579)   Well there might be a sense of sort of effortless expansion with a simultaneous contraction. 
<br>[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2596)   If so, you could tune into that, that may or may not be present. 
<br>[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2601)   So what else can we do? 
<br>[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2604)   All of the things I just mentioned I call accentuating the positive. 
<br>[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2612)   Then there's eliminating the negative. 
<br>[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2618)   If the emptiness causes fear or irritability or any other sort of confusion, if there's 
<br>[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2634)   any or a disinclination to act, those are sensory events. 
<br>[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2647)   So everything is empty, so why should I bother doing anything at all? 
<br>[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2655)   Why should I bother doing anything at all? 
<br>[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2662)   Is a thought now, isn't it? 
<br>[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2665)   It's an arising in the inner system. 
<br>[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2670)   Probably it is not the case that everything is empty for this individual because the perception 
<br>[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2679)   everything is empty so why do anything ain't empty. 
<br>[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2686)   It's a something for that person. 
<br>[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2690)   Before the perception, I thought that the emptiness was going to be nicer than this. 
<br>[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2700)   I think that's what John of the Cross' problem was. 
<br>[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2705)   He was expecting the angels and the triumphalist whatever and instead he got nada, nada, nada. 
<br>[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2717)   He had molte nada. 
<br>[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2727)   Or as my people say, bubkus. 
<br>[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2730)   So it's like I thought it was going to be better than this. 
<br>[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2740)   No, that's not a thought. 
<br>[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2742)   That's not empty. 
<br>[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2744)   So you empty out the reactions to the emptiness. 
<br>[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2748)   Then there's nothing to get in the way of responding appropriately to objective circumstances. 
<br>[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2763)   But now the response is not driven. 
<br>[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2766)   It just happens and it's powerful and it's magic. 
<br>[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2777)   And it's progressively more appropriate. 
<br>[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2785)   Just because you're functioning from emptiness doesn't mean that what you do is always appropriate. 
<br>[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2793)   You'll still make mistakes or it makes mistakes. 
<br>[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2799)   But then it learns from those mistakes just like the self-self learned from its mistake. 
<br>[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2804)   The baby doesn't just get up and walk. 
<br>[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2807)   It falls to the right, it falls to the left. 
<br>[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2811)   But at some point it equilibrates. 
<br>[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2814)   When the no-self doesn't perfectly speak in public or respond to each situation perfectly, 
<br>[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2827)   it makes mistakes. 
<br>[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2829)   It's inappropriate. 
<br>[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2831)   But then it learns just like the self-self learned. 
<br>[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2835)   And if it doesn't, then you become something not very pretty. 
<br>[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2840)   So don't let that happen. 
<br>[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2842)   If it doesn't learn from its mistake, if you think anything you do that just happens and 
<br>[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2850)   there's no ego behind it and so it's okay no matter what it is, even if you're mistreating 
<br>[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2857)   people, no, don't think it works that way. 
<br>[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2863)   Some people think it works that way, but I strongly disagree with that philosophy of 
<br>[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2869)   practice. 
<br>[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2876)   So you now are more and more arising from the situation. 
<br>[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2886)   So your objective behavior comes out of objective reality. 
<br>[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2893)   And if it's not right, it learns. 
<br>[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2897)   You learn, whatever remnant of self is there learns. 
<br>[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2901)   The no-self learns to do it right. 
<br>[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2906)   To the extent that that happens, now you start to become a magic person that just walks into 
<br>[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2914)   a situation and magic things happen and it's wonderful for everyone. 
<br>[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2922)   What else? 
<br>[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2923)   Well, more might be required, particularly with respect to making sure that the actions 
<br>[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2933)   are appropriate from a human point of view. 
<br>[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2940)   You may need to intentionally build certain human habits and how you build those positive 
<br>[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2953)   human habits? 
<br>[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2955)   Easy, nurture positive. 
<br>[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2959)   You create an activity called an admirable self by training admirable human traits, rational 
<br>[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2972)   thought, positive behavior changes of various sorts, habitual good feelings towards people 
<br>[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2984)   and so forth. 
<br>[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2986)   Well, you can build those by the nurture positive techniques. 
<br>[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=2993)   So you can use things like focus in to deconstruct the resistance to act or the freak out that 
<br>[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3003)   is a reaction to the void. 
<br>[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3007)   So you empty out the reactions to the emptiness, you empty out the disinclinations to act and 
<br>[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3015)   focus in deconstructing the inner see, hear, feel is a good technique for that. 
<br>[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3022)   And then you reconstruct or strengthen certain positive habits through nurture positive. 
<br>[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3031)   What else? 
<br>[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3035)   Well, if the old behavior was passionate in the sense that it was driven by passions, 
<br>[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3051)   what's going to provide the bounce for the new behavior? 
<br>[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3055)   Well, the situation, all the things I just mentioned plus something else. 
<br>[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3063)   You can train your motor circuits in to a quality of spontaneity. 
<br>[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3074)   We've talked about this and done this now in a number of retreats and we're going to 
<br>[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3079)   be doing it at the end of this retreat if you look at the schedule. 
<br>[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3082)   The auto, the training not of the sense circuits but of the motor circuits to enjoy their own 
<br>[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3099)   natural just happeningness. 
<br>[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3104)   So you can develop a taste for what children experience directly but don't think of as 
<br>[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3115)   an object because it just happens to them. 
<br>[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3119)   But children just like stomp in the mud because it's just fun to stomp in the mud. 
<br>[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3127)   It just happens. 
<br>[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3130)   There's a just happeningness to the way a child stomps in the mud or runs here or runs 
<br>[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3135)   there. 
<br>[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3136)   Well, an adult, even if they're an alta cocker like me, an old foggy crapper like me, can 
<br>[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3147)   still have that childlike bounce because the circuits are still there. 
<br>[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3154)   It's the nature of our motor circuits to just happen. 
<br>[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3159)   So you can train yourself to speak, move and even think from the place of bounce. 
<br>[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3173)   That's what literally puts the bounce back in your step and puts the lilt back in your 
<br>[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3180)   speech. 
<br>[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3183)   That's a huge factor in making sure that the realization of emptiness does not make you 
<br>[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3194)   inexpressive or indifferent with regards to the world. 
<br>[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3208)   What else? 
<br>[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3211)   Well, some people, and this can happen as the result of contacting the emptiness, but 
<br>[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3222)   it can actually happen. 
<br>[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3225)   It can be something that you contact the first time you ever meditate. 
<br>[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3235)   In fact, for some people, the thing I'm about to describe is something they've known about 
<br>[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3240)   their whole life. 
<br>[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3244)   Not everyone, but some people have this sense that inside of them is a primordial black 
<br>[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3256)   hole of dissatisfaction that can never be filled. 
<br>[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3271)   Now I'm stating it one way, people use different language, but there's just this void in me 
<br>[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3282)   that no matter what I try, it's just never filled. 
<br>[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3289)   And it cannot be filled. 
<br>[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3294)   Despite that, I keep flailing around and flailing around hoping to find something that will 
<br>[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3301)   fill it. 
<br>[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3303)   So not everyone, not all humans have this perception, but I have found this to be a 
<br>[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3308)   not uncommon perception, something along these lines. 
<br>[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3314)   The trick here is to realize that yes, indeed, nothing will ever fill that hole. 
<br>[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3322)   However, from another perspective, there is absolutely a way to fill that hole. 
<br>[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3333)   And the way to fill that hole is not to try to do something to fill the hole, but not 
<br>[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3341)   surprisingly, the trick is to have a complete experience of that hole. 
<br>[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3352)   Because that perception that there is this hole inside of me that can never be fulfilled 
<br>[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3358)   is a sensory event. 
<br>[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3363)   It happens in the inner system, it comes up in life, it may be lurking all the time in 
<br>[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3369)   the periphery or sometimes come up strongly. 
<br>[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3372)   Now as I say, not all human beings have this by any means, but quite a few do. 
<br>[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3378)   The trick is to realize it is an inner sensory event. 
<br>[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3385)   It comes up in some combination, albeit perhaps subtly and nebulously, but it's coming up 
<br>[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3391)   in the inner system. 
<br>[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3393)   Now when something comes up in the inner system, sometimes you can't quite pin it down in terms 
<br>[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3399)   of image, talk and body motion, but at least you know it is in the inner system. 
<br>[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3405)   And that gives you a general direction to pour clarity and equanimity constantly down 
<br>[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3415)   into that hole. 
<br>[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3418)   And guess what? 
<br>[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3420)   Just like every other sensory event, it eventually evaporates and problem solved. 
<br>[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3432)   Now you've filled it, you've filled it by annihilating it. 
<br>[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3443)   So once again, the fundamental drivenness has been worked through. 
<br>[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3450)   So when Gary said the kind of person who can save the world is the person who doesn't need 
<br>[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3458)   to save the world. 
<br>[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3463)   What he was implying is a human being who has been re-engineered in a radical way. 
<br>[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3479)   Because he was giving the Zen poetry answer, he didn't fill in the details. 
<br>[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqA74RpHzzo&t=3493)   So notice that the details took a full hour to describe.
