title: "Shinzen Young's 'CHART of HUMAN HAPPINESS'"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=0)   Okay, so the human condition, humanity in general, each one of us in specific, can be 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=26)   iconically represented this way. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=32)   There's a lot of information stored in this. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=36)   As far as I can see, everything that's significant for an individual or for us collectively is 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=45)   iconically represented here. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=49)   So what you do is you draw a circle and then you draw two intersecting triangles, and you 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=55)   draw a couple more circles and a dot, and then we're going to make this into a life 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=60)   saver, spiritual life saver. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=66)   And six compartments. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=69)   And you draw an I, U-I-E, C, here, here, feel, the three sense modalities. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=83)   There's inner activation for each one of these. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=88)   See in, see in right here, that's your mental images. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=93)   Hear in, this is your mental talk. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=96)   Feel in, this is your emotional body. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=100)   But there's also the physical senses, see out, the physical world here. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=106)   Hear out, hear the sounds of the world, feel out the physical impact of your body. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=113)   So you have the inner and outer visual, somatic, and auditory arisings. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=117)   These are our ordinary sensory experiences that create the sense of self on the inside 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=124)   and physical world on the outside. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=127)   And then from the viewpoint of psychospiritual growth, there are certain special states that 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=135)   are significant. 
<br>[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=136)   Physical states, and there's visual, auditory, and somatic rest. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=143)   Flow states, visual, auditory, somatic flow. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=146)   And within the subjective activation, there's a particular proper subset of positive images, 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=156)   positive mental talk, and pleasant positive emotions. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=161)   The subset of our inner activation that relates to our human goodness is very important. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=166)   So that's positive. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=170)   So see, hear, feel, in, out, rest, flow. 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=177)   Good. 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=180)   To go. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=185)   To are the two sides of the spiritual source. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=188)   And go, or gone, is what happens when those two sides come together and you have to get 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=198)   a complete source. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=199)   But when there's complete source, there's no self or world. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=204)   So the source breaks apart, and in the cleft is born the self and world, at least as we 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=209)   experience it sensorially here. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=214)   Jewish mysticism has a whole thing about tzitzum, how chesed and tvura, the allowing half of 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=224)   God and the limiting half of God, pull apart and create this cleft, wherein the world arises. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=233)   Very, very interesting paradigm, and something we can actually experience. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=239)   So this is the world of sensory experience. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=246)   Beyond the images, the mental talk, and the emotional body, beneath it is our subconscious 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=254)   mind, which is, as far as I can tell, a vast world of connectivity. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=269)   Now in the objective world, we have behaviors, indicated by little feet, how we walk. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=281)   And they basically come in three flavors, good behavior, bad behavior, and ethically 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=287)   neutral behavior. 
<br>[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=289)   This tends to be linked with three objective situations in the world, desirable situations, 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=298)   undesirable situations, and sort of neutral situations. 
<br>[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=301)   So this is the law of karma. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=304)   I don't know that it's an exact accountancy across lifetimes, but certainly there are 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=311)   general tendencies. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=312)   What goes around comes around. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=314)   And I think it's important to be aware that actions have consequences. 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=329)   Beyond our personal world of our personal behaviors and our personal situations is the 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=334)   real world, whatever that is. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=337)   Not sure. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=338)   I can give you a conjecture what the real world is. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=343)   I'm sorry. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=345)   Do it. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=346)   I will. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=347)   But it's just my conjecture. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=350)   This I know for sure. 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=351)   I have absolute confidence that this works the way it works. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=356)   But this is the world of sensory experience. 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=359)   The real world, in my conjecture, is sort of like the subconscious. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=365)   It's a vast realm of connectivity. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=369)   And you can certainly, in your meditation practice, get the sense that when this collapses, 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=376)   the inner world of connectivity and the outer world of connectivity merge. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=385)   That's a whole other paradigm for enlightenment. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=388)   Ichinen sanzen. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=390)   Can you see it, Philip? 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=396)   Oops. 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=400)   Ichinen sanzen. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=404)   One mind moment contains 3,000 worlds. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=412)   Actually, 3,000 world systems. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=418)   OK. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=419)   So that's the tientai in China. 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=423)   A whole other paradigm for enlightenment, completely unknown in the West. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=427)   Died out in China, too, 1,000 years ago. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=430)   But someone had an enlightenment based on the experience of this merging with this. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=436)   And another guy, also, the Huayan school, very similar notion. 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=443)   Huayan has influenced the modern Vietnamese master Thich Nhat Hanh. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=449)   When he talks about inner being, that's directly from the Huayan tradition. 
<br>[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=456)   And that's based on an appreciation of the similarity between these two things. 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=462)   But anyway, that's a whole other deal. 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=466)   I like to work here. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=470)   When you want to help someone, this is also useful to keep in mind. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=478)   How do you help someone? 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=480)   Well, you want to get a sense of their whole situation. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=484)   Now, you may not be able to do something about a lot of their situation. 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=488)   But it's useful, I think, to have a sense of the whole situation. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=492)   So when I am in a position to help someone, I figure out what their sensory challenges are. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=501)   Like maybe they have pain. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=504)   OK. 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=505)   But I know if they have physical pain as an issue, then I know that they probably have image talk and emotional reactions to that. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=515)   So they've got a sort of sensory challenge. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=518)   But I also think about, well, are there behavior changes they need to make? 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=523)   Is there something that they need to change about their objective situation, if possible? 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=529)   Et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=530)   So I use this as a sort of matrix to remind me how to organize a plan, a plan to help that person improve their life. 
<br>[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=546)   So I think of the sensory challenges. 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=549)   I think of the behavioral challenges. 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=551)   I think of the situational challenges. 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=554)   And then I think of the various mindfulness approaches, the focus options that can work with those. 
<br>[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=563)   And so that gives me a framework for suggesting a treatment plan, so to speak. 
<br>[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=577)   So let's look at what that treatment plan is in the most general framework. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=591)   In the most general framework, we could say that the goal of mindfulness practice is total human happiness. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=604)   I have an icon for that, a square smiley face. 
<br>[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=611)   So in order to understand total human happiness, we have to understand surface happiness, and we have to understand what I call deep happiness. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=630)   Now, total human happiness consists of surface happiness for yourself, deep happiness for yourself, 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=638)   helping others to achieve surface happiness, and helping others to achieve deep happiness. 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=644)   If you're doing all four of those, then, or in some way fostering all four of those, 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=652)   then I say you are experiencing total or complete human happiness. 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=658)   Now, what most people call happiness is what I would call surface happiness for themselves. 
<br>[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=667)   If you ask most people, you know, what will make you happy? 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=672)   They'll talk about something that comes under, it's only a very small part of what I would call happiness. 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=679)   It's legitimate, but I would call it surface happiness for the individual. 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=685)   And here is surface happiness for the individual represented iconically. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=691)   So this is what people think they want, and which they actually do want, and legitimately. 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=700)   It's legitimate to want all this. 
<br>[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=703)   But what people really want is over here, and it's sort of related, this is deep happiness. 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=710)   And if you can have what you think you want and what you really want, then you personally are very happy. 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=718)   But not totally happy, because when you have what you really want, as you'll see in a minute, 
<br>[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=726)   you realize that it's related to what I was saying before, you realize that you is bigger than just one mind and body. 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=734)   So, okay, with respect to the body, well, no, actually let's start down here. 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=745)   You ask the average person, what's happiness for you? 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=749)   They're going to probably answer in this domain, they're going to probably answer down here. 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=756)   So this is like the sun's coming up, right, and this is like rain and lightning and bad weather. 
<br>[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=764)   So most people are going to give you circumstances, objective conditions, that, okay, if I have this, this, and this, 
<br>[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=775)   I'm going to be happy, and they're going to name perhaps some objective conditions, which if I can avoid this, this, and this, 
<br>[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=782)   then I'll also be happy. So I have the job I want, I have the relationship I want, I have the health situation I want, 
<br>[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=790)   I have the financial situation I want, the right people are in power in the government where I live, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=801)   These are all conditions and then I'll be happy. 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=804)   Also, we want to elevate sort of the shiny weather, and I am able to avoid health problems, and I'm able to avoid financial problems, 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=816)   and the people in my life are not behaving in a way that I dislike, etc., etc., then I'll be happy. 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=827)   I think you get the general idea. It's a litany of, remember our picture of the human condition? 
<br>[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=835)   It's a litany of this. I want these good situations, I want to avoid these bad situations. 
<br>[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=843)   So that's what most people will call happiness. But if you look a little more deeply, objective situations, 
<br>[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=851)   the reason they make us happy is because of sensory experiences. 
<br>[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=857)   If I am a success in a way that I want to be a success, what does that really mean? 
<br>[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=866)   That means I get to have the pleasant sensations of people telling me how great I am. A lot. 
<br>[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=872)   I know I'm going to have that day after day. Okay, so knowing that, every time I think that thought, 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=878)   that's a mental image, and a mental talk, and then I get a smiley sensation, and every time somebody tells me how great I am, 
<br>[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=885)   I get a smiley sensation. So the reason I want to be a success is so that I can have certain pleasant emotional sensations in my body on demand. 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=894)   A lot of the time, any time I want to think a certain thought, it feels good in my body, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=902)   So really, in the end, situations are desirable because they're desirable if they give us certain sensory experiences. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=913)   They're undesirable if they give us an opposite sensory experience. So what does the body think it wants? 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=920)   It thinks it wants to elevate pleasant physical sensations and pleasant emotional sensations. 
<br>[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=928)   And it does, and that's fine. And what it wants to avoid is unpleasant physical and unpleasant emotional sensations. 
<br>[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=936)   What does the mind want? The mind wants answers to this or that. And it wants to avoid don't know. 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=946)   So that's all good. But what does the body really want? 
<br>[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=953)   Something like pleasure, but subtly different. I call it fulfillment or satisfaction. What is it? 
<br>[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=963)   It's pleasure multiplied by concentration, clarity, and equanimity. It's the degree to which the body has been trained to have complete experience of pleasure, 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=974)   or a mindful experience of pleasure. Those two phrases mean exactly the same thing in my way of thinking. 
<br>[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=981)   So we think we want intensity, variety, and duration of pleasure, physical and emotional in the body. 
<br>[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=988)   And we do want that, but what we really want is satisfaction from that pleasure. 
<br>[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=999)   And that turns out to be not just a function of the pleasure, but a function of mindful awareness. 
<br>[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1005)   We think we want to avoid discomfort in the body, and that's true and legitimate. 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1011)   But what we really want is to avoid suffering. And it turns out that physical or emotional discomfort is only... 
<br>[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1027)   What turns it into suffering is lack of mindfulness. So fulfillment equals pleasure multiplied by mindful awareness. 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1038)   And suffering equals discomfort divided by mindful awareness. 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1051)   As the mindful awareness gets smaller, the suffering gets larger. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1057)   Okay. What the mind on the surface wants is answers to a lot of things on the outside. 
<br>[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1068)   What the mind in the deep sense wants is the answer, what am I? See here? 
<br>[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1081)   Here the light beams are pointing to lots of things on the outside. 
<br>[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1085)   Here the light is shining back on its own origin, seeing what it's always been plugged into. 
<br>[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1092)   This is called enlightenment or wisdom. 
<br>[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1098)   And actually what we need to avoid is not so much don't know mind. 
<br>[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1105)   In fact, we can't avoid don't know mind. Sooner or later, don't know mind gets us. 
<br>[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1109)   First of all, every answer that you get generates ten new questions. Have you ever thought about that? 
<br>[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1117)   So the answers grow linear, but the don't know grows exponential. 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1122)   So that's number one. Number two, contrary to what every mathematician and scientist would have ever thought in the past, 
<br>[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1135)   it turns out that modern math and modern science have at their core a tremendous appreciation of limits as to what can be known. 
<br>[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1150)   Heisenberg uncertainty in physics, Gödel incompleteness and undecidability in mathematics, don't know moves large in modern science and math. 
<br>[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1167)   And important plays an important role. 
<br>[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1171)   Thirdly, sooner or later, we're going to get old and stupid. All of us. We're going to be faced with don't know. 
<br>[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1189)   So it's good to realize that don't know doesn't have to be a problem. 
<br>[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1198)   See, here's like chaos, confusion, doubt, indecision and a frown. 
<br>[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1207)   This is don't know as a problem. Conditional happiness or surface happiness comes about when we can reduce don't know itself. 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1218)   But it turns out that unconditional happiness or deep happiness is related to the elevation or increase of an experience of don't know with a smile. 
<br>[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1232)   Don't know with a smile is the meaningful experience of meaninglessness. 
<br>[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1241)   That sounds oxymoronic, meaning contradictory in and of itself. Maybe sounds like just some sort of word game. 
<br>[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1251)   But there is such a thing as a meaningful experience of meaninglessness. 
<br>[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1257)   And actually it comes about when you have a sensorially clear, concentrated and a quantum experience of confusion, doubt, indecision and chaos. 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1271)   Then that experience actually starts to taste like something that has meaning. 
<br>[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1281)   Because you're working through the need to know and that leads to a new kind of knowing. 
<br>[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1287)   So in mindfulness practice you get the insights by observing, careful observing and analysis. 
<br>[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1296)   But in Zen practice, for example, at least Rinzai Zen, there's a certain amount of observing, that's true. 
<br>[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1305)   But also there's this, what they call koan practice, you're given a problem that you cannot solve intellectually. 
<br>[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1313)   But then you're pressed to solve it. But you can't. 
<br>[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1317)   And you're thrust into a continuous don't know mind state. 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1323)   Which at some point you stop fighting and then a new kind of knowing starts to flow through you. 
<br>[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1331)   So deep happiness is the experience of don't know in an empowering way. 
<br>[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1341)   So you see the contrast? Get pleasure versus get fulfillment, which is a function of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1352)   Avoid discomfort versus avoid suffering, a function of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1359)   Get answers to this or that, by way of contrast, get the answer. 
<br>[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1366)   Well, this is a function of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1369)   Avoid don't know mind, learn to experience don't know mind as an empowerment. 
<br>[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1376)   Well, this is a function of mindfulness. 
<br>[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1379)   Now here's the objective world in surface happiness. 
<br>[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1387)   Get certain conditions, avoid other conditions. 
<br>[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1390)   The objective world in deep happiness is one's objective behaviors. 
<br>[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1401)   The surface happiness point of view is, I want this, I want to avoid this. 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1407)   The deep happiness point of view is, well, if I can improve this and avoid this, I'm likely to get this. 
<br>[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1416)   So it's putting first things first. 
<br>[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1420)   But how does mindfulness weigh in? 
<br>[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1423)   Well, if situations are to a certain extent, I don't claim 100%, I think chance enters in probably, for sure. 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1433)   But in general, if circumstances are a consequence of behavior, if we have a handle on our behavior with time on average, 
<br>[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1441)   it's likely we're going to get the circumstances we want. 
<br>[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1445)   However, our behaviors are driven by our sensory experiences, our mental image, our mental talk, 
<br>[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1451)   our physical and emotional sensations drive our behavior. 
<br>[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1456)   Mindfulness gives us a handle on our sensory experience, that gives us a handle on our behaviors. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1463)   That tends to lead to surface happiness. 
<br>[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1469)   And besides, concentration and clarity and equanimity not only bring about wisdom mind, they also increase your normal IQ. 
<br>[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1478)   I do not have any scintilla of doubt that in my late 60s, now, I am incomparably smarter than I was in my 20s. 
<br>[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1494)   Just smarter in the sense of regular old intellectual smarts. 
<br>[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1499)   Why did I get smarter and smarter? Because of meditation. 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1505)   So mindfulness affects IQ, I believe. 
<br>[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1510)   So it actually helps with this one. 
<br>[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1515)   And, you know, if you have sensory clarity, that can also help you solve problems, etc. 
<br>[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1522)   You make positive behavior changes, well, you're likely to have more health and less physical problems, etc. 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1534)   As a consequence of this, these two can go up. 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1539)   So mindfulness also has an impact on our surface happiness. 
<br>[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1543)   I don't mean to dissurface happiness by calling it surface. 
<br>[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1548)   It has a role. 
<br>[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1552)   So we want to get both. 
<br>[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1557)   So we want to increase positive behaviors, we want to decrease negative personal behaviors. 
<br>[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1563)   That's the objective piece in deep happiness. 
<br>[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1568)   So I should say, however, that mindful awareness skills alone may not be enough to achieve behavioral changes. 
<br>[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1580)   They're very helpful, but you may need some sort of objective accountability structure, like a 12-step program, a therapist, what have you, for behavior change. 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1595)   In addition to the mindful awareness, they potentiate each other. 
<br>[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4_wLkD6_x4&t=1600)   So that's sort of what these symbols mean. 
<br>
