title: "'Bouncy' Zen vs. 'Paint-by-Numbers' Vipassana ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=0)   I will say in appreciation of the Zen tradition that there is a certain kind of dynamic vitality 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=16)   in the Zen style of enlightenment. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=19)   It's just a style, okay? 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=21)   It's not like, you know, oh, well, Zen starts where all this other stuff ends. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=27)   It's not that way at all. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=28)   I think that's just BS to claim that, okay? 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=32)   But the way that the Zen people express enlightenment in their actions has a kind of bouncy vitality 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=41)   to it and spontaneity that is the result of a certain style of cultivation. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=50)   That's where I see the strongest impact of style. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=54)   People can get enlightenment doing vipassana practice and sometimes it's a sort of inert 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=61)   enlightenment. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=62)   I mean, it's great, okay, compared to non-enlightenment. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=65)   I mean, there's just no comparison. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=67)   But there can sometimes be a kind of flatness to it. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=72)   Not inevitably, I'm just saying sometimes. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=75)   Whereas the Zen people have this sort of bouncy experience of nothingness that they're able 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=85)   to convey. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=86)   What part of the practice of the Zen? 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=89)   It's the lifestyle. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=90)   The Zen lifestyle where, see, basically if I were to contrast vipassana and Zen in a 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=96)   gross oversimplification, I would say that in vipassana you observe your experience first 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=105)   and you come to an experience of the flow of impermanence and then maybe somewhere down 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=111)   the line, maybe you begin to ride on that flow of impermanence in how you speak and 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=118)   move in the world. 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=120)   In Zen, before you realize the impermanent nature of experience, the lifestyle is forcing 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=127)   you to ride on impermanence because you have to run around and stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=132)   Run around like crazy, stop on a dime. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=134)   Sounds like my life. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=135)   Am I doing that? 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=138)   No, because in daily life that just leads to freneticness and confusion. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=146)   But within the context of Zen training, if it works out well, it leads to an ability 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=152)   to manifest and disappear. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=154)   Manifest and disappear in your actions and then with time you come to experience that 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=161)   as being the nature of experience. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=163)   So you sort of act it out first and then realize it. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=168)   So whereas in vipassana you realize it and then maybe ride on it or maybe not. 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=176)   So the advantage to the Zen training when it really works is that it guarantees this 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=181)   dynamic expression of enlightenment. 
<br>[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=184)   The possible disadvantage is because it is in some ways sort of like daily life, maybe 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=190)   if it doesn't work, all it's going to end up doing is making you frenetic and confused. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=196)   So there's advantages and disadvantages. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=200)   The vipassana way of working may not lead to the vitality, but it's like a paint by 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=205)   numbers kit. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=206)   It's likely to at least lead to something like a work of art. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=213)   Zen is sort of like, here's the canvas, there's the paints. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=220)   Now do it. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=221)   But when it works, it has a stunning vitality to it that you may not find in the paint by 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WiM-w5qqmE&t=227)   numbers kit.
