<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=0)   Yes, in tribal cultures, this is interesting. Tribal cultures typically do not have a technical 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=24)   vocabulary for these kinds of things. Typically, they do not have systematic exercises. That's 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=36)   characteristic of literate civilizations. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=45)   So, when these tribal cultures encounter the elaborate philosophical and technological 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=64)   cultures of the modern world, previously there had been a tendency to sort of think of themselves 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=77)   as being less than, because it's like, wow, all these ideas and the literate cultures 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=87)   foster that notion. And I don't just mean imperialistic Western culture, there's also 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=95)   imperialistic Chinese culture. I mean, it's a human thing, okay? But actually, it's exactly 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=103)   the opposite. It's actually to the credit of those tribal cultures that they didn't 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=111)   have techniques and didn't have concepts, in a sense. Why? Because they didn't need 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=118)   techniques and they didn't need concepts, they actually experienced the stuff as part 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=125)   of their daily life and as part of their rituals, their ceremonies. So, whereas the literate 
<br>[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=137)   cultures had words for things but weren't necessarily actually having experiences, the 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=145)   tribal cultures didn't need the words or the techniques. Life and ceremony sort of 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=152)   did it for people. So, I would say, you know, it's not elaborated like that. Yet, having 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=162)   said that, look what's implied, we'll just take one example of a tribal situation, the 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=170)   one I'm most familiar with, which is Native American, specifically the Lakota or Western 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=179)   Sioux approach to things. If you sort of look at the symbolism of the ceremonies, it's 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=185)   all about complementary polarities. The sacred object, representative sacred object is the 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=196)   pipe. That pipe has a bowl made of earth and a stem made of wood. And they're kept separate. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=206)   The bowl stands for Mother Earth, which is a contractive force. The stem stands for Father 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=215)   Sky, which is an expansive force. The tree grows up to the sky. Eventually, the bowl 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=221)   goes back into the earth, okay, to its source. So, you have these two, you're actually holding 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=230)   in your hands the fundamental forces of the universe. And when you bring them together, 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=238)   okay, then there's an empowering to do things. When you do the sun dance, you dance around 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=249)   a cottonwood tree or aspen, and they're forked like that, okay. So, it's one becoming two, 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=259)   becoming one. That's what you're looking at for four days. There's different ways that 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=269)   people get pierced. You may have seen in movies like that movie, The Man Called Horse. By 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=276)   the way, unlike in that movie, no one screams and cries, okay. But let's say you get pierced 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=283)   the way it's shown in that movie. So, you get hauled up by these skewers, and you are 
<br>[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=294)   now completely at the mercy of an expansive force of the sky that's pulling your flesh 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=304)   up, the contractive force of the earth. Those forces are totally beyond what any human mind 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=313)   can deal with. So, you just have to surrender to that, and however long it takes for that 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=324)   which is caught in between the fundamental forces to give, exemplified by about a square 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=334)   inch of skin on either side, you just have to wait. At the moment when it breaks and 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=344)   you fall to the ground is when your prayer is delivered to the source. So, this sort 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=351)   of polarity thing is over the, symbolically it's all there. It's there in the ceremonies. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=361)   I've heard one medicine person, when you start a sweat lodge, okay, you put five rocks in 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=372)   the center like that. So, one medicine man said that actually the original Lakota way 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=383)   was there was just four rocks indicating the basic, the directions, okay. And the source, 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=397)   God, Tonka-ashila, was represented by the absence. But because people couldn't wrap 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=405)   their mind around that, they ended up actually putting something there just to symbolize 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=411)   that. So, I could go on and on, and I'm sorry for getting digressed, but you asked about 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=416)   tribal cultures. I think it's there in the life, it's there in the symbolism, it's 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=422)   there in the ceremonies. It is not as I've ever been able to see there in terms of organized 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=430)   techniques or philosophical concepts, but as I say, I don't think that that represents 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=435)   a less than situation. I think it represents a better than situation. They didn't need 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=441)   that stuff. They just lived it, or at least some of them. I'm not saying all our remote 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E9p11Kz2Ow&t=446)   ancestors were like that, but is that a sufficient answer about tribal?
