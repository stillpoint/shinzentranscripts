title: "WHERE DOES LOVE COME IN?  ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=0)   So, tonight's our last night, and there were several requests to talk about the iconic 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=19)   representation of human happiness, so I'm going to do that. First, though, I want to 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=28)   respond to a question, actually Aisha gave a really good question, and so I just want 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=36)   to briefly respond to that, which is, on this path, where does the love come from? I think 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=43)   that was the takeaway piece, right? 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=45)   Where does it fit in? 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=48)   Yeah, where does it fit in? So, I would say that the actual word that's used in a lot 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=58)   of the Buddhist world is, this would be the, God, I'm forgetting how to write Chinese. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=74)   Is it, or lose it? Good enough? Alright. Yeah, yeah, this guy's familiar too. Pretty sure 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=89)   it doesn't have that stuff, right? 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=94)   Tsebe in Mandarin Chinese, jihi in Japanese. This one means love, it's maitri in Sanskrit, 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=107)   metta and pali, this corresponds to the love, and garuna, compassion. And these are sort 
<br>[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=120)   of linked concepts, so when you say where does the love come from, within a sort of 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=125)   Buddhist way of thinking of things, it's where does the maitri, garuna, come from, or how 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=130)   does it fit in? 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=134)   So that got me thinking, and it seems to me that within the framework that I present to 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=142)   you, the procedures and the categories, it comes from four sources. One is, it's just 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=153)   natural. Human beings are born with a natural sense of love. In fact, because I'm getting 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=164)   sort of Chinese tonight, but there's a word in Chinese that means, according to Confucius, 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=173)   it carries this sense of the natural love that everyone's born with. It's pronounced 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=180)   ran, and it's the character for person and the character for two. So it's like the natural 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=188)   thing for people is to love each other. That's the way we're born, according to Confucius. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=194)   So then what happens? Well, what happens is that we accumulate a lot of poison and pain, 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=201)   and our primordial sort of instinct to love gets covered over by many physical, emotional, 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=213)   mental, uncomfortable experiences in the process from infancy on the process of socialization, 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=222)   the process of discovering that the physical world can hurt you. That natural, spontaneous 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=234)   love gets covered over. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=236)   So as we work through that stored poison and pain, as it percolates up in our practice, 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=245)   and we essentially don't do anything about it, we just open up to it and let it dissipate, 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=251)   don't reinforce it. So that stored poison and pain gets worked through. And to the extent 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=260)   that the suffering, the seeds of suffering are being extirpated from us, to that extent 
<br>[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=268)   that primordial love just gets uncovered again. It's always been there. So that's one source 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=276)   of it. Another source, actually related but a little different side to it, is, remember 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=284)   it's compassion and love. So that the struggles that we go through when we do this path, particularly 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=297)   in the beginning, and gotta be honest, the beginning's about the first 20 years. Particularly 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=305)   in the beginning. Particularly in the beginning of the beginning, which is maybe the first 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=311)   five years. We are very, very, typically we humans who take on this path are very uncomfortable 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=320)   while we're doing the practice. I mean, we do everything we can to show you how to have 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=326)   fun and so forth, but there's the achiness of the body, there's the scatteredness in 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=335)   the mind, there's all sorts of emotions, confusions, sleepiness. And within the context of North 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=345)   American vipassana practice, of course you can take a break any time you want, but within 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=350)   the Asian sort of traditional training and whatever, if you're in a monastery, there 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=357)   are no breaks. It's merciless. And it can be pretty damn hellacious during those initial 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=368)   years of training. So you might say, well, gee, that's sort of like really bad, but the 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=375)   effect of that is to impart within a person an unforgettable lesson in the nature of human 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=387)   misery. I know you wonder, like, why do I have to face all this shit when I sit here? 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=394)   My personal shit. Well, part of it is that later on down the line, when to a certain 
<br>[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=402)   extent that's gotten worked through, you will never forget how miserable you were and you'll 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=409)   realize that most human beings live in that kind of misery. And you will have a sense 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=417)   of compassion for them because of what you had to go through. So that's one of the uses. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=424)   You don't realize it at the time. At the time, it's just like, you know, why does this have 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=429)   to be so hard? Why am I so miserable? Et cetera, et cetera. But then you look back and you 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=435)   realize, oh, I was learning a lesson that's going to stay with me for my entire life. 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=443)   I really know what it means to be miserable. I can tell you in the monastery in Japan, 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=452)   I definitely knew what it meant to be miserable 24-7. And it was relative to Japanese standards, 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=461)   by no means the most rigorous kind of environment. Now, the most rigorous training environment 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=470)   in Japan is myoshinji, zen temple. It's called oni-sodo. Oni-zendo. Sodo and zendo, they 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=480)   mean the same thing. Oni-zendo. Oni in Japanese means demon. Demon meditation hall. The expression 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=490)   is for the first three years, the novice never shows the white of their teeth, meaning they 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=499)   never smile once in the first three years of the training. It's just abject misery. 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=507)   Kurushimi no renzoku in Japanese, it means like an unending sequence of miseries. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=518)   But as the result of that, it produces people like Sasaki Roshi, my teacher Sasaki Roshi. 
<br>[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=526)   That's where he trained. 10 years at least, I'm thinking, at myoshinji. And now 104, the 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=537)   activity of compassion does not stop. There's no retiring, there's no vacations. It's all, 
<br>[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=545)   it's like all service all the time to anyone who wants to do the practice. Where does that 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=553)   kind of vitality come from? Where does that endless patience come from? From those horrific 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=561)   early years where, you know, he will never forget the misery of the average human being, 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=570)   however transcendent he becomes, and he'll care. So there's a, it's compassion and it's love. 
<br>[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=577)   So one thing is, well, as you work through your poison and pain, the natural love is just there. 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=584)   Another is that in the process of working through your own poison and pain, you have to face your 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=591)   poison and pain. And that gives you this sense of compassion for the human condition. That's 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=601)   the gold standard of spirituality is love of the human condition. It's beyond love of humanity. 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=612)   I mean, you can love humanity, but you have to love the human condition, which is really screwed 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=618)   up. So that's another source. Then there's merging. There's I-thou, there's the experience of other 
<br>[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=633)   as yourself. And that comes in two flavors, relative and absolute. Most of you are familiar 
<br>[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=639)   with the focus out technique, where you anchor yourself in the physical senses, sights, and so 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=644)   forth. That causes a relative merging of inside and outside. So you experience other as yourself, 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=652)   quite literally, not as a concept, but as an actual sensory event, because it's all about 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=658)   expansion and contraction. And so if the touch, sight, sound of another expands, and you allow 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=663)   the image talk and emotional body of your subject of world to contract, then you experience other 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=673)   as self. And if you have many, many, many experiences like that, well, that leads to an 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=679)   I-thou relationship with other, as opposed to an I-it, or we're still an us versus them relationship. 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=688)   So that merging that comes about by focusing out, that's a relative oneness. And so that with which 
<br>[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=699)   you are one, you naturally feel some love for. Then there's the absolute merging, which is to share 
<br>[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=706)   zero. Not only does the subject disappear, the object disappears, and you and the other abide 
<br>[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=715)   in the source. The dimensionless point before the big bang of each moment of self and world, 
<br>[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=726)   each mind moment, is a sort of little version of the big bang, a little big bang, 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=734)   like little big man or something. So we have these little big bangs. 
<br>[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=741)   And before each little big bang, quote before, there is the one, the singular, the singularity, 
<br>[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=750)   the zero. And so having those absolute merging experiences with people, you come to 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=760)   the sense that we all sort of have our feet placed, whether we know it or not, 
<br>[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=766)   we all have our feet placed on the same groundless ground. And so that gives you 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=774)   another reason for viewing others as brother and sister. You share the womb, the formless womb. 
<br>[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=785)   That's what brother and sister in Greek, adelphos, it means a delphos. A means share and delphos is 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=796)   womb. So that which you share the womb, the formless womb, the same source, naturally there's 
<br>[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=803)   a sense of love and concern. So those are, I can think of within the theoretical and practice 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p8i25RjNiU&t=814)   framework that I give you, that that would be four places where that love comes from, comes in. 
<br>
