title: "When Sensory Experience Loses Its 'Something-ness' ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=0)   In early Buddhism, there's a big emphasis on the notion of what's called Udayabhaya 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=20)   in practice. So, aya means to go, ut is up, and vi is away. So, udaya is arising, something 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=38)   udaya, rises up, and then vyaya is passing. So, you've probably heard of arising and passing 
<br>[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=51)   as a stage that people go through in their practice where the perception is dominated 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=65)   by a sense of coming and going. So, when you begin your practice, you're just all over 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=77)   the map. Remember that? Sometimes it's still like that for me too. You're just all over 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=86)   the map. We'll talk a little bit more about all over the map a little later. But you're 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=96)   all over the map and you can't concentrate and you long for the ability to concentrate 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=103)   and some sort of tranquility and ease. And then you actually start to experience more 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=113)   tranquility and ease and your focus improves. And then things get sort of interesting because 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=123)   now you have like a little secret thing that you can do anytime you want. You can taste 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=129)   samadhi, samadhi rasa, the taste of being in a concentrated state becomes available 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=138)   to you not only during formal practice, but also as you're sort of bopping around in the 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=148)   world. So, that's really nice. And I can remember when that started to come on for me. And it's 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=155)   like, wow, I got this secret thing that I can do now anytime in the day. So, it's like 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=163)   I'll never waste any time again. Either what I'm doing is intrinsically meaningful for 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=171)   me or I'm forced to do something that's meaningless like wait in line or be uncomfortable like 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=181)   I'm sick or something. And those times that would have been like really crappy at best 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=191)   but now may be uncomfortable. Now these are my secret times because I can use them to 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=198)   cultivate and deepen this taste of concentration. So, that's a nice stage and really starts 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=207)   to change the way that you think about things. Like Don Juan in the Carlos Castaneda book 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=214)   said, most people think of the day in terms of fortune and misfortune, but a person who 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=222)   is on a path to being able to see, S-E-E, thinks of the day in terms of a sequence of 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=229)   challenges. So, I can remember this really nice stage when the day became just a sequence 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=238)   of okay, can I do this and still taste a little bit of concentration? Can I do this more complex, 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=244)   complicated thing and still taste a little bit of concentration? So, that's nice. Then 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=252)   you're able to use that concentration if you're doing a sort of deconstructive, classic mindfulness 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=259)   approach to things. You're able to untangle the strands of self. Now in early Buddhism, 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=269)   the self is analysed into components in a number of different ways, but the five aggregates, 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=277)   you can look it up on Wikipedia if you want, the five skandhas, are sort of the classic 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=283)   deconstruction of the somethingness of selfhood. The idea is, okay, if you can untangle and 
<br>[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=292)   unblock these, then you will see that there is no thing inside you called a self. So, 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=303)   in my case, I have applied Occam's razor, which says, well, do things as simply as you 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=310)   can. What I've found is that you just need three elements to get a core sense of I am-ness, 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=320)   mental image, mental talk, and body emotion as a system. Sure enough, if you are able 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=328)   to untangle those, you start to get some liberation from the sense of self as a separate, suffering, 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=339)   limited entity. So, that's nice. You bring sensory clarity now to the picture and you're 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=347)   sort of untangling. That's quite liberating, but then at an even deeper level, things simplify 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=358)   further. You get a sense that everything is just arising and passing, arising and passing. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=371)   That's true for your inner sense of self, but it's also true even for the sight, sounds, 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=378)   and physical touches that would constitute the perception of an external world. In fact, 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=385)   the distinction between inside and outside breaks down when you're in a situation of 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=393)   arising and passing. So, everything gets really, really simplified. There's just this constant 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=400)   rhythm of things rising up, things passing away, rising up, passing away. As that is 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=415)   happening, you get a sense that each of these arising and passing moments is accompanied 
<br>[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=431)   by a taste of purification. This is really hard to put into words. So, as it's arising, 
<br>[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=444)   it's sort of like vibrating and arising. You get the sense that the somethingness of that 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=457)   experience is sort of dissipating. In fact, sometimes I get... Now, this is just a mental 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=464)   image, right? It's just what I'm about to describe is just a representation that happens 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=472)   in my image space. You might not have this same representation, but just to share, I 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=479)   get this sense that each inner or outer, see, hear, feel, big or small, whatever it is, 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=486)   it's sort of like this bubble that rises up and then passes away, arising, passing. It's 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=492)   vibrating as it's arising, and it's vibrating as it's passing. I get in image space this 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=498)   image of like this black smoke is coming out of it and sort of like dissipating in all 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=507)   directions. That black smoke is the somethingness of that sensory event. The somethingness of 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=519)   it is being released and freeing up the pure doingness of it. It actually is becoming transparent, 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=532)   like you can see through it. The color of the modalities, visual, auditory, somatic, 
<br>[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=541)   or the color of pleasant versus unpleasant, or mind versus body, any sort of quality that 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=554)   would, quote, color that experience is like being dissipated as this sort of... The black 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=564)   smoke would sort of represent the opacity or the thingness of that experience, and it's 
<br>[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=572)   like dissipating. Now, once again, this is just an image, a representation in my image 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=578)   space of a taste of something. What it's the taste of is that sensory experience is becoming 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=588)   transparent. It's losing its somethingness. Actually, there's what they call the three 
<br>[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=605)   vimokshas. This is a technical term. You can look it up. It's sort of interesting. It's 
<br>[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=613)   not a commonly used set of categories in Buddhism, but it is traditional. They're called vimoksha 
<br>[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=622)   dvara, the three gates of liberation that you go through to get free from the somethingness 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=632)   of self and world, the coagulation of self and world into a suffering thing. There are 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=644)   these three vimoksha dvaras, or gates of liberation. That's why temples in Japan, Buddhist temples, 
<br>[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=657)   they're called vimokshas. The first thing you encounter when you approach is like a 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=664)   three gate situation, and it's supposed to remind you of these three gates of liberation. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=670)   Anyway, one of the gates of liberation is emptiness, shunyata. Another one is animitta, 
<br>[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=683)   which means without somethingness or without, no, a better translation, without essence, 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=691)   essenceless. Now, essenceless sounds sort of bad, but it means without any limiting 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=700)   quality. Then the last one is very interesting, apranidhana, which means effortlessness. Everything 
<br>[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=713)   in the world is vacuous, essenceless, and just occurs spontaneously. Now, I know those 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=728)   words don't sound very appealing, but actually it's just bliss city when you start to have 
<br>[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=737)   these experiences. So I can actually sort of get the sense that the essence or the thingness 
<br>[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=751)   is dissipating, and the experience is almost like it's becoming transparent. Self and world 
<br>[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=761)   are becoming transparent. And sure enough, also there is a kind of delicious spontaneity 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=774)   or effortless, will-less, just happeningness in the arisings and passings. So that's the 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=783)   three gates of liberation that you pass through the vimoksha dvara to realize nirvana. So 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=797)   all of this that I'm describing is a consequence of clarity and equanimity. So everything simplifies 
<br>[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=810)   to this theme of arising and passing, arising and passing. And even if you're going through 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=816)   something excruciating in the body, even if you're going through something confusing in 
<br>[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=821)   the mind, the flavor of excruciation or the flavor of confusion are sort of like being 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=830)   dissipated and they're being replaced by this one flavor, this ekarasa, which is the taste 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=839)   of freedom. So this is sort of the classic description of A&P, some Western teachers 
<br>[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=854)   call it A&P, like my friend Kenneth Folk, arising and passing. It's an important stage. 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=862)   Now the way I like to approach things is that if you do enough practice, this experience 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=878)   that I'm describing becomes available anytime you want. It's not like something that's rare, 
<br>[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=887)   happens occasionally, or it's like a special thing that happens on a retreat. You want 
<br>[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=893)   to move in the direction that any time during the day you can just go into what I just described. 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=905)   And for some people that comes on more quickly in their practice, for some people it takes 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=911)   a little bit longer. But we're in this for the long haul. You know, my stock phrase, 
<br>[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=919)   I'm not going to promise you something that is necessarily a quick fix, but I do promise 
<br>[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=930)   you a deep fix. But we're engaged in a householder's practice here, we're not locked in a cave 
<br>[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=940)   in Tibet or in the forest of Southeast Asia or doing like samurai bootcamp training in 
<br>[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=949)   Japan in a Zen temple. We're bopping around living North American lives. And so we sort 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=956)   of have to amortize our ego death over long periods of time. You could think of it as 
<br>[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=963)   a kinder, gentler form of ego death, as opposed to say Zen, where, oh my God, some of you 
<br>[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=973)   know, basically they just pull the rug out from under you. It's impossible to get comfortable 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=980)   and it's simply impossible. The day is just a sequence of physical, mental, and conceptual 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=991)   assaults on your being. Kurushimi no renzoku is one way I've heard it described, an endless 
<br>[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1005)   sequence of miseries. Some of you speak Japanese. Kurushimi no renzoku. At the beginning, that's 
<br>[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1014)   what it is. So what are you going to do? Well, you either leave or you're driven into the 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1029)   only place of relief, which is this arising, passing thing. And yes, that can happen fairly 
<br>[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1039)   quickly under those severe monastic training situations. But we're not in that. We've made 
<br>[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1045)   a different choice. We want the kinder, gentler version. So, okay, fine. I'm not saying that 
<br>[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1052)   what I just described to you will necessarily happen in the first year, even the first five 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1057)   years of your practice, but time will happen. Time will pass. And you might be saying, yeah, 
<br>[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1065)   but I'm old, so I don't have a lot of time. Well, you know what I'm going to say with 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1069)   respect to that? The aging process can be an ally to liberation. It's sort of a natural 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc7gHjEAGd0&t=1084)   pointing towards no self. So one way or another, we've got time. 
<br>
