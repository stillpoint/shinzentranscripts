title: "'AUTO-CHANT' or 'AUTO-SPEAK'  ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=0)   Most people, at least occasionally in their life, have had the experience of just sort 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=14)   of starting to flap their lips and magically something self-organized. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=21)   I call that auto-speak. 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=25)   So I wondered, is there a way to sort of train people so that that's more likely to happen 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=32)   in their daily life? 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=34)   So one way to do that is through a process that I call auto-chant. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=40)   You take something that you're very familiar with. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=43)   Some people use mantras or scriptures, but it can be anything that you're thoroughly 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=50)   familiar with, and you chant it out loud, and you just sort of let your speech organs 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=55)   self-organize. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=57)   So it's the auditory analog of the auto-walk. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=63)   Now we want techniques that we can use in a secular context, say in a clinical medical 
<br>[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=70)   situation or in a school, so we won't encourage people to use things that are explicitly religious 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=78)   or from a foreign culture when we go into these mainstream situations. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=86)   But I mean, if you belong to a certain religion or like a certain culture, you can chant things 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=91)   like Om Namah Shivaya or Om Mani Padme Hum or Pater Noster, Ave Maria, whatever appeals 
<br>[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=104)   to you. 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=105)   But in a secular context, I like to use something simple, so maybe numbers. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=111)   So here's auto-chant by the numbers. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=115)   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=122)   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=127)   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=131)   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=134)   And I'm sort of tuning in to the fact that there's just air blowing across my teeth and 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=141)   tissues are flapping and they sort of know what to do. 
<br>[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=145)   And it's fun. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=148)   I should say that in some religious traditions, they have what's called glossolalia. 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=155)   And by the way, that's not just in charismatic Christian things in North America. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=161)   There are analogs of that in other cultures. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=164)   I saw it in Japan at Mount Koya, for example. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=169)   And something like that happens in subud, which is in an Islamic context in Indonesia. 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=178)   This is what's called speaking in tongues. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=181)   Now what's significant about the glossolalia or speaking in tongues is it's auto. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=189)   So actually, they're right. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=190)   It is sort of the spirit. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=192)   Now sometimes there's a belief that they're actually speaking grammatical human languages 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=198)   like Aramaic or what have you. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=203)   Unfortunately, that is apparently not the case. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=210)   So the content may not actually be human speech, but the contour is truly the spirit. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=217)   So there's a validity to that, and it can be honored as that. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6vfdgkFRws&t=223)   So that's auto speak.
