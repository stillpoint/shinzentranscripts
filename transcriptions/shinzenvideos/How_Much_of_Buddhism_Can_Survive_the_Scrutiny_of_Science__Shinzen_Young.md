title: "How Much of Buddhism Can Survive the Scrutiny of Science? ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=0)   Traditionally in Buddhism, there's a criterion that the Buddha gave when his students said, 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=21)   how can we know if something is consonant with your teaching? 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=30)   And that criterion is called the pavalakshana. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=37)   So pava means existence, and if that sounds like the English word be, it's not a coincidence. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=44)   So existence. 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=45)   And lakshana is a mark or characteristic. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=49)   So I said, well, if you teach these three marks of existence, then that's consonant 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=57)   with what all the Buddhas teach. 
<br>[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=62)   So if you're interested in these kinds of topics, it's good to actually learn the Pali. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=73)   So anicca, most of you know that. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=77)   Can you say it? 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=78)   Anicca. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=80)   Anatta. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=82)   Anatta. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=83)   Dukkha. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=84)   Dukkha. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=85)   So I didn't take AHA. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=86)   This is the Pali pronunciation. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=88)   So dukkha is usually translated as suffering, anicca, impermanence, and anatta, no self. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=95)   These are the marks of existence. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=100)   So not everyone in the world thinks Buddhism is right. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=107)   You can go on the internet and find all sorts of critiques and criticisms of Buddhism. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=116)   So I think it's important to think very clearly about these kinds of things. 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=126)   If you want to be able to sort of untangle different things that people say and have 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=138)   productive conversations. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=140)   So because I'm pretty much a logic and evidence-based guy, I tend to think of myself as a rationalist 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=153)   and empiricist, so I have to ask myself in all honesty, how much of that can survive 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=169)   the critique of science? 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=171)   How much of Buddhism can survive the closest scrutiny and last into this century and last 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=186)   for a long, long time? 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=190)   When I ask myself that question in a very uncensored way, it seems to me that actually 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=207)   quite a bit can survive, which is extraordinary when you think about it, given how old Buddhism 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=216)   is and so forth. 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=218)   I don't think it can all survive, though, the scrutiny of science, but so what? 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=227)   The parts that can survive are enormously useful and powerful. 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=236)   So time will tell. 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=239)   But let's begin with dukkha, the claim that suffering is, that the nature of existence 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=256)   is suffering. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=260)   What about this will stem the scrutiny of careful investigation and what might not? 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=270)   Well, first off, we're a little bit hit with a problem, because a major feature in the 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=278)   formulation of dukkha is the assumption that we live multiple lives, that we in fact reincarnate, 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=287)   and that most life forms are uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=295)   In the West, there's a tendency to find reincarnation a comforting thought. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=302)   Oh, I'll be reincarnated. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=304)   I'm coming back. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=305)   I'm coming back. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=307)   But in India, that is not a comforting thought at all. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=313)   It's a scary, horrible thought, because Westerners typically always imagine that they're going 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=322)   to come back. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=325)   Well, first of all, they imagine they have been like Egyptian princesses. 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=332)   I was the advisor to the king, or I was a llama in Tibet. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=340)   And then the assumption is when I come back, maybe I'll be the president of the United 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=346)   States. 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=348)   But the Buddhist notion, the traditional Buddhist notion, is that pleasant incarnations are 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=356)   extremely rare. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=360)   Someone once asked the biophysicist, one of the founders of biophysics, Hal Dane, if he 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=369)   could discern any characteristic of God by having studied the mathematics of biology. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=379)   Some of you are laughing. 
<br>[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=381)   His response was very funny. 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=386)   He said, well, apparently God has an inordinate fondness for beetles. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=392)   There are more beetle species far and away than anything else. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=397)   So your probability of your next thousand lives being a beetle is very high, whereas 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=408)   being the vizier of the pharaoh or whatever, not very probable at all. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=418)   In fact, even a fairly decent life where you get a chance to hear about meditation and 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=427)   maybe practice it, but at least you've heard the dharma, you know what the traditional 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=432)   metaphor for how rare that is? 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=435)   Some of you do. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=437)   Well, there's a bunch of ones. 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=439)   But there's this piece of wood that's floating in the ocean and has a little hole in it. 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=449)   And there is a turtle in the ocean. 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=453)   And the probability that when the turtle sticks his head out of the water, it will go through 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=460)   that exact point is the probability that you'll hear the dharma in your next lifetime. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=467)   Of course, the lesson in that case is use this opportunity, okay? 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=475)   So part of the notion of suffering that's pretty intrinsic in traditional Buddhism and 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=483)   always talked about is most forms of existence are uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=489)   And so the statement that suffering is the nature of existence is somewhat based on that 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=500)   notion. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=502)   So is there compelling evidence that in fact we have multiple lives? 
<br>[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=510)   Not that I can see. 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=512)   On the other hand, if it were to turn out that we have multiple lives, personally I 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=518)   would not be in the slightest surprised. 
<br>[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=521)   Not in the slightest. 
<br>[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=523)   If the Buddhist tradition turns out to be absolutely correct in this regard, it wouldn't 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=529)   surprise me at all. 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=531)   But that's not really the same as compelling evidence. 
<br>[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=536)   You know, Carl Sagan's thing about extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=547)   Now, does it, is it, how can I put it, does it make, can I understand why someone would 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=555)   think we reincarnate? 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=557)   Absolutely. 
<br>[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=558)   Because, remember, I've talked several times about these states where you appreciate the 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=570)   full extent of what happens in the deep mind moment by moment, even when you're just processing 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=578)   ordinary sensory experience. 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=581)   The deep mind in the limit spreads out to encompass this and as far as I can see, all 
<br>[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=589)   conceivable worlds. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=591)   It points to that. 
<br>[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=594)   I'm not saying it literally contains that. 
<br>[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=597)   But it's a mandala and it's like a fractal and it just, as you sort of look down into 
<br>[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=606)   that, where it's pointing to is all worlds. 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=610)   And it is, this is called the experience of boundless consciousness. 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=615)   And it's part of the jhana system. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=618)   But it's nothing mystical schmistical. 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=620)   It's something you can access just by observing image space very, very carefully, very, very 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=629)   deeply. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=630)   And it's, you are that, okay? 
<br>[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=637)   That's all in each of us. 
<br>[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=640)   And it's very easy to identify with any particular part of that and say, oh yeah, I, you know, 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=648)   I'm that part, I'm that part, because we're all of it. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=653)   So meditators, people that have looked deeply within, it's not surprising that they would 
<br>[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=664)   come up with the notion of, well, you jump from life to life based on your behavior, 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=670)   et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=672)   So it's not an insignificant perception, and to come to the point where you have that kind 
<br>[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=680)   of awareness, that depth of contact with how the visual mind works is a very significant 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=689)   stage in practice. 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=692)   However, is that hard-nosed evidence that in fact we reincarnate? 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=700)   Can we show scientists compelling evidence whereby they must accept this doctrine? 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=710)   Not yet. 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=712)   Maybe someday. 
<br>[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=714)   Maybe never. 
<br>[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=716)   Now, maybe it's a little shocking to you to hear someone who works within the Buddhist 
<br>[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=721)   tradition sort of say something like this, but I've been on stage with the Dalai Lama 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=728)   of Tibet, like closer to him than I am to St. Pan right now, and heard him say, if science 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=736)   should someday prove that in fact there is no reincarnation, then we have to modify Buddhism 
<br>[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=746)   to match that. 
<br>[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=748)   That's the Dalai Lama of Tibet, whose entire power base is predicated on this entire system, 
<br>[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=755)   okay? 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=756)   So, you know, if you want a gripe, don't come to me. 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=760)   He's got my back. 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=762)   Thank God. 
<br>[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=765)   Thank Gama Lungi De Svara. 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=768)   I don't know if you ever see him. 
<br>[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=771)   Now, why bother saying something like this? 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=774)   Well, the reason is because I think a lot can survive the scrutiny of science, and that's 
<br>[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=782)   important. 
<br>[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=784)   That's like really important for the future of humanity. 
<br>[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=789)   So, what about this notion that the nature of suffering, the existence is by nature suffering? 
<br>[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=799)   To me it's contentious to predicate that on the belief that we reincarnate and that pleasant 
<br>[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=808)   lives are very rare. 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=811)   However, let's see what we can say that more or less is not contentious, that no one would 
<br>[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=819)   disagree with. 
<br>[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=821)   To what extent is suffering the nature of existence? 
<br>[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=829)   Well, one of the things that you learn with this practice is that although pain is unavoidable, 
<br>[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=843)   physical and emotional pain are unavoidable, suffering is in fact optional. 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=852)   Suffering is what happens when you experience pain without skill. 
<br>[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=859)   When you have an incomplete experience of pain, it's suffering. 
<br>[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=866)   To the extent that you start to bring concentration, clarity, and of course equanimity, major factor, 
<br>[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=875)   to that extent the pain becomes more poignant and less problematic, it still motivates and 
<br>[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=882)   directs. 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=883)   It doesn't drive and distort. 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=886)   It's part of the richness of being a human, but it does not haul our existence. 
<br>[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=896)   So, when you look around and you realize that suffering is optional and then you look at 
<br>[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=906)   how much suffering there is, you realize that an enormous amount of what people go through 
<br>[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=916)   from the intrapsychic to the interpersonal to the international level and intercommunity 
<br>[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=923)   level in between, there is an enormous amount of absolutely avoidable suffering going on. 
<br>[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=935)   And that's, I think, that gives credence to this view that certainly the nature of existence 
<br>[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=951)   for people that don't work hard on themselves entails an enormous amount of suffering. 
<br>[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=962)   So, I think that stands the test of logic and evidence. 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=971)   And it's important to know. 
<br>[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=973)   It's like hugely important to know. 
<br>[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=979)   So, there's that. 
<br>[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=981)   There's also something else. 
<br>[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=984)   The Buddhist tradition says that even pleasant things are unpleasant, which seems, maybe 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=994)   doesn't, does not seem to ring true to people. 
<br>[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1001)   But it's all a matter of, it's relative, I guess might be one way to put it. 
<br>[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1014)   What people call pleasurable, relative to the experience of complete pleasure, is actually painful. 
<br>[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1026)   It's slightly uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1029)   But you don't realize that until you start to have experiences of complete pleasure. 
<br>[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1036)   What most people seek in pleasure is intensity, duration, and variety. 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1042)   Not actually that there's anything wrong with those things. 
<br>[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1046)   But there's another dimension, which is not the dimension of any of those three, intensity 
<br>[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1054)   and variety or duration. 
<br>[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1060)   There's another dimension, which is how fully you experience the pleasure, which is measured 
<br>[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1070)   by how much concentration, clarity, and equanimity you bring to the pleasure. 
<br>[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1075)   And once you start to have some experiences that are starting to approach pure pleasure, 
<br>[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1085)   pleasure unalloyed with craving and aversion and gaps in awareness and unconsciousness, 
<br>[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1092)   pure pleasure is actually pure fulfillment. 
<br>[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1097)   And relative to that, when you look back at, quote, ordinary experiences of pleasure that 
<br>[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1105)   you had as a non-meditator or in the early years of your practice, there's a kind of 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1112)   coagulation and tension around it that is subtly painful. 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1122)   So this is not obvious until you've done a bit of meditation. 
<br>[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1130)   But I think this is another way in which the Buddhist claim about the suffering nature 
<br>[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1136)   of things does pass the test of logic and evidence. 
<br>[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1143)   Evidence meaning you can check it out yourself and see if it's not true. 
<br>[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1149)   And relative to nirvana, which is the limit of complete experience, so complete that it 
<br>[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1162)   is right on the cusp of existence and non-existence, relative to nirvana, everything hurts. 
<br>[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1172)   Subtly, subtly, subtly, but subtly significant. 
<br>[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1177)   So actually, I think the Buddhist doctrine does pretty good about the suffering nature 
<br>[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1188)   of things. 
<br>[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1191)   There's also the flip side, which is the nature of suffering, which I've already sort of mentioned, 
<br>[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1198)   at least the way I think about it. 
<br>[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1201)   The nature of suffering is what happens when we have uncomfortable experiences without 
<br>[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1211)   concentration, clarity, and equanimity. 
<br>[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1214)   And it's also what happens when we have neutral experiences without those. 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1218)   And it's also what happens when we have pleasant experiences without those. 
<br>[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1224)   This is one of the first insights that I had in my meditation career. 
<br>[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1236)   As you all know, I approached Buddhism in the old-fashioned way. 
<br>[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1243)   It was old school. 
<br>[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1244)   It was Asia. 
<br>[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1247)   And they made me sit in the full lotus for a full hour, hour after hour. 
<br>[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1259)   And it was all about pain. 
<br>[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1262)   It was all about pain. 
<br>[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1264)   I thought, this is Looney Tunes. 
<br>[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1268)   But that's it. 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1271)   Take it or leave it. 
<br>[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1273)   That's the way we do it. 
<br>[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1276)   But it was so worth it, because you're sitting there, and it's getting worse and worse and 
<br>[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1284)   worse. 
<br>[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1285)   And then at some point, discrimination, vipassana, seeing separate. 
<br>[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1293)   You actually see that the pain is one thing, and the fighting with the pain is another 
<br>[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1302)   thing. 
<br>[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1303)   They are different critters. 
<br>[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1306)   And before that, you never noticed, because as soon as there was the pain, there was the 
<br>[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1313)   fighting. 
<br>[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1314)   So someday, some tricky lawyer is going to do some tort case where they're going to say, 
<br>[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1324)   well, this person's a Buddhist, so they can only be recompensed for the pain, not the 
<br>[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1328)   suffering. 
<br>[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1329)   Because it's always like you get pain and suffering. 
<br>[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1334)   Oh, I shouldn't put this on the internet. 
<br>[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1336)   Someone will actually think of this. 
<br>[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1338)   OK, hey, you're a Buddhist, right? 
<br>[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1340)   So we're only going to give you half as much, because you just got the pain. 
<br>[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1344)   You didn't have the suffering. 
<br>[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1346)   I can be meditative. 
<br>[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1347)   So you can see it. 
<br>[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1352)   So all my life, until I started to meditate, it's like, well, as soon as I have pain, I 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1360)   have suffering. 
<br>[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1361)   They're the same thing. 
<br>[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1362)   And that's why the lawyers ask for pain and suffering if you've had a tort. 
<br>[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1369)   But now I can see it's like, OK, the pain is one thing, and my mental judgments about 
<br>[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1377)   it are quite a different thing, and the way my body tightens around it is yet a completely 
<br>[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1383)   different thing. 
<br>[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1384)   And oh, yeah, we can relax that tightening, and we can let go of those judgments. 
<br>[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1390)   And then it's like, does it hurt? 
<br>[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1392)   Yes, but it's just not the same. 
<br>[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1394)   That discrimination, that was worth every moment of what I had to go through. 
<br>[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1403)   Because otherwise, I never would have known. 
<br>[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1406)   Who would have thunk it? 
<br>[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1409)   Pain is one thing. 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1411)   The suffering is something else. 
<br>[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1413)   The resistance to the pain is a completely different thing. 
<br>[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1418)   And when the two come together, you have suffering. 
<br>[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1421)   So that's the nature of suffering. 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1425)   And then when there's just the pain, without this other stuff, there's less suffering. 
<br>[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1431)   And then I extrapolate it. 
<br>[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1433)   It's like, OK, if diminishing the resistance somewhat causes the suffering to diminish 
<br>[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1442)   somewhat, then where will this lead? 
<br>[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1446)   Well, it is theoretically possible that there could be zero resistance, and therefore no 
<br>[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1452)   suffering at all. 
<br>[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1454)   And that would apply both to emotional pain and physical pain. 
<br>[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1460)   So if I only got that one insight in my entire meditation career, it would still be worth 
<br>[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1467)   the price and admission. 
<br>[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1469)   Because otherwise, I would have had to live my life without knowing. 
<br>[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1473)   Oh my god, how does anyone live their life without knowing that? 
<br>[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1478)   You've got this sort of Damocles hanging over your head. 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1483)   It can fall down any time. 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1486)   So there's the suffering nature, which I think has maybe not everything that the Buddhist 
<br>[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1501)   tradition says about that is valid. 
<br>[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1503)   But I think plenty of it is when you analyze. 
<br>[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1507)   There's the suffering nature, and then there's the nature of suffering, which is a very, 
<br>[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1514)   very useful insight. 
<br>[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1517)   Anicca. 
<br>[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1518)   I'm sorry, dukkha. 
<br>[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1520)   OK, anicca, impermanence. 
<br>[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1522)   What about that? 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1524)   Well, that's pretty evident, that things don't last. 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1534)   And if we pin 100% of our happiness on things that aren't going to last, then we are definitely 
<br>[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1543)   setting ourselves up for suffering. 
<br>[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1550)   What else is there to say about that? 
<br>[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1552)   Well, a couple things, actually. 
<br>[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1559)   One of the criticisms of Buddhism is that, well, because it encourages people to become 
<br>[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1567)   indifferent to circumstances, objective circumstances, because it's all impermanent. 
<br>[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1575)   So why bother? 
<br>[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1578)   Why care? 
<br>[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1580)   And it doesn't help that the early Buddhist lifestyle was one of renouncing the society 
<br>[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1590)   and going off and living a sannyasi life. 
<br>[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1597)   That means you know, when I became a Buddhist monk in Japan, there's quite a little ceremony 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1607)   that you do. 
<br>[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1609)   You, well, I haven't thought about this for a long time. 
<br>[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1620)   What was it? 
<br>[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1621)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1626)   Kokuro, fumo, kokuro, uchida. 
<br>[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1632)   Just remembering in Japanese. 
<br>[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1634)   So they shave most of your head except for a little piece that they leave, and I get 
<br>[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1644)   shaved at the ceremony. 
<br>[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1646)   Okay, so symbolically that's the last thing. 
<br>[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1649)   And you put on robes for the first time. 
<br>[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1652)   I haven't thought about this for a long time. 
<br>[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1658)   This is like 1970. 
<br>[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1660)   So the robes have really long sleeves, and I, so they put these robes on you, you know, 
<br>[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1673)   you complete the ceremony, you get the last little piece of hair is cut off, and then 
<br>[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1680)   you have to go like to this shrine area and chant some mantras and things. 
<br>[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1686)   And so I like walked out the door, right, and the first thing I did was catch that sleeve 
<br>[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1693)   on a post and rip it. 
<br>[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1696)   Okay, this is mindfulness clothes I've got on. 
<br>[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1703)   These clothes are designed to make you pay very close attention. 
<br>[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1708)   You know, just like as a Buddhist monk. 
<br>[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1713)   But what I was remembering was that just before they cut off that last hair thing, there are 
<br>[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1722)   three kakemono. 
<br>[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1724)   Kakemono in Japanese are those scrolls that hang, you know, or like long rectangular pieces 
<br>[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1733)   of paper. 
<br>[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1734)   And you have to bow to each one three times to say goodbye, goodbye forever. 
<br>[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1744)   And the first one says Fumo, Fumo, right, father and mother. 
<br>[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1754)   And the second one says Kokuro, Kokuro. 
<br>[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1759)   The king of the country or the ruler of the country. 
<br>[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1766)   And the third one says Uchidami in Japanese. 
<br>[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1771)   Chinese that would be Jashan, your family gods. 
<br>[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1777)   And you say goodbye. 
<br>[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1779)   That represents all of traditional society of ancient times in Asia. 
<br>[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1786)   You say goodbye to that because now you're in a completely, you are Chuja, you have left 
<br>[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1793)   Chuke, you have left it all. 
<br>[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1797)   That's called sannyasa in Sanskrit. 
<br>[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1800)   So that was the system that was set up in India because India is a very stereotyped 
<br>[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1811)   society and has had, had and still has very stereotyped roles. 
<br>[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1818)   So if you wanted to be a transcendent specialist, there's good news. 
<br>[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1824)   You can. 
<br>[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1825)   The society will support you, but you have to shave your head and wear the robes of a 
<br>[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1831)   criminal. 
<br>[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1832)   You know, the orange jumpsuits, the criminals. 
<br>[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1835)   It's the same thing in India. 
<br>[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1837)   You're just out of the pale of society. 
<br>[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1841)   You're just a whole different thing. 
<br>[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1846)   So because there is that social model in Buddhism, you can see why people, and then because there's 
<br>[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1856)   this notion, okay, everything's impermanent, so Buddhism must teach people that, to be 
<br>[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1864)   indifferent to circumstances and the needs of society. 
<br>[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1870)   I'm criticizing to, in order to answer the critics, okay. 
<br>[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1875)   This is the stuff that you see on the internet, anti, the things that people that don't like 
<br>[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1880)   Buddhism, this is the kind of things that they say about it. 
<br>[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1885)   It's like, because it teaches everything is, any compounded thing is impermanent, so the 
<br>[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1899)   implication is, why bother about compounded things? 
<br>[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1902)   And besides, it's sort of the proof of that is these social structure of early Buddhism, 
<br>[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1909)   which was just say goodbye to the world. 
<br>[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1914)   Now just because India at that time had a certain social structure, and that worked 
<br>[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1922)   for the Buddha, does not mean there is anything intrinsic in the notion of impermanence that 
<br>[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1931)   says we should be indifferent to circumstances. 
<br>[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1938)   It just says that we should not pin 100% of our happiness on circumstances, which I think 
<br>[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1947)   is very reasonable. 
<br>[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1950)   We should allocate a certain amount of time and energy towards exploring happiness that 
<br>[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1958)   is not dependent on something that is impermanent. 
<br>[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1964)   And unfortunately, that form of happiness actually does exist. 
<br>[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1972)   You often see a confusion between detachment or indifference with regards to the object 
<br>[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1985)   of world, and detachment or, I wouldn't even say indifference, I would just say, people 
<br>[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1995)   confuse that with what I call equanimity. 
<br>[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=1999)   And so my concept of equanimity is designed to answer the critics, and also to clarify 
<br>[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2007)   things for people that work within the Buddhist tradition. 
<br>[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2016)   The ability to let sensory experience come and go without push and pull, the ability 
<br>[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2025)   to do that, I think is a very important ability. 
<br>[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2033)   That does not mean two things. 
<br>[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2038)   It does, the ability to allow sensory experience to come and go without involvement, to take 
<br>[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2046)   a hands-off attitude with regards to the expansion and contraction of sensory experience, that 
<br>[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2054)   ability does not imply two things that some people think it implies. 
<br>[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2062)   It is a pretty radical thing, because we're not just talking about bodily sensations, 
<br>[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2070)   we're talking about mental states also. 
<br>[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2072)   The ability to allow sense and nonsense to come and go with indifference, the ability 
<br>[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2081)   to allow physical and emotional pleasure and pain to come and go with indifference with 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2087)   regards to how they expand and contract in your senses, that ability is very useful. 
<br>[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2094)   But notice I said, the ability to do that. 
<br>[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2099)   Because what people think you're saying is that you're advocating walking around all 
<br>[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2105)   the time stuck on that and that only. 
<br>[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2110)   Equanimity is an ability. 
<br>[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2114)   On demand, when it's appropriate to be able to have this hands-off attitude. 
<br>[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2120)   At other times, you can absolutely take a stand with regards to your sensory experience. 
<br>[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2129)   We do it all the time. 
<br>[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2131)   Every time we do Nurture Positive, we're saying we're selectively attending to positive content. 
<br>[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2141)   We're not just letting anything come and go. 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2144)   That's a different practice. 
<br>[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2147)   And actually, the ability to let negatives come and go in the background helps us selectively 
<br>[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2157)   attend to positive content. 
<br>[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2160)   And even to be open to that positive content informing our being, which is the Nurture 
<br>[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2168)   Positive practice. 
<br>[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2170)   So, the ability to, when it's appropriate or when you want to, to detach from sense 
<br>[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2180)   and nonsense in the mind, positive and negative thoughts, let them come and go without carrying, 
<br>[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2188)   or rather without push and pull. 
<br>[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2190)   The ability to do that, the ability to let pleasure and pain, physical and emotional 
<br>[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2194)   come and go, the ability to allow things to congeal and melt without preferences, that 
<br>[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2205)   is equanimity and that's a hugely useful skill to have. 
<br>[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2211)   But it doesn't mean that that's all you ever do just because you have that skill. 
<br>[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2216)   You can take a stand. 
<br>[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2217)   You can reject negative thoughts. 
<br>[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2220)   In fact, you can do that better if you have that skill. 
<br>[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2223)   And the other thing that it doesn't imply is that you're indifferent to external circumstances, 
<br>[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2229)   that you're going to take a hands-off attitude with regards to how your life goes or how 
<br>[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2235)   the society goes. 
<br>[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2239)   And I would claim that in fact the ability to not interfere with the way the world makes 
<br>[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2246)   you feel frees up energy to take a stand, to make the world a better place. 
<br>[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2255)   So, yes, everything in the world may be ultimately impermanent and therefore to pin your happiness 
<br>[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2268)   on it is 100% is not a good idea, but you can pin some happiness on it. 
<br>[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2276)   There's some limited predictabilities in the world. 
<br>[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2281)   But you want to have another source of happiness, one that's not dependent on impermanent things. 
<br>[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2289)   And so that's why I formulated the notion of equanimity. 
<br>[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2301)   And I always say it's a skill that's a relationship to sensory experience and should never be 
<br>[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2309)   confused with indifference to circumstances. 
<br>[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2313)   But there's a deep, deep, deep reason why people do make that confusion. 
<br>[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2319)   Because it is not easy to let, to just allow the world to impact on your mind and body 
<br>[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2332)   without interfering with that impact. 
<br>[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2335)   It seems like you're going to just die. 
<br>[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2338)   And it seems like you're going to become passive and ineffectual. 
<br>[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2346)   In other words, the sensory experience of equanimity at a deep level initially seems 
<br>[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2359)   like it's going to make you indifferent and therefore vulnerable and irresponsible. 
<br>[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2366)   And so you're afraid to have complete equanimity. 
<br>[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2371)   And it's only after you've sort of gone over that hump and you realize, no, it doesn't 
<br>[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2376)   work that way. 
<br>[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2378)   Just because I have the ability to experience the litany of horrors that is the six o'clock 
<br>[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2385)   news so fully that I don't suffer, that does not mean that I stop caring about 
<br>[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2395)   what I see on television. 
<br>[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2397)   In fact, very much the opposite. 
<br>[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2399)   But some part of us doesn't believe that until we've been over that hump. 
<br>[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2405)   And so it just holds on. 
<br>[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2408)   And it's like, no, I can't totally let this have me because then I'm going to be half. 
<br>[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2417)   So anyway, impermanence. 
<br>[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2424)   So what is it that we can have that will be a reliable source of happiness if conditioned 
<br>[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2440)   things are impermanent? 
<br>[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2443)   Well, we'll talk about that in a moment. 
<br>[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2450)   No self. 
<br>[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2458)   There's a very good reason to define enlightenment in terms of realizing no self. 
<br>[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2471)   As long as you don't get too caught up in words, because half the world calls that experience 
<br>[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2481)   the true self. 
<br>[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2484)   And if you're caught up in words, then it's like you just miss the point. 
<br>[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2490)   You can't see the liberation in people that have theistic religions or people that are 
<br>[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2498)   working within a Hindu context that are talking about realizing the true witness, the true self. 
<br>[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2506)   You can't see that the Yoga Sutras are talking about the same thing as the Buddhist sutras. 
<br>[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2512)   You can't see that because the description seems to be the diametric opposite. 
<br>[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2520)   If Buddhist enlightenment is no self and someone goes around saying self, self, self, then they 
<br>[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2528)   must be quite misguided. 
<br>[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2532)   No, they've just chosen for very legitimate reasons to call that self. 
<br>[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2541)   So I would just give that one little caveat. 
<br>[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2544)   We don't want the litmus test to be certain words. 
<br>[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2550)   We want the litmus test to be certain experiences. 
<br>[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2559)   It's been my experience that there are perhaps four different flavors of no self. 
<br>[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2573)   I like to use this inner system of mental image, mental talk, and body emotion for a 
<br>[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2584)   lot of different reasons. 
<br>[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2586)   I like to use that to analyze the experience of self as a sensory system. 
<br>[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2595)   Now, there's other ways to chop up that pot. 
<br>[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2599)   There's the five aggregates, there's the four foundations. 
<br>[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2603)   You could broadly say, well, anything mind and body is self, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2609)   But for various reasons, parsimony and a bunch of other things. 
<br>[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2614)   Oh, parsimony, that just means simplicity. 
<br>[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2620)   I like to use that system. 
<br>[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2622)   So just for now, we're going to work within that system. 
<br>[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2632)   I always like to say that the inner see, hear, feel sometimes reacts to the outer sight, 
<br>[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2639)   sound, touch. 
<br>[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2641)   Sometimes it goes off proactive, spins memory, plan, fantasy. 
<br>[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2649)   The individual elements interact with each other. 
<br>[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2653)   That's why I call it a system. 
<br>[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2656)   It's a system. 
<br>[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2658)   And then every once in a while, the interactivity just turns off. 
<br>[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2665)   Sometimes it turns off because out expands. 
<br>[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2668)   There's only a finite amount of real estate in consciousness, so out expands and in contracts. 
<br>[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2674)   And that's those famous sad stories of master enlighten me. 
<br>[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2679)   And the master says, go down! 
<br>[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2683)   The master says, see, I enlightened you. 
<br>[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2688)   The idea being for just a moment before there was the reaction. 
<br>[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2693)   If you just look back, you see the system just went offline. 
<br>[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2698)   The inner system was just swamped by the sound. 
<br>[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2701)   But it's very hard to notice that moment. 
<br>[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2704)   But if you sit and just sort of watch, either because out expands or just because the system just goes offline, 
<br>[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2714)   when the interactivity ceases, there's no sense of I. 
<br>[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2719)   And if you're looking or hearing or touching something external, 
<br>[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2725)   and that continues unbroken 30 seconds, a minute, two minutes, the inner system does not activate, 
<br>[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2733)   your identity just goes elastic and you just start inhabiting what was formerly out. 
<br>[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2740)   So that's one flavor of no self. 
<br>[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2743)   Another flavor of no self is, well, the system is activated, 
<br>[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2749)   but the components at all of their fractal scales are completely untangled. 
<br>[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2755)   Because remember, it's not just one scale of image, talk, body, emotion. 
<br>[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2761)   Inside an image is all sorts of subtle talk and body emotion. 
<br>[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2765)   And inside each one of those strands is like subtle images. 
<br>[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2772)   And so untangling this multi-scale scheme of inner senior field is no small deal. 
<br>[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2784)   But if you get them completely untangled, an emergent property called self is thing vanishes. 
<br>[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2795)   And you know I've given several metaphors for that. 
<br>[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2799)   If you have red and white thread and you just sort of tangle them together and look at it from a distance, 
<br>[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2808)   it seems to be pink. 
<br>[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2810)   But then as you get closer and look at what's actually there, 
<br>[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2814)   the emergent property, the illusory property of pinkness goes away. 
<br>[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2819)   It's just red and there's white. 
<br>[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2822)   So there's senior field, inner senior field, mental image, mental talk, body emotion, 
<br>[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2829)   particularly the self-referential stuff, but in general all of it. 
<br>[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2833)   And it's all tangled together. 
<br>[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2837)   With sensory clarity, if at all the scales, not just the surface scale, but at all the scales, 
<br>[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2844)   if you get those waveforms completely untangled and they are able to interpenetrate without interfering like soliton waves, 
<br>[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2858)   that gives you an experience of flow self that is... 
<br>[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2864)   No, no, I'm sorry, that gives you an experience of no self that's based on untangling, 
<br>[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2877)   on untangling or resolution effect. 
<br>[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2880)   And this is the classic description of no self in early Buddhism. 
<br>[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2884)   It's usually applied to the five aggregates. 
<br>[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2887)   And I've given many talks, you've heard this many times. 
<br>[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2895)   It's also done with the four great elements in early Buddhism. 
<br>[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2899)   There's this shocking description the Buddha gives of just as a skillful butcher would carve up a steer, 
<br>[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2910)   and at some point the perception steer goes away and the perception meat arises. 
<br>[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2917)   That's actually in the Buddhist scriptures. 
<br>[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2920)   Clearly they weren't vegetarian 2500 years ago, or at least some were. 
<br>[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2929)   Okay, so you chop it up and the perception, well, just to extend the metaphor, 
<br>[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2935)   the perception self goes away and the perception inner seer field clearly arises. 
<br>[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2943)   And it's not a thing called self. 
<br>[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2945)   So if we call the turning off of the inner system no self in the sense of N-O, 
<br>[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2951)   I sometimes jokingly call the no self experience that comes through fully untangling, 
<br>[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2958)   I call that no self, K-N-O-W, self. 
<br>[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2961)   You so fully have known the components that it's a no self experience. 
<br>[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2966)   Then those individual components can show you that they're vibrating super strings. 
<br>[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2978)   This of course is just a metaphor. 
<br>[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2980)   Again, I'm not saying that it's quantum physics, okay. 
<br>[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2984)   But they're sort of like vibrating super strings. 
<br>[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2987)   They are vibrating space. 
<br>[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=2995)   And sometimes the whole inner system, even if you can't untangle the strands at all the levels, 
<br>[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3007)   you get this sense that the surface activity in the inner system has sort of gone away, 
<br>[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3013)   but there's this undercurrent of shimmering on the mental screen. 
<br>[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3017)   There's this rumbling in talk space, a kind of idling in the emotional circuits. 
<br>[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3022)   There's this vibratory flow that's filling the subject in space. 
<br>[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3027)   If you sort of zoom out, cover that whole space, 
<br>[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3031)   and just sort of give permission for that inner field to shimmer, 
<br>[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3038)   that will create another flavor of insight into no self. 
<br>[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3046)   And then there is the even deeper experience of what's behind that shimmering field, 
<br>[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3058)   which is this effortless simultaneous expansion contraction that I talk about every time I talk, almost. 
<br>[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3069)   This is, Sasaki Roshi called it, Mujo no Hataraki. 
<br>[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3081)   The activity of impermanence, Kongen no Hataraki, the activity of the source. 
<br>[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3091)   Busho no Hataraki, the activity of the Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3096)   These are just all synonyms. 
<br>[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3101)   But impermanence is maybe its main name. 
<br>[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3110)   Because it's like trying to pin, it's like trying to nail tofu to the wall. 
<br>[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3118)   As soon as you think it's expansion, it's also contraction. 
<br>[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3122)   As soon as you think it's contraction, it's also expansion. 
<br>[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3126)   And it embraces. 
<br>[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3131)   It is a kind of flow of space. 
<br>[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3136)   And there can be a figure ground reversal. 
<br>[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3145)   Where you say that, well, because that's what's behind all that foam, 
<br>[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3156)   and that foam is what senior field is made of, then this is what I am. 
<br>[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3167)   And that's where the irony comes in that we finally come back and answer our question. 
<br>[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3175)   Well, if conditioned things are impermanent, so we shouldn't pin all of our happiness on that. 
<br>[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3188)   We can pin some happiness on it. 
<br>[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3190)   But we should allocate a certain amount of time and energy to finding a happiness and ordering principle that is permanent. 
<br>[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3208)   And that's where the little irony can be found. 
<br>[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3212)   Because it is the activity of impermanence that is our true birthright. 
<br>[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3224)   And since it does give us an experience of not only the inner senior field, but the outer senior field arising, co-arising. 
<br>[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3237)   Well, not only does it provide that permanent fulfillment, because even after the mind and body die, 
<br>[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3248)   to the extent that you've said, I'm not my mind and body, but I am this empty activity that is responsible for my mind and body. 
<br>[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3261)   To the extent that you've said that many, many times, thousands of times, thousands of times a day, during a lifetime, 
<br>[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3269)   to that extent, you don't die. You just side-switch. 
<br>[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3273)   You just do an end run around the passing away of your mind and body. 
<br>[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3283)   So a case could be made that therein lies a permanent source of happiness. 
<br>[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3293)   But because it's not just what molds the inner world, the inner senior field, it molds the outer senior field. 
<br>[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3305)   So it seems like you're always looking at that with which you share a womb. 
<br>[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3317)   You're looking at... the fraternity and sorority of creation are in your face constantly. 
<br>[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3329)   And so that source of personal, permanent happiness is also a constant reminder to care about other people, 
<br>[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3343)   thus totally giving the lie, totally overcoming the misconception that people that do this practice become indifferent to the plight of others. 
<br>[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iuZwivL7HY&t=3373)  . 
<br>
