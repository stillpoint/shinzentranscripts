<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=0)   Yes. 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=7)   Could you define what you mean by enlightenment in this case? 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=11)   Stream entry. 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=12)   Stream entry. Could you define that for me please? 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=14)   Long, long, long piece on the internet, on my YouTube channels. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=20)   But you would like the executive summary. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=23)   Please. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=24)   Executive summary is that you have a kind of, let's see, that you realize that there is no thing inside you called a self. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=41)   Sometimes that realization happens suddenly and you can read about that in books like Three Pillars of Zen. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=48)   They've got all these testimonials in there about people for whom it happened really suddenly. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=54)   But it's my experience that it usually sneaks up on people. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=58)   Sometimes they don't realize, quite realize how enlightened they've become because they gradually acclimatize. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=64)   But the Buddhist definition of enlightenment is that you realize that there's never been a thing inside you called a self. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=73)   Now, there is certainly an activity inside you called a personality. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=79)   And paradoxically, the more clearly you realize that there's no thing inside you called a self, 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=86)   the more freed up the wave inside you called personality becomes. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQrUx010gvI&t=92)   That would be the executive summary.
