title: "How & Why Shinzen Became a Monk"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=0)   So you were ordained a monk at Mount Koya in the Xiong'an tradition, right? 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=14)   Correct. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=15)   Is that something you always wanted to do since you were a kid? 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=18)   No, not really. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=19)   What I always wanted to do since I was a kid was be a samurai. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=27)   I saw in the 50s Japanese samurai movies when I was in middle school. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=34)   And I just got fascinated with the whole Japanese culture thing. 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=39)   And that led to my learning the Japanese language in LA, going to Japanese ethnic school in 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=46)   addition to American public school. 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=50)   And that got me to Japan in my senior year at UCLA where I was an Asian language major. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=60)   And I encountered real-life Buddhist monks, but my interest in them was just because it 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=66)   was the closest thing to ancient Japan that still exists. 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=71)   In other words, in the temples, I mean they have telephones and electricity and all that, 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=76)   but it's sort of like the old days, right? 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=79)   So I was fascinated with it. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=82)   That would be the closest that I could get. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=84)   Did they have swords? 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=85)   No, only the wisdom sword. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=91)   So I was hanging out in Buddhist temples just to sort of live as close as I could the fantasy 
<br>[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=98)   of ancient Japan. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=100)   But I wasn't meditating because that's the last thing in the world I had a proclivity 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=105)   to do. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=106)   I was scattered and impatient and wimpy and all those things. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=111)   So I was just hanging out, having fun in the temple. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=115)   But I had a sense that they knew a kind of secret that they would be willing to share, 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=121)   but they would never push on me. 
<br>[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=123)   So when I got back to the United States, I was graduating from UCLA and I thought, well, 
<br>[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=129)   I want to go to graduate school. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=131)   I want it to be related to Asia. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=133)   I'll study Buddhism because you need a lot of esoteric languages for that, and I was 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=138)   good at languages and so forth. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=140)   So I was going to become an academician, a professional scholar of Buddhism. 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=147)   I passed my prelims for a PhD at the University of Wisconsin. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=153)   So they sent me back to Japan to do research on a topic. 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=159)   I decided to pick the Shingon School of Buddhism, which is the Japanese version of Vajrayana 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=166)   practice, also known as Tantric Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism. 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=171)   I chose that because although many Westerners at that time were studying the Tibetan forms 
<br>[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=177)   of Vajrayana practice, no one knew about or was studying the practice as it had been preserved 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=185)   in Japan for a thousand years. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=187)   So I thought, okay, I'll make this my academic bailiwick, my specialty. 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=192)   I'll be the expert in the Western world on the Japanese version of Vajrayana practice. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=200)   So I went there with that in mind, with that goal. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=205)   But when I got there, they wouldn't teach me anything because it's for self-transformation, 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=212)   not just as an intellectual curiosity. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=216)   So they said the only way that I could learn it is if I was willing to become a monk and 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=223)   live in the temple. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=225)   So in order to be able to write my PhD thesis, I... 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=229)   You became a monk just so you could write your PhD thesis? 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=233)   Pretty much. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=235)   But what happened is that my motivation shifted once I started to live in the temple and once 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=243)   I started to get some instruction in the practice, I realized there was a huge potential there 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=251)   for me personally. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=253)   So they were very clever. 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=254)   They put me in this situation that turned me around. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=259)   And then something happened, something happened in my personal life that pretty much blew 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=264)   me away emotionally and pointed out to me the absolute necessity of seeing beyond the 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=275)   body and the mind. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=277)   And that happened while I was in that first year that I was a monk there in Japan. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=284)   And that just changed everything for me. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=287)   When I was in graduate school at Wisconsin, my hero was my graduate advisor. 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=293)   His name was Richard Robinson. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=296)   And he was an intellectual giant, just an intellectual giant is all I could say. 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=305)   He could make puns in three languages simultaneously. 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=309)   His specialty was Buddhist logic. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=311)   Yes, there is something called Buddhist logic. 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=315)   It's Aristotelian syllogistic logic that was used in the Madhyamaka school of Nagarjuna. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=324)   Somewhat along the lines that the Greek Zeno school and so forth used logic to sort of 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=333)   show people beyond the world. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=337)   What's beyond the world? 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=338)   Anyway, he was a master of that. 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=341)   And while I was a monk, I got this letter from the United States. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=346)   He had been injured in a bizarre and horrific accident. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=353)   A fuse blew out in his house and he went down to change it and there was no source of electricity. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=361)   So to light, he struck a match and there had been a gas leak there and it went up like 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=367)   a soccer torch and just burns all over his body and horrifically, if he had lived, he 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=375)   would have been horrifically deformed. 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=378)   He just suffered in agony for a month and then died. 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=384)   I thought to myself, what good is all that knowledge? 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=391)   What good is all that intelligence if this can happen at any time to a person? 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=399)   That made it real for me and gave me the motivation to want to see beyond the limited identity 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN8Q2lmVC3A&t=407)   with the body and the mind.
