<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=0)   So tell me about, how long have you been with Shenzhen? 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=14)   23 years. 
<br>[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=15)   My daughter was 3. 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=16)   That's how I keep track and she's 26 now. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=19)   Wow. 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=20)   So in 23 years, I'm sure you've had a lot of experience with Shenzhen's techniques. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=26)   Just off the top of your head, give me an example of how his techniques have changed 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=33)   your life. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=34)   There might be many, but just pick one. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=38)   I have to say that often, things that might have bothered me in the past, barely register 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=46)   on the scale now. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=48)   So when I talk to people about meditation, I will say it makes my tiny, tiny little things 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=58)   very beautiful or passionate or pleasant. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=67)   And then things that are huge emotionally, reduce it to something that is very manageable 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=74)   or not there at all. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=77)   But I can't imagine people living through some catastrophic things. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=83)   You know, people have terminal cancer, terminal illness, and I can't imagine my life without 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=89)   this practice to sort of even things out and give me a better perspective on the highs 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=96)   and the lows. 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=97)   All right, you wanted to add one other thing? 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=101)   I wouldn't say the most important, but for me, the understanding of impermanence has 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=113)   been a huge support, I guess, in my life. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=122)   You know, understanding that things will change, things will go away, you will lose things, 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=130)   you will gain things, and then lose them. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=133)   That to me has been a really, really helpful thing in my life, not just for losing loved 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=140)   ones, but also feeling equanimous with, well, this is the way it is today, but tomorrow, 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=147)   who knows? 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=149)   So that sort of helped me through the... 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=151)   Through acceptance. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=153)   Exactly, yeah. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=154)   And I think it rules my life a lot. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbnnurtmQ2I&t=157)   I think I probably depend on that a lot.
