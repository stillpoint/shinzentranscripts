title: "SHINZEN's PANDEMIC STRATEGIES"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=0)   One of the advantages of being 75 years old is I can say, 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=31)   in my day, such and such and such and such. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=35)   And the in my day is not just the 1960s. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=44)   The formative period for me was the 50s. 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=49)   And I was born in the 40s. 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=52)   I was born during World War II. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=56)   So I remember a very different US. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=67)   Very, very different. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=69)   And I know we look out and we see lots of problems, 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=76)   sources of frustration and so forth. 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=80)   But sure. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=88)   There's also, however, 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=91)   the extraordinary shift that has occurred 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=96)   that I never in my wildest dreams 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=101)   would have thought could occur. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=103)   The US of my formative years 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=110)   was a culture that looked eternal. 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=116)   I assumed things would be essentially the same 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=119)   when I'm 75 years old as when I was five years old. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=124)   So when I was five years old, who was President Eisenhower? 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=128)   I think so. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=135)   So that's what I thought, 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=139)   that's the way I thought it would always be. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=144)   The notion that what is essentially an import from Asia 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=152)   would fundamentally impact 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=156)   broad aspects of North American culture 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=163)   is completely off the charts. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=168)   Unthinkable that anything like that would happen. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=172)   So for me, because I compare to my youth, 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=182)   what we're doing here, what I do every day, 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=186)   what thousands of people are doing 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=188)   around the world every day with this practice, 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=193)   this is miraculous. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=195)   It's still miraculous for me. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=203)   I wanted to show you this very cool book. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=210)   I think it's a cool book now. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=213)   I thought it was monstrous when I was 15 years old. 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=221)   This book is emblematic of the way things used to be 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=229)   vis-a-vis this practice, not all that long ago. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=234)   So this book is by Ernest Becker, 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=238)   who it turns out was actually not a small figure. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=242)   He made later in his career some substantial contributions 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=250)   to the field of psychology, 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=255)   but he launched his literary career with this book, 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=260)   Zen Irrational Critique. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=264)   Based on essentially no knowledge whatsoever of Zen, 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=276)   but a desire perhaps to make a name 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=280)   or create a straw man that's easy to attack 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=286)   or what have you. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=291)   He writes this book, now let's see here. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=295)   I read this book and it devastated me when I was a teenager, 
<br>[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=300)   just devastated me. 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=303)   Let's see here, what's the date? 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=311)   1961. 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=313)   Ha ha. 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=320)   So let's see what this book says. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=326)   This is 1961, oops, sorry about that. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=331)   Without this, I won't read it. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=334)   Okay. 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=342)   The appeal of Zen to a variety of Westerners, 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=347)   both dilettantes and professionals has been increasingly 
<br>[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=351)   and to some has been increasingly evident 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=356)   and to some has become a matter of concern. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=367)   Appeal of Zen is a matter of concern in 1961. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=374)   Zen typifies an Eastern approach to problem solving 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=378)   that is the opposite pole of Western ideals. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=383)   The human being puppet-like manipulates himself 
<br>[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=386)   in the hope of coercing his environment 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=388)   steeped in a tradition of magical omnipotence. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=392)   The Zenist seeks to bring other worldly power 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=395)   to bear upon this worldly problems. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=399)   To this question, does Zen hold forth anything of value 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=404)   to the West? 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=405)   This book makes an unremitting negative answer and it goes on 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=415)   and on and on and on about how the practice that we do 
<br>[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=422)   is essentially a form of mental illness. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=426)   So this is a book written by a doctor 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=436)   and doctors have authority. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=441)   And this was a book written before these kinds 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=445)   of practices were widespread. 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=447)   So I'm 15 years old, I picked this thing up, 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=457)   or however old I am, I was young. 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=463)   And it's like, oh my God, 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=468)   all this stuff I'm interested in is all bullshit. 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=472)   Why? 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=473)   A doctor says so. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=475)   It took me a long time to recover from that. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=483)   That's why I love this so much now 
<br>[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=485)   because of the sweet revenge. 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=489)   Okay, the sweet revenge. 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=493)   We who are but of yesterday are now in all your therapy 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=498)   rooms and your board rooms and your military training camps 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=503)   and you name it. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=506)   So big shift really, 
<br>[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=514)   the notion that not only is this not superstition, 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=519)   magic and complete world denying nonsense, 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=527)   not only is it not that which people said it was 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=531)   in my lifetime, important people, 
<br>[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=536)   turns out that there's a natural complementarity, 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=543)   a kind of natural co-evolution 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=548)   where the strengths of modern science 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=551)   and the strengths of contemplative practice 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=554)   can reinforce each other. 
<br>[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=557)   And the weaknesses and dangers in each 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=567)   can perhaps be ameliorated 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=575)   and managed by the influence of the other. 
<br>[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=580)   So yesterday I outlined four concepts. 
<br>[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=589)   And if you know how to unpack these concepts, 
<br>[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=597)   you'll have a sense of what a science 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=602)   informed contemplative based psycho-spiritual path 
<br>[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=609)   can look like. 
<br>[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=610)   So you'll recall, develop the skills, 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=615)   optimize the happy. 
<br>[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=623)   So I'm gonna go through these four concepts 
<br>[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=628)   and we talked about techniques 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=638)   and you get a lot of instruction in technique, 
<br>[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=644)   but we also talked about the training structure 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=651)   wherein those techniques are implemented. 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=654)   Retreat practice, life practice, 
<br>[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=658)   get support, give support. 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=660)   We harp on these structures, 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=663)   establishing and maintaining them for the lifetime 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=670)   to at least a minimal degree. 
<br>[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=674)   We talked about that. 
<br>[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=676)   Another part that I alluded to, 
<br>[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=681)   but I'd like to just fill out a little more detail 
<br>[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=686)   is the accelerators. 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=690)   So you have to have the pillars. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=691)   Without the pillars, you're not gonna have a practice. 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=695)   People will say, okay, well, 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=697)   are there things that can help speed it along? 
<br>[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=703)   The practice, the progress, and yes, I would say so. 
<br>[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=708)   We talk about this all the time, 
<br>[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=713)   but I just wanted to mention it within the context 
<br>[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=716)   of the online retreat that we're now doing. 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=722)   So one of the accelerators is, 
<br>[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=730)   you could call it duration training, 
<br>[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=732)   strong determination set, Adipthana, Yuzha. 
<br>[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=737)   Sometimes we call it heroic sitting. 
<br>[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=740)   So extending the duration of your sit in a gentle way, 
<br>[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=751)   but understanding that eventually every one of us 
<br>[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=755)   will have sits with no bell. 
<br>[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=760)   I mean, guaranteed at the end of life, 
<br>[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=763)   but also stuff happens. 
<br>[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=767)   Where you just are sort of at the end of your rope. 
<br>[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=774)   It's gonna happen. 
<br>[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=775)   Circumstances will arise. 
<br>[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=780)   And knowing that there is an ordering principle 
<br>[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=785)   that is so primordial that it can never be disordered, 
<br>[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=798)   no matter what state arises in mind, body, and outer world 
<br>[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=805)   in terms of sensory impact. 
<br>[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=809)   You can still be ordered. 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=811)   You can still be okay. 
<br>[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=812)   It may not be a human ordering, 
<br>[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=815)   but it is an ordering principle that we can abide in 
<br>[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=820)   and merge with that connects us to everything. 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=827)   And one of the ways that we learn about that 
<br>[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=834)   is by sitting as though we weren't going to get up. 
<br>[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=838)   It's a kind of attitude. 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=844)   Of course we're gonna get up, but each sit, 
<br>[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=851)   at least the way my teachers taught me, 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=856)   each sit should be like, I'm not gonna get up. 
<br>[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=860)   What if there's no bell? 
<br>[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=863)   That's how I should be sitting now. 
<br>[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=865)   So you're always aiming at finding happiness 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=873)   independent of conditions 
<br>[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=874)   at the most industrial strength level. 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=878)   So one way to learn about that, 
<br>[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=886)   you don't wanna damage the body. 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=888)   I've written and spoken quite a bit about this. 
<br>[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=891)   You can read about it or talk to the coaches, 
<br>[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=894)   facilitators and so forth, 
<br>[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=896)   but no, you don't damage the body, 
<br>[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=899)   but you push the envelope with sensations. 
<br>[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=903)   And if you have a situation 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=905)   where sitting is not good for you, 
<br>[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=908)   objectively, there's all sorts of other postures 
<br>[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=911)   you can hold this Qi Gong stuff, 
<br>[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=914)   where you hold your arms out, up, you squat. 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=918)   These are standard famous practices done all over China. 
<br>[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=924)   To this day, doesn't necessarily have to be 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=927)   that the posture that you break through is a seated one, 
<br>[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=930)   because sometimes our bodies can be damaged 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=934)   by very long sets, 
<br>[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=936)   but these other postures are innocuous, 
<br>[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=940)   although they can be very intense. 
<br>[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=942)   So extending the duration 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=946)   and also extending the duration of a period of practice 
<br>[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=952)   does not necessarily have to be seated. 
<br>[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=956)   I used to sometimes do a six hour practice periods 
<br>[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=962)   without a scintilla of motion, 
<br>[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=966)   but I would do them lying down. 
<br>[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=969)   I'd get very comfortable. 
<br>[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=972)   In fact, very comfortable, 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=974)   like under the blankie, 
<br>[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=977)   and, but I drink a lot of espresso before, 
<br>[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=981)   so I'd be sure to easily stay awake. 
<br>[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=986)   And then I would relax into a corpse posture 
<br>[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=990)   that was as corpse-like still as I could muster, 
<br>[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=997)   and then just try two, three, four, five, six hours, 
<br>[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1001)   just not move a muscle, and just work through that duration. 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1011)   So it doesn't necessarily have to be, 
<br>[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1013)   duration training is not necessarily 
<br>[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1016)   about dealing with discomforts. 
<br>[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1018)   It's about extending how long you can maintain quality, 
<br>[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1025)   unbroken formal practice 
<br>[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1028)   through various kinds of situations. 
<br>[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1031)   So here in this situation, 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1038)   we can still do that, 
<br>[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1040)   and you have the convenience of your own home 
<br>[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1047)   so that you can decide, 
<br>[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1048)   am I gonna do a two hour block? 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1051)   Gonna do a four hour block, you know, before dinner, et cetera 
<br>[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1056)   and other people will be in the Zendo. 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1061)   Now, when we have these things live, 
<br>[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1065)   Cho, I actually have a question to you. 
<br>[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1068)   I was just, when I was thinking about this talk, 
<br>[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1072)   you know, at the retreats, 
<br>[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1074)   we have people designate themselves as Yusa, 
<br>[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1079)   sort of heroes, you know, that, 
<br>[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1081)   okay, I'm gonna do this four hour block every day 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1084)   or something like that. 
<br>[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1086)   I'm wondering maybe we could set something like that up. 
<br>[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1091)   Yeah, we never translated that, 
<br>[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1093)   but we do have virtual sit leaders 
<br>[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1098)   doing half day shifts. 
<br>[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1100)   So sort of their Yusa, you know, like this afternoon, 
<br>[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1104)   Nekoya started at three and she finishes at 10. 
<br>[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1108)   So it's sort of. 
<br>[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1110)   Sort of that. 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1112)   Yeah, it was just a thought that occurred to me. 
<br>[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1115)   Someone could say. 
<br>[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1116)   We'll translate that. 
<br>[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1118)   Today, you know, it's maybe under their picture 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1122)   or something and it's like, this is a four hour, you know, 
<br>[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1127)   set and then other people who would be joining that set 
<br>[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1132)   might have that inspiration in front of them, et cetera. 
<br>[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1135)   Like we do in the physical retreats. 
<br>[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1137)   I don't know, this is just a straight thought 
<br>[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1139)   that occurred to me as I was thinking about 
<br>[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1143)   things that might be helpful at the retreat. 
<br>[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1146)   Okay. 
<br>[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1147)   So that's a way of pushing the envelope, duration training. 
<br>[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1155)   Then there's trigger practice where you expose yourself 
<br>[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1158)   to sights and sounds and touches that may create states 
<br>[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1165)   and then you apply a technique. 
<br>[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1167)   The technique doesn't have to be a turn towards a technique. 
<br>[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1170)   It doesn't have to be focused in necessarily. 
<br>[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1173)   It could be any technique. 
<br>[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1176)   So I'm thinking in the practice at home situation 
<br>[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1182)   that we're in now, there's also a lot of dimensions 
<br>[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1189)   and directions where you could set up trigger practice. 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1195)   It might be actually more diversity and flexibility 
<br>[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1200)   in the home situation. 
<br>[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1203)   So once again, just something to consider 
<br>[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1207)   if you have questions, 
<br>[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1208)   but if you don't know what we mean by trigger practice, 
<br>[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1211)   once again, the teaching staff will explain that to you. 
<br>[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1217)   So I'm thinking we can incorporate that 
<br>[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1220)   into the online retreats in maybe some imaginative ways. 
<br>[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1225)   And then maybe we'd get some reports on how that worked. 
<br>[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1231)   Most specifically, motion challenge sequence. 
<br>[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1238)   Usually at retreats, this takes the form 
<br>[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1242)   of just walking practice or maybe the save a time. 
<br>[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1247)   Of just walking practice or maybe the save a tasks 
<br>[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1256)   that are done at retreats. 
<br>[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1259)   But in your home, you have once again, 
<br>[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1263)   a wider range of ordinary life activities 
<br>[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1268)   that you can attempt to stay deep with a technique 
<br>[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1273)   whilst engaging. 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1277)   So yeah, you can walk around, 
<br>[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1282)   but you could walk around in different places. 
<br>[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1284)   You can walk in your backyard, 
<br>[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1286)   but maybe you walk through the neighborhood. 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1290)   That's a different experience, 
<br>[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1293)   but also you can putter around the house. 
<br>[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1296)   You can really do Chan, Zen style, 
<br>[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1301)   Karma yoga kinds of things. 
<br>[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1303)   Try washing the dishes, try sweeping the yard, 
<br>[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1307)   try even cooking a meal maybe. 
<br>[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1312)   Maintaining a certain technique with a certain goal in mind. 
<br>[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1318)   So once again, I think it will be interesting 
<br>[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1321)   to explore the broader opportunities for motion challenge. 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1333)   Here's another thing. 
<br>[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1334)   This is a little bit on the more esoteric side, 
<br>[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1338)   but some of you are familiar with the auto speak. 
<br>[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1345)   We often do it in a very stereotyped way 
<br>[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1350)   in the form of auto chant in the retreats, 
<br>[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1354)   the residential retreats, 
<br>[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1355)   but auto speak has, if you're familiar with it, 
<br>[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1359)   you know that it has more interesting forms of practice. 
<br>[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1367)   For example, you can arrange with another person 
<br>[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1374)   to practice speaking from an unfixated place. 
<br>[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1379)   They know that you might be a little awkward 
<br>[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1381)   because you're trying to let it self-organize. 
<br>[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1384)   So you speak from auto, 
<br>[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1387)   but actually have a human conversation. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1391)   Then they speak from auto. 
<br>[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1394)   You could do that with another person at the retreat 
<br>[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1397)   or with someone over the phone, et cetera. 
<br>[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1402)   So once again, there are possibilities 
<br>[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1406)   for other ways of practicing 
<br>[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1410)   that we don't have so conveniently 
<br>[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1414)   in the residential situation. 
<br>[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1417)   So trigger practice, duration training, 
<br>[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1422)   motion challenge sequence. 
<br>[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1424)   And then the final accelerator 
<br>[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1428)   is not actually like those other three. 
<br>[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1431)   It's an attitude thing, 
<br>[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1434)   but it's very important. 
<br>[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1436)   It's an attitude about situations. 
<br>[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1443)   So one aspect of happiness is getting situations 
<br>[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1450)   to be the way we would like them to be. 
<br>[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1453)   In fact, that's the first item on the happiness grid 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1458)   because that's the first thing most people think about. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1463)   If there's a situation I don't want, 
<br>[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1469)   let's change that situation, get rid of it. 
<br>[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1472)   If there's a situation I do want, 
<br>[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1474)   let's do what we need to do to make that happen. 
<br>[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1478)   This practice is very relevant to situational happiness 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1483)   because of the general principle, 
<br>[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1485)   what goes around comes around. 
<br>[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1487)   If we act effectively as the result 
<br>[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1491)   of having done this practice, 
<br>[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1493)   then there's not the guarantee, 
<br>[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1495)   but there's the higher likelihood 
<br>[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1497)   and indeed the strong statistical force 
<br>[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1502)   that in the long run, 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1505)   we're part of the force, 
<br>[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1512)   the better angels of this planet. 
<br>[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1515)   So we want to act effectively 
<br>[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1526)   and certainly not be indifferent to situations. 
<br>[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1532)   But situation practice as an accelerator 
<br>[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1537)   is a little different aspect of it. 
<br>[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1541)   It encompasses our actions for the situation, 
<br>[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1550)   but it's a broader framework. 
<br>[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1553)   The broader framework is broadly speaking, 
<br>[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1556)   how am I going to use this situation 
<br>[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1564)   as an expression of my practice? 
<br>[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1567)   So if by situation, 
<br>[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1574)   I mean various levels of scale. 
<br>[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1581)   So a situation can be very private, very individual. 
<br>[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1585)   What's happening with my boil today 
<br>[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1594)   that I have on my leg, 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1595)   that's a situation, a very local situation. 
<br>[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1599)   Then there's this person in my life 
<br>[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1602)   or that thing in my career. 
<br>[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1604)   And then there's what's happening in the neighborhood, 
<br>[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1606)   what's happening in the country, 
<br>[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1608)   what's happening in the world, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1611)   All of the above are situations, 
<br>[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1614)   various scales of situations. 
<br>[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1617)   So if we approach each situation 
<br>[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1622)   with a clear strategy for how we want to grow with this, 
<br>[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1637)   how we're going to use this as an expression of practice, 
<br>[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1645)   essentially that monasticizes life. 
<br>[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1649)   You might say that one of the reasons 
<br>[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1654)   in the old days, people went off to monasteries 
<br>[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1657)   and actually they still do even nowadays, 
<br>[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1660)   although it's not nearly as prevalent as it was at one time. 
<br>[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1665)   At one time, East and West, 
<br>[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1668)   the cultures were completely monastic. 
<br>[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1670)   Now, definitely not that, 
<br>[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1673)   but one of the reasons people go to monasteries 
<br>[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1678)   is not to get away from things, 
<br>[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1681)   but to be forced to confront things. 
<br>[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1693)   So the householders practice 
<br>[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1698)   where we're not off in a monastery, 
<br>[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1709)   what monasticizes the day, 
<br>[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1712)   what turns the householders life into a monastic effect 
<br>[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1719)   among other things, one important thing is, 
<br>[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1723)   okay, sure, this is good, this is bad, we need to do this. 
<br>[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1731)   We should have done that, all of that. 
<br>[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1738)   But also, how am I using this situation 
<br>[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1743)   to optimize my ability to be part of the solution 
<br>[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1754)   and take measures, and we do have to take measures 
<br>[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1763)   because it's very, very easy to fall into the problem 
<br>[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1767)   of becoming part of the problem 
<br>[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1769)   by the way that we try to solve the problem. 
<br>[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1774)   It happens over and over and over again. 
<br>[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1778)   So thinking about situations of all types and all scales, 
<br>[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1787)   as they come up for us, having some sense of, 
<br>[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1793)   okay, here's how the practice relates, 
<br>[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1798)   here's how the practice relates. 
<br>[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1800)   This monasticizes the householders life. 
<br>[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1806)   So these are the accelerators. 
<br>[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1810)   So if you establish the pillars 
<br>[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1815)   and then you strengthen things with the accelerators, 
<br>[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1820)   then we're going to be in good shape, big picture wise. 
<br>[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1831)   So that was some of the sort of logistical things 
<br>[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1838)   that are practical things 
<br>[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1841)   that I wanted to make sure we covered. 
<br>[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1845)   I thought it might be fun to have a little bit of poetry 
<br>[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1856)   in addition to my sort of highly organized prose 
<br>[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1866)   with so many charts and so forth. 
<br>[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1869)   So I, hold it just a second, I have an actual printed book, 
<br>[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1881)   the collected poems of T.S. Eliot, says 1909 to 1962. 
<br>[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1891)   So I didn't really prepare. 
<br>[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1895)   Let me see if I can find something. 
<br>[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1900)   There we go. 
<br>[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1903)   That might be an interesting place to start. 
<br>[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1906)   So I don't know much about the field of poetry, 
<br>[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1930)   but I've had a lifelong fascination 
<br>[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1935)   with one poet and not just any poet, 
<br>[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1944)   but the poet universally thought of 
<br>[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1950)   as the creator of modern English poetry. 
<br>[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1955)   So 20th century, which is where I lived mostly, 
<br>[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1960)   20th century was English poetry was dominated by T.S. Eliot. 
<br>[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1967)   And I think for good reason, 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1970)   I'm not gonna give you a lecture on English literature, 
<br>[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1976)   but I think there's good reason for that. 
<br>[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1979)   You may mostly know Eliot from his dramatic works, 
<br>[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1990)   Murder in the Cathedral is one, but also Cats. 
<br>[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=1998)   I'm pretty sure that the big Broadway hit show Cats 
<br>[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2004)   is based on a work by Eliot. 
<br>[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2007)   So he did things in the drama area, 
<br>[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2011)   particularly later in life, 
<br>[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2014)   and was also influential in the theory of literary criticism 
<br>[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2019)   in the 20th century. 
<br>[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2023)   But it's his poetry that mostly attracts me 
<br>[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2029)   because his last statement, 
<br>[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2034)   at least the way I look upon it, 
<br>[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2040)   he wrote many other poems, 
<br>[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2041)   but I think if we look at the arc 
<br>[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2046)   of this person's development, 
<br>[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2050)   where he started and where he ended with his poetry, 
<br>[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2056)   it's really emblematic of the zeitgeist 
<br>[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2061)   or the spirit of the Western world in the 20th century. 
<br>[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2067)   That's quite extraordinary, really. 
<br>[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2070)   So where he ended, most of you know this, 
<br>[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2074)   maybe all of you know this because I use it a lot, 
<br>[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2079)   where he ended was the Four Quartets, 
<br>[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2082)   which is many things as the name implies. 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2087)   It's more than four voices. 
<br>[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2089)   And each of the four sections has many subsections. 
<br>[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2095)   So there are many, many things in that poem. 
<br>[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2101)   But the most important voice, the deepest voice, 
<br>[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2107)   and the voice that hardly any of the literary critics 
<br>[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2111)   who gave him a Nobel Prize for literature in 1948 even heard. 
<br>[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2116)   They didn't even hear the really important voice 
<br>[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2123)   in the Four Quartets. 
<br>[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2125)   The really important voice is, 
<br>[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2129)   the Four Quartets is a East-West, mostly West, 
<br>[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2134)   East-West, mostly West, poetic manual for the awkward, 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2144)   intermediate zone in contemplative practice. 
<br>[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2152)   There can be actually many awkward intermediate stages 
<br>[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2159)   that we go through. 
<br>[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2161)   In fact, that's one way to look at 
<br>[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2165)   what a lifetime of practice is. 
<br>[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2168)   One, a climatization after another, after another, 
<br>[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2176)   from an in-between zone that was not enough 
<br>[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2180)   in the sense that the old coping mechanism 
<br>[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2192)   that sort of works could be epitomized, 
<br>[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2197)   characterized by the phrase, tighten up and turn away. 
<br>[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2203)   The new coping mechanism that this practice gives us 
<br>[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2206)   could be described as open up and turn towards. 
<br>[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2209)   You can see these are diametric opposites. 
<br>[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2213)   So it's difficult to avoid awkward intermediate steps 
<br>[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2221)   where the old coping mechanism has been somewhat shed, 
<br>[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2226)   but the new coping mechanism is not mature enough 
<br>[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2232)   to fully deal with the slings and arrows 
<br>[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2237)   of outrageous fortune that come to us 
<br>[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2241)   from the outer world and the percolations of poison 
<br>[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2246)   and pain that well up from the inner. 
<br>[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2250)   So there can be awkward intermediate stages 
<br>[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2255)   that we have to go through in terms of emotions, 
<br>[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2260)   but also in terms of what I call integration. 
<br>[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2267)   This is just a term that I've been using recently 
<br>[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2272)   for something specific. 
<br>[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2275)   I mean, obviously this whole path is integration, 
<br>[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2280)   but specifically how do we integrate nothingness, no self, 
<br>[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2292)   emptiness, borderless, decentered being? 
<br>[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2303)   How do we integrate that into something 
<br>[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2307)   that is humanly fulfilling 
<br>[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2314)   and objectively admirable in the world? 
<br>[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2321)   How do you integrate? 
<br>[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2324)   How do you use nothing in the service of everything? 
<br>[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2333)   It would seem like nothing would be 
<br>[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2335)   in the service of nothing. 
<br>[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2337)   It would seem if the goal of this practice 
<br>[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2342)   is no self and emptiness, 
<br>[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2344)   that this practice is not a good idea. 
<br>[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2348)   Who wants that? 
<br>[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2349)   And yet we know counterintuitively all over the world, 
<br>[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2354)   East, West, ancient and modern, 
<br>[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2357)   often without any mutual contact, 
<br>[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2360)   the people that have followed this path 
<br>[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2364)   have come to talk about a very special kind of nothing. 
<br>[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2370)   So how is that in service of, 
<br>[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2375)   how is the one nothing in service of the 10,000 somethings 
<br>[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2379)   we need to take care of as a human being, 
<br>[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2383)   integrating the void into a fulfilling 
<br>[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2388)   and effective human manifestation? 
<br>[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2393)   Some people can do it without any difficulty at all. 
<br>[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2397)   It just happens. 
<br>[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2399)   They drink the void and it more or less cures their ills. 
<br>[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2404)   And they don't need any integration training. 
<br>[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2408)   Other people need integration training. 
<br>[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2412)   They need some help, some guidelines. 
<br>[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2416)   It's one of the reasons why we give you the, 
<br>[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2419)   the feel great family right at the beginning, 
<br>[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2424)   feel res, feel flow, feel bounce, feel good. 
<br>[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2427)   These are all useful for integrating emptiness 
<br>[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2434)   down the line. 
<br>[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2436)   So in any event, 
<br>[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2439)   the four quartets, 
<br>[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2446)   the last one starts midwinter spring is its own season. 
<br>[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2453)   So midwinter spring, right? 
<br>[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2456)   In between. 
<br>[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2459)   Midwinter spring is its own season. 
<br>[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2463)   Sempiternal, though sodden towards sundown, 
<br>[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2468)   suspended in time between pole and tropic. 
<br>[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2478)   Midwinter spring is its own season. 
<br>[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2481)   So time, but an in between time, 
<br>[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2486)   in between summer and, 
<br>[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2490)   I'm sorry, in between winter and spring. 
<br>[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2493)   But there's also the in between time 
<br>[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2499)   between the winter of humanity's childhood 
<br>[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2506)   and the spring and summer of what I believe 
<br>[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2510)   will be our maturity, our adulthood as a species. 
<br>[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2515)   And Eliot was a conservative Christian theologically. 
<br>[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2525)   So he had a view of history, 
<br>[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2532)   which is that at some point in the future, 
<br>[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2535)   history is gonna take care of itself. 
<br>[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2538)   That would also be the summer, the second coming. 
<br>[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2546)   I believe he was well beyond the mythological version 
<br>[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2552)   of Christianity, but that's neither here nor there. 
<br>[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2557)   Midwinter spring could be the individual practitioners state 
<br>[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2574)   of gone halfway with this practice. 
<br>[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2579)   It could be humanity's state of gone halfway 
<br>[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2584)   to what we're supposed to be, 
<br>[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2588)   either from a purely scientific Darwinian point of view, 
<br>[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2594)   or hey, if you wanna sort of go archetypal like Eliot, 
<br>[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2599)   link it to a religion, fine. 
<br>[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2604)   And of course, and there's the mid, 
<br>[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2608)   just the season between, 
<br>[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2611)   he's describing the countryside in England 
<br>[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2614)   at a certain time of year. 
<br>[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2619)   Hold it just a second. 
<br>[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2620)   That actually wasn't the poem I was gonna read, 
<br>[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2622)   but since I started it, I better find it. 
<br>[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2627)   Little Gidding, Yipes 200, okay. 
<br>[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2633)   Oh, opened right to it. 
<br>[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2638)   Maybe I can read this. 
<br>[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2639)   Midwinter spring is its own season. 
<br>[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2646)   Sempiternal, those sodden towards sundown. 
<br>[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2651)   What does that mean? 
<br>[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2652)   Sempiternal is not a common word. 
<br>[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2655)   You might've heard it. 
<br>[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2659)   It means what it sounds like. 
<br>[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2661)   It seems as though it's going to last forever. 
<br>[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2664)   It's half eternal. 
<br>[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2666)   So, sempiternal, seeming to last all day or forever, 
<br>[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2673)   yet sodden towards sundown. 
<br>[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2677)   But at the end of the day, 
<br>[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2680)   we're back to the wet of winter. 
<br>[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2684)   So, a day that could seem to last forever, 
<br>[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2689)   but really is impermanent. 
<br>[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2695)   Suspended in time, this is a great line. 
<br>[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2699)   Suspended in time between pole and tropic. 
<br>[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2707)   He's mixing time and space, isn't he? 
<br>[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2711)   He's treating space-time as one thing, 
<br>[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2714)   the same way Einstein did. 
<br>[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2716)   I have no idea if he knew that that was the case, 
<br>[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2725)   if it's just a coincidence. 
<br>[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2728)   Maybe he knew something about general relativity. 
<br>[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2731)   It certainly was in the air at that time. 
<br>[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2737)   Suspended in time between pole and tropic. 
<br>[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2740)   So, the polar regions are cold, 
<br>[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2743)   the tropical regions are warm. 
<br>[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2748)   So, you have the warm and the cold. 
<br>[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2752)   So, the time and place are being completely woven together, 
<br>[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2765)   space-time as a single thing. 
<br>[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2769)   To be both appreciated and transcended, actually. 
<br>[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2779)   Midwinter spring is its own season. 
<br>[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2783)   Sempiternal, though sodden towards sundown. 
<br>[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2788)   Suspended in time between pole and tropic. 
<br>[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2794)   When the short day is brightest with frost and fire, 
<br>[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2801)   the brief sun flames the ice on pond and ditches. 
<br>[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2807)   In windless cold, that is the heart's heat, 
<br>[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2814)   reflecting in a watery mirror, 
<br>[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2819)   a glare that is blindness in the early afternoon. 
<br>[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2826)   Sorry, I sometimes lose my composure a little bit. 
<br>[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2831)   A glare that is blindness in the early afternoon. 
<br>[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2837)   What is the early afternoon here? 
<br>[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2842)   What is the glare that is blindness? 
<br>[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2846)   Well, on one hand, it's just the sun doing its thing 
<br>[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2855)   at this time of year. 
<br>[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2858)   But there's these weird words, 
<br>[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2864)   windless cold, that is the heart's heat, 
<br>[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2868)   reflecting in a watery mirror, 
<br>[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2871)   a glare that is blindness in the early afternoon. 
<br>[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2877)   The early afternoon is our early afternoon. 
<br>[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2882)   The early afternoon of our practice. 
<br>[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2885)   And for Eliot, also the early afternoon of humanity. 
<br>[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2893)   Given how he would have viewed what our future should be, 
<br>[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2902)   what is this watery mirror? 
<br>[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2906)   Well, it's the water on the surface of the ice 
<br>[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2911)   that's somewhat melted. 
<br>[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2913)   But a watery mirror is an imperfect vehicle of reflection. 
<br>[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2921)   There's distortion, and yet it is a mirror. 
<br>[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2926)   Some of you may be familiar with 
<br>[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2931)   the Buddhist notion of the five, 
<br>[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2934)   of the great mirror wisdom. 
<br>[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2937)   There's these five wisdoms, 
<br>[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2939)   and one is called 
<br>[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2942)   the great complete mirror wisdom in Chinese. 
<br>[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2956)   So, this is also a metaphor for the wisdom function 
<br>[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2962)   of the teenage meditator. 
<br>[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2970)   A little bit of the wisdom function is arising 
<br>[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2973)   in your midwinter spring of your practice. 
<br>[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2978)   But it's still a watery mirror. 
<br>[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2980)   It's not crystal clear. 
<br>[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2982)   And the blindness that he is talking about, 
<br>[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2986)   about the glare that blinds you, 
<br>[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2992)   is a direct reference to the Christian contemplative tradition. 
<br>[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=2999)   What's known as Taboric illumination. 
<br>[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3003)   T-A-B-O-R-I-C. 
<br>[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3005)   What a great word. 
<br>[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3007)   We need to use that word in ordinary conversations 
<br>[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3011)   more frequently. 
<br>[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3012)   Taboric. 
<br>[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3013)   It means referring to Mount Tabor. 
<br>[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3017)   Har Tavor in Hebrew. 
<br>[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3021)   Choshen and I have been there. 
<br>[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3022)   We've run retreats there, actually. 
<br>[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3025)   And it features prominently in the New Testament, 
<br>[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3030)   specifically the Transfiguration. 
<br>[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3033)   That's where the Church of the Transfiguration is. 
<br>[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3038)   And what happened there, according to the story, 
<br>[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3044)   is Jesus was there with some of his disciples. 
<br>[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3047)   By the way, it's called a mountain, 
<br>[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3049)   but believe me, it's just a little hill. 
<br>[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3052)   But a very important hill in the history of Western spirituality. 
<br>[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3059)   Iconic, actually. 
<br>[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3061)   So what happened was Jesus was there with some of the disciples, 
<br>[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3068)   and he just rose up into the sky. 
<br>[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3073)   Moses is on one hand, Elijah on the other. 
<br>[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3078)   And there's this light that just knocks everyone on the ground. 
<br>[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3084)   All the disciples are just basically physically knocked down 
<br>[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3090)   by this radiance that's sort of illuminating, 
<br>[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3096)   transfiguring Jesus and the two made prophets 
<br>[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3102)   from the Old Testament. 
<br>[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3105)   Great art, great iconic. 
<br>[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3109)   That light, the blinding light, was called taboric illumination. 
<br>[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3116)   We know about it, of course, from Eastern practices, 
<br>[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3120)   where it's called the clear light of the void. 
<br>[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3123)   Some of you have experienced it. 
<br>[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3125)   It can come during the night or during sitting practice. 
<br>[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3132)   If you've ever experienced it, you know it is quite intense. 
<br>[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3138)   But even just the sea rest, the grayscale blank, 
<br>[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3142)   is a beginning of a hint of that. 
<br>[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3147)   So Eliot is talking about that also. 
<br>[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3151)   In other words, he's describing England in a certain season, 
<br>[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3155)   but he's describing the mid-practice point, 
<br>[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3162)   where you might be after 20, 30 years of practice. 
<br>[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3168)   In terms of, yeah, we're along, 
<br>[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3174)   but we still have a very long way to go. 
<br>[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3183)   Midwinter spring is its own season, 
<br>[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3187)   sempiternal though sodden towards sundown, 
<br>[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3191)   suspended in time between pole and tropic. 
<br>[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3196)   When the short day is brightest with frost and fire, 
<br>[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3201)   the brief sun flames the ice on pond and ditches. 
<br>[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3206)   In windless cold that is the heart's heat, 
<br>[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3211)   reflecting in a watery mirror a glare that is blindness 
<br>[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3218)   in the early afternoon. 
<br>[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3221)   And a glow more intense than blaze of branch or brazier 
<br>[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3229)   stirs the dumb spirit. 
<br>[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3233)   No wind, but Pentecostal fire in the dark time of the year, 
<br>[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3241)   between melting and freezing the soul's sap quivers. 
<br>[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3246)   This is the springtime, but not in time's covenant. 
<br>[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3252)   Now the hedge grow is blanched for an hour 
<br>[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3256)   with transitory blossom of snow. 
<br>[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3272)   Of snow, a bloom more sudden than that of summer, 
<br>[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3279)   neither budding nor fading, not in the scheme of generation. 
<br>[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3289)   That light was called the ungenerated light of the source, 
<br>[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3297)   not in the scheme of generation. 
<br>[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3315)   Between melting and freezing, the soul's sap quivers. 
<br>[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3322)   There is no earth smell or smell of living thing. 
<br>[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3327)   This is the springtime, but not in time's covenant. 
<br>[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3334)   Now the hedge grow is blanched for an hour 
<br>[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3337)   with transitory blossom of snow, 
<br>[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3340)   a bloom more sudden than that of summer, 
<br>[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3343)   neither budding nor fading, not in the scheme of generation. 
<br>[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3354)   Where is the summer? 
<br>[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3357)   The unimaginable zero summer. 
<br>[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylfrzPKRnJE&t=3387)   The End 
<br>
