title: "Our SUBJECTIVE Experience EXPLAINED (See-Hear-Feel technique) by Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=0)   Mental images, mental talk, emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=18)   So in general, if you look from the side, mental images tend to be sort of centered 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=28)   here, but they can be around your surroundings, and they can also be back where your body 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=35)   is. 
<br>[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=36)   But memory-planned fantasy tends to sort of be up and in front. 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=40)   Talk tends to be posterior and up, and then the emotional body is primarily down with 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=47)   the body. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=48)   So very, very roughly speaking, you've got a triangle like this. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=58)   It's an oversimplification, but it's a way of thinking about it. 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=60)   This is the center of the inner space, but the inner space can be broad, it can be quite 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=68)   wide, actually. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=69)   So emotional body space is just the space of your body. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=73)   Some people have emotional centers, places in the body where pleasant or unpleasant emotional 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=79)   sensations would likely be most prominent. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=82)   Some people don't have emotional centers. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=84)   If you have emotional centers, then bringing yourself to your emotional body means some 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=89)   awareness strongly in those centers and some awareness peripherally over the body. 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=94)   If you don't have emotional centers, then just awareness in your body in general is 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=99)   to be in emotional body space. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=103)   Talk space is typically ill-defined, but most people sort of point at their ears, their 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=107)   head, this area, it's the phallic. 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=110)   So abstractly and in an oversimplified schematic view, we can think of image space, talk space, 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=122)   emotional body space. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=124)   Our descriptive word for visual thinking is mental image, but our label is see in. 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=132)   Our descriptive word for auditory thinking is mental talk, but our label is hear in. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=139)   And our descriptive word for emotional body sensation is emotional body sensation, however 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=144)   the label is feel in. 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=152)   So whenever I think about this system, I sort of get this image of the triangle. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=161)   But I also get the phrase that this system is reactive, proactive, interactive, and occasionally 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=174)   inactive. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=179)   If you get this, you will have such a handle on life. 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=186)   Such a handle on life. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=190)   Because every heaven and hell that you will experience between now and the moment you 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=195)   die will somehow involve the four things that I just mentioned within this system. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=204)   It's reactivity, it's proactivity, it's interactivity, and it's occasional inactivity. 
<br>[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=213)   So let's see what that means. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=216)   It means if you have external sounds, external sights, and physical body sensation, it could 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=223)   trigger one, two, or all three of these at the same time. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=227)   So it reacts to the physical senses. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=233)   Producing what? 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=234)   Well if that reaction is unconscious and solidified, it produces the sense that there is a self 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=243)   that hears, sees, and is physically contacted. 
<br>[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=250)   So if you're in pain, and this system is reacting to the pain, judging it, awfulizing it, and 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=260)   having rhythmic reactions such as fear, tear, irritation, helplessness, and so forth. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=272)   So that's the self, alright? 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=276)   That's this system reacting to a physical contact, a physical world. 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=282)   So as a reactive system, when it activates, and it's not experienced with concentration, 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=291)   clarity, and equanimity, it will convince you that you have a limited self that is seeing, 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=297)   hearing, and in a physical world. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=302)   So on the other hand, we're not trying to get rid of this activity. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=307)   It can activate to the max, but as long as there's clarity, concentration, and equanimity, 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=312)   in other words, as long as you have a complete experience of self. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=316)   And by the way, equanimity is none other than total self-love and total self-acceptance 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=322)   in this regard. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=325)   So if it reacts and you experience it fully, then you love it to death. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=331)   It's so active that it's no longer there as a thing. 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=335)   So there's... 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=336)   Okay, so. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=340)   So that's the reactive system. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=343)   Every single time you're convinced there's someone inside of you that's a self experiencing 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=352)   an other that is alien and it. 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=356)   At some subtle level, the system is reacting to the physical world. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=362)   It may be subliminally below the threshold of awareness, and our job is to clarify it 
<br>[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=368)   and unblock it and love it. 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=373)   That's the reactive. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=374)   Proactive. 
<br>[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=375)   Oh, you've noticed this. 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=376)   It's called monkey mind. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=377)   When it's not reacting to the outside world, it starts spinning memory, plan, fantasy, 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=388)   problem solving. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=390)   Fantasies basically two kinds. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=394)   Fantasies that you run to scare you, and fantasies that you run to entertain you when there's 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=400)   nothing else going on. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=403)   In neuroscience, this is well known, it's called the default network. 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=409)   Default meaning it's what people fall back on when you don't ask them to attend to something 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=413)   in an experiment. 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=414)   They would tell people, okay, now just rest now. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=418)   Okay, we're having you watch that target, that visual target now, do nothing, just rest. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=424)   And then they discovered they're not resting. 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=427)   There's all this distinctive activation going on by way of default. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=432)   So what's happening is monkey mind. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=435)   Is memory, plan, fantasy, problem solving, etc. 
<br>[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=443)   So I call that the proactive system, meaning that the system will just go off on its own 
<br>[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=449)   and spin memory, plan, fantasy. 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=452)   Convincing you that there's a past, convincing you that there's a future, convincing you 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=457)   of many, many things. 
<br>[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=461)   So that's the proactive side of the system. 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=464)   Once again, we're not trying to get rid of that. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=468)   We're trying to have a complete experience of that. 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=471)   Then the system is interactive. 
<br>[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=474)   That means a mental image could trigger an emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=478)   Mental thought could trigger an emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=483)   Emotional body sensation could build until you just have to make a comment about it, 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=490)   or have a picture of it. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=491)   A mental image could trigger a comment. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=494)   A mental thought could make a picture to accompany it. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=500)   So the arrows point both ways. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=501)   This is the interactivity of the system. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=504)   And once you become familiar with the system, you can start to track how this will trigger 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=509)   this, and then this will lead to this, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=514)   So that's the interactivity. 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=519)   And becoming clear about this is knowing yourself at a sensory level, at a system theoretic 
<br>[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=527)   level. 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=528)   This is the system theoretic paradigm for thoughts and emotions. 
<br>[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=536)   Then the last phrase is occasionally inactive. 
<br>[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=541)   Actually more than you might imagine. 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=543)   For brief moments, the system turns off hundreds and hundreds of times during the day. 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=550)   When you just hear, just see, just experience physical touch, for just a second, the system 
<br>[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=558)   actually evaporates. 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=561)   But people usually don't notice it. 
<br>[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=563)   So it doesn't help them. 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=564)   They don't realize that the self winks in and out of existence during the day. 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=571)   So when it goes inactive, we have a no-self state. 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=578)   But unless you consciously experience it, it won't be liberating. 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=584)   So we want you to be able to notice when it's active and inactive. 
<br>[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=589)   So that's the subjective system, and that's what we're going to work on today. 
<br>[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=597)   I'm going to show you how to work individually and collectively. 
<br>[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=605)   So if we draw a column, we're going to use in as an abbreviation for inner arising. 
<br>[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=618)   We use see to refer to visual experience. 
<br>[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=623)   It's a verb of visual perception. 
<br>[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=626)   Hear is the verb of auditory perception. 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=630)   Feel is the verb for somatic perception. 
<br>[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=633)   So see in for mental images. 
<br>[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=636)   Hear in for mental thought. 
<br>[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=639)   Feel in for emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=641)   We can work individually, and then we could broadly float. 
<br>[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=646)   We'll call this focus in, within the whole system. 
<br>[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=652)   So let me say that most people have quite a bit of hear in. 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=659)   That's where we're going to start. 
<br>[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=663)   So we're going to know hear in each time the mental talk arises. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=670)   When the mental talk comes to an end, gone. 
<br>[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=674)   That's the period at the end of the sentence. 
<br>[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=678)   And then if there is no mental talk, hear rest. 
<br>[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=681)   Sometimes people find that by placing attention in talk space, it sort of like turns off the 
<br>[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=688)   mental talk. 
<br>[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=689)   That's not suppression. 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=690)   It just is. 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=691)   It just happens that way. 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=693)   So you'll hear rest. 
<br>[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=694)   You'll listen to that restful state. 
<br>[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=697)   Otherwise, hear in, gone. 
<br>[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=699)   Some people find that after the gone, there'll be a restful state. 
<br>[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=704)   Some people find that there's immediately a new arising of the next word or phrase or 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=710)   sentence. 
<br>[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=711)   So you'll hear in, gone, hear rest. 
<br>[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=712)   That's how we can work individually with this. 
<br>[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=715)   This is actually pretty straightforward. 
<br>[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=720)   Mental images and emotional body sensations require a bit of clarification. 
<br>[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=727)   First and foremost, if you're new to practice, you may not have many mental images. 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=738)   And that's not a problem. 
<br>[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=739)   You just may not have many of them. 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=742)   So we're going to have you focus on the dark, bright, in front of, behind your closed eyes, 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=749)   which is, you'll recall, is see rest. 
<br>[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=752)   Focus on that if you don't have any mental images. 
<br>[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=755)   But if you do have mental images, we'll note that as see in. 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=759)   If all or even part of the mental image drops away or drops off, then gone. 
<br>[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=767)   You'll note the vanishing of all or part of the image. 
<br>[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=771)   If you don't have many mental images, then fine, you'll just be see rest, see rest until 
<br>[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=775)   they occur. 
<br>[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=776)   Remember, however, that if you have memory, plan, or fantasy, you probably are seeing 
<br>[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=783)   the memory scene, probably seeing the fantasy and so forth. 
<br>[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=789)   We don't call it imagination for nothing. 
<br>[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=793)   But it may be very vague and fleeting, just a ghostly impression. 
<br>[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=798)   That's see in. 
<br>[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=800)   People often think that, oh, mental images, it must be clear like a photograph or like 
<br>[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=806)   looking at a physical object. 
<br>[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=808)   Only for some people, the great majority of people, the mental images are these vague, 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=814)   wispy, diaphanous impressions of form that disappear very quickly. 
<br>[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=822)   And that's see in, that's image. 
<br>[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=825)   Remember also that if you are aware that you're in any particular place, if you're convinced 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=830)   you're in a room with people at a certain location, you probably get some vague image 
<br>[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=837)   of your surroundings that's see in. 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=839)   And when you have body sensations, you probably get a sense of your overall body and your 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=844)   appearance. 
<br>[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=845)   In addition to the sensations of the body, there's the image of the body. 
<br>[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=849)   Once again, often rather vague and ill-defined. 
<br>[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=853)   That's see in also. 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=856)   So that's that. 
<br>[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=860)   Feel in is, there's a lot to be said about this. 
<br>[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=870)   So at any given instant, somewhere in consciousness, you may experience emotion. 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=883)   The alternative is at any given instant, you're not experiencing any emotion. 
<br>[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=890)   If you're not sure, assume you're not experiencing any emotion. 
<br>[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=895)   So at any given instant, you may have an experience of emotion. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=904)   That emotion may be well-defined qualitatively or ill-defined qualitatively. 
<br>[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=908)   It may be intense or it may be subtle. 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=913)   Quite where that emotion is occurring may be well-defined or it may be ill-defined. 
<br>[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=918)   However, at any given instant, you either have an emotional experience or you don't. 
<br>[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=925)   If you're not sure, assume you don't. 
<br>[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=929)   If you are having an emotional experience, it is possible that part of that emotional 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=934)   experience will involve body sensations, a change in your body. 
<br>[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=940)   If so, our label for that body sensation is feel in. 
<br>[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=947)   It is possible that you have an experience that you'll say is emotional, but it's mental 
<br>[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=952)   only and does not affect the body. 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=955)   In which case, there is no emotional sensation in the body. 
<br>[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=959)   The emotion is completely mental. 
<br>[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=961)   That could happen. 
<br>[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=962)   In that case, when we work with this, and you're having a mental emotion, but there's 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=971)   nothing that impacts your body. 
<br>[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=974)   Your body is emotionally restful. 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=980)   So we'll call that feel rest. 
<br>[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=985)   If you go to your body and try to figure out which sensations are physical and which are 
<br>[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=992)   emotional, you may be able to do that, but you probably won't. 
<br>[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=996)   It will probably just be crazy to try to figure that out. 
<br>[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1002)   Somewhat depends on the individual. 
<br>[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1004)   The way that I set up this category, feel in, is not specifically I'm asking you to 
<br>[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1014)   go to the body and figure out what's physical, and more generally what's emotional. 
<br>[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1018)   If you can do that, fine, but most people, it's like, it doesn't compute. 
<br>[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1025)   However, here's something anybody can do. 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1029)   At any given instant, you ask yourself, am I experiencing emotion? 
<br>[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1034)   Somewhere. 
<br>[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1035)   Well defined, ill defined, okay, am I experiencing emotion? 
<br>[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1040)   The answer is yes. 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1042)   Is any part of that experience, does any part of that experience involve body sensation? 
<br>[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1047)   The answer will either be yes or no. 
<br>[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1049)   If you're not sure, the answer is no. 
<br>[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1052)   If the answer is yes, that's feel in, and that's what to focus on. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1057)   If the answer is no, then when we play this technique, your body is emotionally neutral. 
<br>[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1062)   That is a flavor of rest. 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1064)   There are basically three flavors of rest that can come up in the body. 
<br>[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1069)   Physical relaxation, emotional neutrality, and the sense that there are parts of the 
<br>[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1075)   body that aren't there, or that your body is disappearing. 
<br>[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1079)   Those are the three basic flavors of feel rest. 
<br>[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1083)   When we do this, if there is no emotion in your body, then feel rest. 
<br>[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1089)   It is quite common for people to, when they try, when they do see in, that they mostly 
<br>[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1096)   just see rest. 
<br>[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1097)   It is quite common when people do feel in, that they mostly just feel rest. 
<br>[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1102)   In other words, the syntheties don't activate. 
<br>[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1105)   This usually activates, but sometimes it doesn't even. 
<br>[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1109)   Now, are you going to make it a problem that there is nothing but rest within this system? 
<br>[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1116)   Please don't. 
<br>[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1118)   Someday it will activate, I promise you. 
<br>[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1121)   Now, so a common complaint is, well, when I do formal practice, and I try to work with 
<br>[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1132)   my subjective experience, it's all rest. 
<br>[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1136)   The system doesn't activate. 
<br>[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1139)   It goes inactive during formal practice. 
<br>[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1142)   Or this part might be active, but these other two parts aren't. 
<br>[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1148)   During formal practice, I can never get the feel in or the see in going. 
<br>[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1154)   So I have a, but then in daily life, of course, it is going, but I don't have the wonderful 
<br>[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1159)   situation of being in formal practice to work with it. 
<br>[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1163)   So what should I do? 
<br>[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1165)   So what is my standard recommendation for this situation? 
<br>[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1171)   Do nothing. 
<br>[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1173)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1177)   Or, in other words, of course, the do nothing is okay. 
<br>[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1181)   You can just accept the fact that nothing is happening. 
<br>[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1187)   But let's say that you want to be in a formal practice situation, and you want to be able 
<br>[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1193)   to at will activate and control the direction and intensity of the subjective reactive system. 
<br>[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1202)   Okay, which would be a way of working smart, a way of training where you're in control, 
<br>[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1209)   so that when the reactive system gets activated in daily life, you sort of train yourself 
<br>[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1216)   in ideal situations. 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1218)   Well, what I recommend is that you expose yourself to emotive sounds or emotive sights 
<br>[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1227)   that activate the system. 
<br>[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1229)   Sound is the best, because you can do it with your eyes closed. 
<br>[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1232)   It's easy to detect the images. 
<br>[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1234)   So I usually recommend something like flipping around the TV and then getting things that 
<br>[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1241)   activate pleasant or unpleasant. 
<br>[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1244)   Feel in, you'd be amazed how many images you have if you listen to the soundtrack of a movie. 
<br>[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1251)   Your mind would just immediately try to see what's going on, okay? 
<br>[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1256)   And so it activates the whole system. 
<br>[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1260)   And that way you train yourself to work with the system, and you can have the best of both 
<br>[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1266)   worlds, because you're in a formal practice situation, and you're in control of the type, 
<br>[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1273)   duration, and intensity of the stimulus for the system. 
<br>[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1279)   So if you come to me and say, I'm not getting a carryover into life, I'm going to ask you, 
<br>[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1292)   well, have you tried media practice? 
<br>[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1294)   Have you tried training for life's impacts in stillness? 
<br>[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1301)   I call that working smart. 
<br>[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1304)   So at the retreat, if not much activates when we explore this, that's fine. 
<br>[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1308)   We'll just do the rest of the thing. 
<br>[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1310)   But there are ways to intentionally activate it, and not necessarily in negative directions 
<br>[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1315)   either, just all sorts of interesting things can be done. 
<br>[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1319)   So that's the subjective system. 
<br>[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1322)   Yes? 
<br>[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1323)   Can we, while training here for a life situation, can we imagine ourselves in those situations, 
<br>[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1328)   and then that system gets activated? 
<br>[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1330)   I understand. 
<br>[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1331)   That, the intentional, as a general principle, intentionally controlling the system is only 
<br>[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1340)   something we do as focus on positive, which we'll be starting in the afternoon. 
<br>[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1345)   However, I said as a general principle. 
<br>[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1347)   People will sometimes ask, well, can I activate it by sort of thinking about a certain something? 
<br>[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1353)   I would say it's OK to do that occasionally. 
<br>[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1356)   I wouldn't make that the centerpiece of your practice. 
<br>[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1359)   Yes? 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1360)   In terms of feel, you're talking about the emotional body. 
<br>[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1363)   What's the distinction between a headache and the emotional body, or is that part of 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1368)   the emotional body, or that thing? 
<br>[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1370)   OK, good. 
<br>[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1371)   That's a good question. 
<br>[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1372)   The way you know it's an emotional body sensation is by following that little procedure that 
<br>[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1380)   I just gave you. 
<br>[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1383)   In other words, if you ask yourself, am I experiencing an emotion? 
<br>[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1390)   And then you go to the body and see if any part of that is in the body. 
<br>[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1396)   In other words, you didn't have an emotion, then an emotion arose. 
<br>[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1402)   What changed in the body, that's the emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1407)   The places to look are reactions. 
<br>[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1410)   If there's a sound and you're smiling, that's an emotional sensation in the body. 
<br>[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1419)   If there's a sound in the environment and you're irritated by the sound, and it's not 
<br>[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1425)   just mental comment about it, but you actually have an irritation in the body, that's emotion 
<br>[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1431)   in the body. 
<br>[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1432)   In general, I will give you a list of a dozen or so common situations where there is likely 
<br>[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1444)   to be an emotional sensation in your body. 
<br>[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1448)   Anger. 
<br>[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1449)   When you experience anger, where do you usually experience it in your body? 
<br>[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1454)   Are you asking me? 
<br>[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1455)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1456)   How would you answer? 
<br>[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1458)   OK, good. 
<br>[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1459)   So that's an emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1461)   Fear. 
<br>[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1462)   That's an emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1465)   Sadness. 
<br>[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1466)   That's an emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1471)   Joy. 
<br>[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1472)   That's an emotional body sensation. 
<br>[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1477)   Enthusiasm, interest. 
<br>[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1481)   Not sure? 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1483)   OK. 
<br>[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1484)   Shame, embarrassment. 
<br>[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1487)   OK. 
<br>[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1488)   You got it. 
<br>[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1491)   All of those are emotional body sensations. 
<br>[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1494)   Physical pain? 
<br>[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1495)   No. 
<br>[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1496)   That's a physical body sensation. 
<br>[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1498)   However, if it causes an emotional reaction, then that could happen. 
<br>[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1504)   So how do you work with that? 
<br>[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1506)   Let's say I start to sit, I mean I came in with some physical pain, I start to sit and 
<br>[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1513)   then I have emotional reaction to physical pain. 
<br>[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1515)   It's not something I bring up, it's not something that starts when I sit. 
<br>[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1519)   Am I making any sense? 
<br>[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1522)   Are you asking how to work with the pain or... 
<br>[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1526)   Or the emotional reaction to it. 
<br>[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1529)   OK. 
<br>[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1530)   So in other words, let's say that you're doing the feel-in technique. 
<br>[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1538)   OK. 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1539)   So you are... the instruction is if you have what seems to be emotional body sensation 
<br>[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1545)   you focus on. 
<br>[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1546)   So now the pain, what flavors of emotion does the pain cause you? 
<br>[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1552)   Fear. 
<br>[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1553)   Fear. 
<br>[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1554)   Now you're very precise. 
<br>[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1556)   So now you're going to be aware that the pain is one thing and the fear reaction to the 
<br>[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1561)   pain is another thing. 
<br>[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1563)   You're going to note that as feel-in. 
<br>[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1566)   The fear reaction. 
<br>[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1567)   That sensation. 
<br>[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1569)   Then what does note mean? 
<br>[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1571)   Note means acknowledge and then focus on that sensation. 
<br>[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1574)   As you focus on that sensation you attempt to accept that sensation. 
<br>[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1579)   The fear sensation. 
<br>[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1581)   Remember I said reactive? 
<br>[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1583)   So you're looking for the body reacting to the body. 
<br>[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1587)   In this particular case. 
<br>[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1589)   And then what do you do with it? 
<br>[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1591)   Just try to make friends with it as best you can. 
<br>[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1595)   Now, that's only one way to focus of course. 
<br>[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1598)   You might want to focus on the mental images triggered by the pain. 
<br>[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1603)   Or the mental talk triggered by the pain. 
<br>[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1605)   You also might want to focus on the pain itself. 
<br>[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1607)   Or you might want to focus away from the pain onto a rest state. 
<br>[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1611)   All of these are options. 
<br>[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1613)   Just be clear which one you're doing. 
<br>[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1616)   Did that answer your question sufficiently? 
<br>[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1619)   OK. 
<br>[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1620)   Excellent. 
<br>[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1621)   Yes. 
<br>[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1622)   I just want to clarify if we were working with this procedure. 
<br>[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1625)   And we were having a lot of rest in C-in. 
<br>[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1630)   And a lot of rest in feel-in. 
<br>[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1633)   We would not be noting that because we're not focusing on the rest. 
<br>[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1637)   There's actually four procedures on the board. 
<br>[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1641)   So let's be clear what we're talking about. 
<br>[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1645)   This is one option. 
<br>[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1647)   This is another option. 
<br>[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1648)   This is another option. 
<br>[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1649)   This is another option. 
<br>[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1651)   Right. 
<br>[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1652)   OK. 
<br>[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1653)   So if you're doing this, the instruction says, 
<br>[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1656)   if you don't have any activation, note the corresponding restful state. 
<br>[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1661)   But if you do have an activation, then note the activation. 
<br>[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1665)   Of course, if you did it for a while and there wasn't any activation, 
<br>[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1668)   then you might want to switch technique because you're essentially not just noting the restful state. 
<br>[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1674)   OK. 
<br>[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1676)   Same thing for here. 
<br>[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1678)   The instruction says it's crystal clear. 
<br>[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1680)   As long as you're doing this procedure, which could be for two minutes or two years, 
<br>[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1686)   however long you want to be doing it, if there's mental talk, you're in. 
<br>[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1690)   When it disappears, go off. 
<br>[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1692)   If there's no mental talk, you're at rest. 
<br>[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1695)   And you just do that. 
<br>[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1697)   And then if it doesn't seem productive, you do something else. 
<br>[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1701)   Crystal clear? 
<br>[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1702)   Excellent. 
<br>[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1703)   Yes. 
<br>[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1704)   If you're in the rest state and you want to activate more active state, you recommend, like, turn on the TV. 
<br>[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1713)   Can you use your imagination? 
<br>[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1715)   Can you pretend you're in a traffic jam? 
<br>[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1717)   Actually, that question was just asked a few minutes ago. 
<br>[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1720)   But I'll answer it again. 
<br>[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1723)   In general, you are passive with regards to these things. 
<br>[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1733)   You just let them, when you do this technique. 
<br>[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1737)   So you are waiting for activation to occur. 
<br>[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1740)   If it doesn't occur, then you just note the corresponding restful state. 
<br>[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1746)   However, if you find that the system hardly activates when you do practice in stillness, 
<br>[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1753)   and you want to do something to sort of stimulate it so that you can observe it and practice up with it, 
<br>[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1760)   then I recommend media practice. 
<br>[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1762)   You can listen to a TV or something like that to get things stirred up. 
<br>[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1765)   But that would just be a sort of special thing that you would do to help train your skills. 
<br>[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1773)   Is that clear? 
<br>[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1775)   As far as intentionally bringing something up in order to have something to focus on with this, that was asked over here. 
<br>[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1783)   I said it's okay to do that occasionally, but it's not really the way to do this. 
<br>[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1791)   Okay. Good. Yes. 
<br>[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1795)   Sorry, I had a brain lapse. What does in at the top stand for? 
<br>[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1798)   Inner activation. 
<br>[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1800)   So this technique is see in here and feel in. Focus. 
<br>[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1806)   Focus in. Thank you. 
<br>[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1808)   Focus, as it stands now, when something is prefixed by focus, it means broadly float within that theme or that sensory modality. 
<br>[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1820)   Otherwise, we see the specified in the box. 
<br>[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEAWweizGCc&t=1825)   Okay, good. Good to go. 
<br>
