title: "Touching the Heart ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=0)   So, why did we come here? Why do we do this practice? Well, one way to think about it, 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=16)   among many possibilities, is that we came here in order to touch the heart, both metaphorically 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=29)   and literally. So, we know what it means to have one's heart touched metaphorically. It 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=40)   means to access a place of unconditional love, to love deeply. That's how I would think about 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=58)   the heart that we're trying to touch when we do this practice, when we come to a retreat. 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=66)   So that's sort of on the emotional side. However, this is not the superficial meaning of touching 
<br>[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=78)   the heart. Not that there's anything wrong with the superficial meaning, but the kind 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=87)   of touching of the heart that I'm thinking of, that would be the purpose for this practice, 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=97)   is to love deeply. That would be my phrase. And I would say that the ability to love deeply 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=107)   is related to the second touching of the heart, which I said is a literally touching of the heart. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=118)   So, you might think, oh, literally, then you mean touch the physical heart. No, I mean 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=126)   touch the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter. And the heart of the matter, 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=134)   from the viewpoint of human experience, is, well, what is human experience? 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=143)   What is the essence of our experience at the deepest level? 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=151)   Whenever I go to Canada, one of the things that I look forward to there is the fact that you 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=163)   can get really good Indian food, specifically South Indian food. If you're familiar with what's 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=171)   called the Udupi cuisine, South Indian vegetarian, can't get it very good in the US, but in Mississauga, 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=183)   near the airport, in the Toronto area, you can get this really, really great Indian cuisine. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=195)   And the other great cuisine that I can get in Toronto that I don't get in Burlington or Tucson, 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=202)   for that matter, is Hong Kong style dim sum. And whenever I go to the dim sum restaurant, 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=215)   it always has a kind of association for me, because of the two Chinese characters 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=228)   that in Cantonese are pronounced dim sum. In Mandarin, it's dian xin. So, 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=244)   we like to represent the heart this way. You see it everywhere. And the Chinese character for heart 
<br>[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=256)   is actually fairly similar looking. Not a coincidence, obviously. You can even get the 
<br>[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=265)   aorta a little bit, maybe, and so forth. So, originally, it was definitely a picture of a heart 
<br>[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=274)   that looked a lot like this. So, what's interesting is the phrase dian xin, or dim sum. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=297)   If you're interested, you can look on Wikipedia and you'll see the same history I'm about to tell 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=304)   you. So, dian could mean to warm, sort of warm your heart. So, that's a snack. But also, it can 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=324)   mean to touch or to contact something. If you spot it, you touch it, you have a contact. And so, 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=335)   for me, I always think of those two sides to the practice. The touching of the heart 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=345)   at the deepest level. This Chinese character sum or shin, it means the physical heart, 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=358)   but it also means consciousness, consciousness itself. In some languages, consciousness is 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=369)   a word separate from the word that means heart. For example, consciousness in Greek is nous, 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=380)   but the word for heart is, you know what, cardiology, right? What is it, cardium, I guess, 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=391)   in Greek. It's different words. But it turns out that in Chinese, the word that means, 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=401)   and also Japanese, sen kanji, the word that means the physical heart also means consciousness. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=411)   Sometimes you see it translated as mind, M-I-N-D, but that can be very tricky. 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=417)   Mind can mean mental experience, meaning thought. But sometimes this character can mean that. 
<br>[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=429)   But more broadly, particularly within the context of contemplative practice, it means 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=438)   consciousness. In other words, what I would call sensory experience. So, 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=445)   what is it to directly touch sensory experience? Well, it's to be in the moment, right, with 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=460)   sensory experience. So that is literally to touch the heart of the matter in the sense of, well, 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=468)   every inner or outer heaven or hell that anybody is ever going to experience involves experience. 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=479)   It involves sensory experience. So, if we know something that is universal to all moments of 
<br>[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=490)   consciousness, if we know something about consciousness that is universal and deep and 
<br>[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=497)   deep and helpful, well, then we could say that we have touched the heart of the matter 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=506)   as far as our own personal happiness goes. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=515)   But there's also the warming of the heart, the contacting of the emotional self 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=525)   in a way that one is drawn to service and touching the emotional self in a way that one is able to 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=543)   deeply love, and based on that, able to effectively act in the world. 
<br>[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=553)   I would say that there is a very close relationship between these two forms of touching the heart. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=567)   And spiritual grown-upness, spiritual maturity, well, there's many metrics, many ways that we 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=578)   might measure it, but one way would be the degree to which a person understands the relationship 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=591)   between these two endeavors of touching the heart. They're very closely related, 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=602)   because when you touch the heart in the sense of contact the nature of consciousness, 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=612)   which is just another way to say contact the nature of see, hear, feel, of sensory experience, 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=620)   that connects you directly to the consciousness of all other beings, not as a concept, not as 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=638)   a wishful thinking belief, but as a inescapable moment-by-moment reality as you move through the 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=651)   world. That fundamental alienation, the fundamental separation of inside and outside, 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=660)   that rock-solid concept that says my identity ends with my skin. Outside the skin is out, 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=673)   everything inside the skin and inside this head is in, and that's me, and there is a kind of 
<br>[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=681)   a brick wall that separates these two worlds and leads to fundamental alienation. 
<br>[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=692)   When you touch the deepest part of, or when a person, you, me, anyone, touches directly 
<br>[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=704)   the senses, you discover that there's a commonality. All sensory experience 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=718)   at the deepest level has the same taste, eka rasa, the one taste, 
<br>[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=726)   and that one taste is universal. You are directly then connected to everyone else's consciousness, 
<br>[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=738)   and from that comes quite naturally and easily a sense of 
<br>[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=749)   loving towards each thing that manifests in front of you, if it's a physical object or it's another 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=762)   person. It could be a saint, it could be a sinner, it could be a beautiful flower or a smelly garbage 
<br>[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=770)   can, though on the surface of consciousness, though they're all quite different, they're all 
<br>[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=777)   quite different, but at the instant of perception, what might be called the now in the absolute sense, 
<br>[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=791)   and remember, any duration is just a bunch of nows, so there actually aren't any durations, 
<br>[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=803)   there's only the nows. So when you are in the absolute now, 
<br>[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=819)   you can be aware of surface distinctions, but they're all pervaded by a deep unification, 
<br>[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=828)   and that unification not only unifies mind and body, not only unifies sense and nonsense, 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=839)   not only unifies pleasure and pain, but also unifies inside and outside, and ultimately unifies 
<br>[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=853)   the surface with the source, you might say. True non-dual awareness. So 
<br>[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=868)   as one goes about ordinary activities during the day, one sees, hears, feels 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=877)   the sight, sound, touch of the world, one sees, hears, and feels the image, talk, body, emotion 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=888)   of the psyche, but they all sort of have, not sort of, they all have the same taste. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=904)   And that is, and therefore, each of those experiences comes from and returns to 
<br>[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=920)   the same place, and that place has been given many names confusingly over the years. 
<br>[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=932)   Confusingly over the years, and across the cultures of the world. 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=941)   Some people call it the true self, some people call it no self, 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=948)   some people call it emptiness, some people call it the source. 
<br>[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=953)   In the Tan Dynasty in China, they started to call it 
<br>[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=960)   in the Tan Dynasty in China, they started to call it 
<br>[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=967)   Shin Chi, it means the nature of consciousness, the nature of experience. 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=994)   It's that same character there. 
<br>[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=999)   So, as one sees, hears, feels the world, and as one thinks and has emotions about the world, 
<br>[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1017)   if you are in that moment fully, in the absolute now, 
<br>[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1025)   then it will seem that all of the surface distinctions arise from and return to, 
<br>[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1037)   moment by moment, a single unification. 
<br>[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1044)   And that was also sometimes referred to at that same period as the Buddha nature. 
<br>[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1060)   There's the very famous story that I've commented on many times. 
<br>[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1067)   Does the dog have the Buddha nature? Yes or no? 
<br>[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1078)   It's a very famous story. 
<br>[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1081)   You can answer yes, you can answer no, you can answer both yes and no, 
<br>[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1090)   or you can answer neither yes nor no. 
<br>[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1094)   I will accept all of those answers as long as you deeply understand what each one of them refers to. 
<br>[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1103)   OK, so if moment by moment we're touching the primordial perfection, 
<br>[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1123)   the sound of sound just before you consciously hear sound, 
<br>[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1133)   the sensation in your body just before you consciously experience that sensation, 
<br>[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1143)   the primordial stirring that precedes the arising of mental talk, 
<br>[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1154)   the vibrant matrix from which that arises. 
<br>[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1162)   When we touch that moment by moment during the day in our ordinary goings and comings, 
<br>[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1173)   we connect. 
<br>[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1176)   The fundamental separation between inside and outside goes away. 
<br>[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1182)   So that the first thing that one sees or hears or feels, 
<br>[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1188)   the very first thing, the actual sparsha, the actual touch, 
<br>[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1196)   the actual contact with the now of the senses, 
<br>[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1204)   that very first taste is a taste of connection. 
<br>[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1216)   We can call that touching the heart literally, if we use heart in the Chinese sense of the word. 
<br>[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1226)   The very next thing after that is a spontaneous natural sense of love 
<br>[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1238)   for what had hitherto earlier in your life been looked upon as the other. 
<br>[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1251)   That's the next instant. 
<br>[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1254)   And then what is the next instant after that? 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1258)   The next instant after that is whatever. 
<br>[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1263)   Maybe it's a judgment. 
<br>[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1265)   Maybe it's a plan. 
<br>[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1267)   Maybe it's nothing in particular. 
<br>[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1270)   You just move on to the next thing. 
<br>[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1273)   It's what would have been there if you hadn't meditated. 
<br>[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1280)   But because you did meditate and you stayed with it 
<br>[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1284)   until it took you to the deep end of the pond, 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1290)   now, before all that ordinary stuff that still does occur just like it did before, 
<br>[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1298)   preceding your judgment or your plan or your association or your ignoring and moving on, 
<br>[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1311)   because it has been preceded by touching the heart literally 
<br>[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1322)   and then the warming of the heart, 
<br>[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1326)   the deep love that comes from inescapable connection, 
<br>[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1335)   because all the ordinary stuff is always preceded by what I just said, 
<br>[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1347)   the actions that we take in the world become more effective. 
<br>[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1356)   So we have that ability to love deeply and act effectively. 
<br>[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1366)   And it's optimized, it's potentiated, it's empowered by this direct contact. 
<br>[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1375)   Direct contact is exactly the same as the now, the absolute now. 
<br>[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1386)   So some of you know that a common definition of mindfulness, 
<br>[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1395)   due to Jon Kabat-Zinn, is present-centered, non-judgmental awareness or something like that. 
<br>[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1407)   But actually, if you wanted to really simplify things, 
<br>[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1411)   you could leave off the non-judgmental. It's redundant. 
<br>[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1417)   Do you understand what I'm saying? It's redundant to present-centered. 
<br>[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1422)   So most people, if you say present-centered or I'm present or something like that, 
<br>[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1431)   they can only associate it with what they've experienced. 
<br>[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1436)   So what one is likely to think is, 
<br>[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1446)   oh, present-centered must mean I'm not thinking about the past, 
<br>[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1453)   or I'm not lost in my thoughts. That's what it means to be present-centered. 
<br>[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1462)   Or when I eat, I know I'm eating. When I walk, I know I'm walking. 
<br>[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1471)   So that kind of present-centered is a good thing. 
<br>[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1476)   And in fact, that's pretty much where we start. 
<br>[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1481)   I would call that being relatively in the present moment. 
<br>[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1486)   And as I say, you've got to start somewhere. 
<br>[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1489)   So that's relatively in the present moment is where you start. 
<br>[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1494)   Hopefully that will mature to being absolutely in the present moment. 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1505)   That's a very, very different critter. 
<br>[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1511)   You could be thinking about anything. 
<br>[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1513)   You could be thinking about the past or the future, 
<br>[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1517)   but you're instant by instant so in contact with the image or the talk and so forth 
<br>[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1528)   that there's no time to fixate time and space. 
<br>[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1534)   You don't fixate a duration. 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1539)   You don't have the notion I've been thinking for the last three minutes. 
<br>[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1547)   To have that notion, you have to have been fixating the overall. 
<br>[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1554)   If you're just at the razor's edge of the present, well, that razor's edge cuts both ways. 
<br>[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1565)   So there can't be any extension through time. 
<br>[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1571)   Likewise, if there's no time, then there's no time for it to spread in space. 
<br>[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1583)   And so when you're in the absolute now, you're at the source of time 
<br>[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1589)   and the experience of time and space. 
<br>[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1593)   But your experience is not embedded in time and space. 
<br>[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1602)   So that's another way to think about the endeavor. 
<br>[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1610)   It's when you touch the heart, when you touch consciousness directly, 
<br>[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1619)   you have an experience that is in a sense outside of the time-space continuum. 
<br>[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1631)   Sometimes that's described as abiding in the unborn. 
<br>[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1640)   That's an interesting way to think about things. 
<br>[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1645)   Okay, so what I've said so far may sound a little bit abstract. 
<br>[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1659)   Can I make it more tangible? Sure. 
<br>[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1666)   However, I would hasten to mention that just like the metaphor of the blind man and the elephant, 
<br>[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1680)   there are many, many, many valid alternative descriptions 
<br>[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1690)   of what it is like to be in the absolute now or touching the heart of the matter. 
<br>[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1699)   Many valid descriptions. 
<br>[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1701)   There's one particular one that I like, and it's just one that I like for a variety of reasons. 
<br>[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1712)   I'm used to it. 
<br>[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1714)   I like it because it seems to have some relationship to certain things that come up in math and science and so forth. 
<br>[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1723)   And that is the paradigm of expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1731)   So if I were to put it into words, if I were to try to describe my own experience, 
<br>[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1744)   I would say that one, in the beginning of practice, has to struggle to just keep track of what's going on. 
<br>[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1765)   As you get some skill, you're able to keep track of what's going on. 
<br>[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1774)   And more and more, you become aware that things arise and then they pass. 
<br>[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1790)   Let's say you have an experience of pain. 
<br>[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1797)   Your leg didn't hurt, and then it starts to hurt, and then it hurts, and then the bell rings. 
<br>[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1811)   That's where you start. 
<br>[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1813)   But then as you deepen, you'll notice, well, it's not quite just it started and then it lasted and then it stopped. 
<br>[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1824)   There's like a little bit of waviness on it, a little bit of fluctuation. 
<br>[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1847)   So the first view is it starts, it lasts for a while, see which side it goes from here, right? 
<br>[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1860)   It starts, it lasts for a while, then it stops. 
<br>[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1864)   But then as you pay a little more attention, you'll see it starts, 
<br>[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1869)   and maybe there's a little bit of fluctuation there. It's not absolutely the same. 
<br>[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1885)   And then you start to ask yourself, well, what's the source of that ripple? 
<br>[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1896)   It's not really very intense. You wouldn't notice it until you start to really pay attention. 
<br>[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1904)   Well, the reason there's a subtle ripple on the surface, and ripple doesn't mean it's necessarily regular, 
<br>[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1914)   but there's some fluctuation. It gets a little stronger, it gets a little weaker. 
<br>[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1921)   If nothing else, when you get distracted, it diminishes a little bit, and then when you come back to it, it sort of intensifies. 
<br>[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1929)   But as you start to fathom whence the ripple, 
<br>[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1935)   you'll see that actually underlying that seeming duration of unchangingness, 
<br>[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1944)   underlying it is a sequence of arising-passing, arising-passing, arising-passing. 
<br>[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1955)   So some of you know what, most of you I guess, are familiar with the concept of a fractal. 
<br>[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1964)   So now, okay, we have arising-passing, arising-passing, arising-passing. 
<br>[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1970)   But now, look at an arising. Let's look at a single arising under the microscope. 
<br>[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1980)   Well, turns out there's a lot of little arisings and passings modulated on that. 
<br>[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1987)   And each one of those comes from and returns, comes from and returns, comes from and returns. 
<br>[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=1996)   So, as you're, if you selectively attend to just the arising phase, 
<br>[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2009)   at some point, all of the arisings become a single continuous spread of space. 
<br>[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2022)   Because before a surface, see, hear, feel arises, 
<br>[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2032)   before it arises as an opaque objectified something, 
<br>[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2038)   deep down there has to be a stirring of pre-conscious processing 
<br>[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2046)   that sort of creates a space. 
<br>[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2055)   And if you notice that space beginning to be created, and you just stay with that, 
<br>[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2063)   you are now in the absolute now. 
<br>[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2067)   And there is only the spread of the space itself, 
<br>[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2077)   while at the exact same time, whatever arises on the surface has no time to coagulate, 
<br>[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2087)   and so all of the passings merge into a single simultaneous effortless collapse 
<br>[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2097)   of the time-space continuum. 
<br>[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2101)   So, in the end, the reason something wells up is that 
<br>[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2110)   it is simultaneously spreading and collapsing. 
<br>[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2114)   In its beginning is its end. In my beginning is my end. 
<br>[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2118)   That's a line from T.S. Eliot. 
<br>[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2121)   No sooner is it arising, but it's already passing. 
<br>[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2125)   And if all of the arisings, if you're absolutely in the present moment, 
<br>[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2132)   all of the arisings become a single spread of space. 
<br>[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2138)   And all of the passings become a single collapse of space. 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2144)   And it's like a fountain that's simultaneously gushing and gathering. 
<br>[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2150)   We might refer to that as absolute activity. 
<br>[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2161)   An activity that is so continuous that it never turns into a now. 
<br>[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2169)   It just stays as a verb. 
<br>[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2175)   By way of contrast, sometimes there's no arisings or passings. 
<br>[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2183)   Or, put it, put another way, sometimes something passes 
<br>[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2190)   and nothing replaces it for a period of time. 
<br>[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2195)   And by a period of time I mean the clock on the wall is moving, 
<br>[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2201)   but the clock inside is not moving. 
<br>[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2206)   So, yes, it's a period of time. You could say 3 seconds or 3 minutes or 3 hours, 
<br>[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2212)   whatever it is, something passed and nothing replaced it. 
<br>[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2218)   Or another way to put it that might sound a little more feasible 
<br>[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2224)   is the tug of the senses goes away. 
<br>[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2228)   There's no pull to inner or outer worlds. 
<br>[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2233)   So if there's no pull to time, there's no pull to space, 
<br>[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2241)   we might call that absolute rest. 
<br>[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2245)   So one way to describe the absolute now at a small time-space scale, 
<br>[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2257)   using now time-space in the relative sense, 
<br>[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2260)   one way to describe it at a small scale is there's a cycle. 
<br>[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2267)   There's absolute rest and then that absolute rest breaks apart. 
<br>[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2275)   We could call the absolute rest zero because it's not polarized 
<br>[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2280)   into anything that's affirmative or negative. 
<br>[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2288)   That's the answer to the koan, does the dog have a buddha nature? 
<br>[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2293)   If you answer no, that's a correct answer. 
<br>[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2300)   But you have to understand that that no, N-O, is not the no of yes versus no. 
<br>[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2307)   That's the big capital no. 
<br>[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2335)   Inevitably, that absolute rest, that singularity, 
<br>[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2341)   that spiritual black hole, in the good sense of black hole, the source, 
<br>[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2353)   inevitably it breaks apart because it's unstable. 
<br>[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2361)   It isn't a thing. 
<br>[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2366)   It's what happens when all the yeses and all the nos, 
<br>[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2370)   the relative yeses and nos, all the affirmation and negation, 
<br>[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2379)   needed to mold this or any conceivable universe, 
<br>[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2384)   when all the binary polarities simultaneously cancel out. 
<br>[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2395)   So zero is actually just all the positives and negatives. 
<br>[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2407)   When they come together, they give you zero. 
<br>[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2410)   In a sense, it's very rich, it contains everything, but it's not a thing. 
<br>[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2419)   And because of that fundamental instability, it breaks apart. 
<br>[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2425)   When it breaks apart, half of it only knows to expand, 
<br>[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2430)   half of it only knows to contract. 
<br>[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2433)   They do their thing. 
<br>[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2436)   If you stay with that, then you are that. 
<br>[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2443)   You're that alternating cycle of absolute activity, absolute rest. 
<br>[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2450)   Absolute activity, absolute rest. 
<br>[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2453)   So life on this planet is a cycle. 
<br>[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2456)   Relative activity, relative rest. 
<br>[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2459)   Or no, no, that's not the way to put it. 
<br>[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2461)   I take that back. 
<br>[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2465)   Phrenetic activity during the day and fitful rest during the night 
<br>[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2473)   is the cycle of this planet for many people. 
<br>[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2479)   So in a sense, it's a similar cycle, 
<br>[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2487)   but instead of being driven activity and fitful, phrenetic activity and fitful rest, 
<br>[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2496)   it's effortless activity and absolute, profound, big stop rest. 
<br>[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2513)   So don't you experience that cycle. 
<br>[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2519)   That's one way to describe what it's like when you touch consciousness directly. 
<br>[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2528)   So then, if that's what the source tastes like, 
<br>[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2535)   then what does the surface taste like? 
<br>[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2538)   The surface tastes like whatever, inner and outer, see, hear, feel. 
<br>[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2544)   That surface is like so much foam that's born in the cleft 
<br>[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2552)   between expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2556)   Like when you, you know, there's this very expensive property in this part of California. 
<br>[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2566)   You're on the ocean, it costs a lot of money, right, 
<br>[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2569)   to have like a house that's, right, overlooking the Pacific. 
<br>[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2575)   Why is it that people are willing to pay so much money for that kind of property? 
<br>[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2582)   Well, one interpretation is so that you can just look out your back window anytime you want, 
<br>[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2589)   or your front window, depending, 
<br>[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2591)   and you can see the source by watching the waves. 
<br>[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2598)   When the wave comes in, you'll see that it's simultaneous expansion and contraction. 
<br>[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2604)   The surface of the wave is moving towards the land, 
<br>[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2608)   but there's an undertow that's pulling it out towards the center of the ocean at the same time. 
<br>[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2615)   And when the wave breaks, you have the, like the famous Hokusai, 
<br>[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2622)   like the waves at Kanagawa, you know, that famous ukiyo-e print, Japanese woodblock print. 
<br>[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2632)   So you have this like Hokusai wave. 
<br>[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2637)   The crest breaks. 
<br>[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2639)   The part that is expanding separates from the part that's contracting. 
<br>[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2644)   And they create a gap with a bunch of foam and a lot of noise. 
<br>[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2652)   And then at some point, you notice the force that's moving towards the shore stops. 
<br>[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2661)   The force that's pulling back stops, and there's a cessation. 
<br>[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2666)   All the foam and all the noise goes away, and then the cycle starts again. 
<br>[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2672)   How is it that D.S. Eliot put it? 
<br>[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2677)   Not seen because not looked for, but heard, half heard, 
<br>[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2684)   in the stillness between two waves of the sea. 
<br>[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2689)   And all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well. 
<br>[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2697)   Okay, that's absolute rest. And then the cycle starts again. 
<br>[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2702)   Polarization, neutralization. 
<br>[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2706)   And you're aware both of the undercurrent, or both of the ocean of consciousness, 
<br>[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2719)   but you're also aware of the foam and the noise. 
<br>[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2724)   But it's just foam and noise. 
<br>[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2728)   It's just an epiphenomenon. 
<br>[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2731)   The foam and the noise are the inner and outer scenery of the senses. 
<br>[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2745)   So that you cannot contact the world through sight, sound, touch, 
<br>[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2755)   or contact the world through image, thought, body, emotion. 
<br>[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2761)   You can't contact the world or contact your own personal identity 
<br>[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2768)   without first contacting that which links everything together. 
<br>[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2776)   And that is the first touching of the heart. 
<br>[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2782)   And then from that, there will be automatically, whether you want it or not, 
<br>[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2788)   a sense of love, just like the little child. 
<br>[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2792)   Like Jesus said, lest ye become as little children, you cannot enter the kingdom. 
<br>[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2805)   So this is going back to what it was like, if you can remember, 
<br>[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2810)   in the very early part of life, the first few months of life. 
<br>[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2819)   Now, it's true sometimes, you know, the neonate is upset and crying and uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2828)   But not always, okay? 
<br>[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2833)   And when it's not upset or crying or uncomfortable, where is it? 
<br>[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2838)   What is it experiencing? 
<br>[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2841)   In recent years, I've started to remember, I mean, vividly remember, 
<br>[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2847)   my earliest experiences. 
<br>[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2851)   And they were absolutely the experience of simultaneous expansion and contraction 
<br>[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2856)   when I was okay as a little infant. 
<br>[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2859)   And at maybe around the age of two or three or four, five, six, 
<br>[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2870)   I'm not quite sure exactly where, but I can remember that going away 
<br>[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2879)   and something replacing it. 
<br>[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2884)   And I actually remember thinking, something's wrong. 
<br>[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2891)   Something's wrong. 
<br>[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2893)   What happened? 
<br>[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2896)   Everything was okay. 
<br>[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2898)   And now I'm worrying and I'm afraid and I'm always thinking about everything. 
<br>[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2908)   And I'm never really happy for no reason now. 
<br>[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2914)   I can remember losing the kingdom of heaven. 
<br>[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2922)   That I've actually remembered all my life, 
<br>[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2924)   but what I didn't remember was specifically what the kingdom of heaven felt like. 
<br>[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2931)   Of course, because I'd lost it. 
<br>[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2934)   After many decades of practice, oh, yeah, that's what it was. 
<br>[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2940)   Now I remember. 
<br>[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2942)   And fortunately, I encountered this practice that allows me to go back 
<br>[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2950)   and sort of do it again, but this time do it right. 
<br>[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2957)   Or another way to put it is be in the enviable position of having your cake and eating it too. 
<br>[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2964)   Meaning when everything's fine for the infant, well, they're in this primordial perfection, 
<br>[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2973)   but they don't know how to negotiate the world, 
<br>[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2977)   so they're likely to hurt themselves or do something inappropriate. 
<br>[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2981)   So you go through these life experiences, good news, bad news. 
<br>[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2986)   Good news, you become adult, you know not to touch fire or run out into the street or what have you. 
<br>[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=2996)   You know how to negotiate the world as an adult. 
<br>[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3000)   Bad news, you lost the primordial perfection. 
<br>[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3004)   Having your cake and eating it too is the best of both worlds. 
<br>[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3009)   You're a competent adult that can act effectively in the world. 
<br>[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3016)   And yet while you're doing that, actually literally while you're doing that, 
<br>[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3022)   you don't lose contact with this primordial perfection. 
<br>[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3028)   So if you touch the heart that way, in other words, touch the nature of consciousness, 
<br>[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3044)   then your heart will be touched because it seems in the emotional sense, 
<br>[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3051)   because it seems like you're always looking at yourself. 
<br>[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3056)   And that's a very emotional experience. 
<br>[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3061)   If the self that you're looking at is a garbage can, 
<br>[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3069)   or let's say somewhat more melodramatically, 
<br>[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3076)   a human being that smells to you like a garbage can because of the way they act, 
<br>[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3086)   you do experience oneness first, you do experience unconditional love next. 
<br>[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3094)   But if you need to take an action to correct that person, 
<br>[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3100)   well, that action is going to be more effective if you've touched the heart 
<br>[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3108)   in the two ways that I just described before the action. 
<br>[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3114)   And touching the heart in the two ways that I just described takes a fraction of a second. 
<br>[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3122)   In fact, it's always there, whether you notice it or not. 
<br>[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3126)   So the effect of that on how one acts in the world, the decisions one makes, 
<br>[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3134)   the actions, the words that one speaks, 
<br>[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3138)   the effect of touching the heart in two ways is with time to make us 
<br>[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3148)   much more effective in the world. That's the phrase I like to use. 
<br>[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3160)   And that could be described as a balanced practice. 
<br>[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3169)   So we can speak of what I just described as the deepest, 
<br>[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3183)   as one way to talk about the taste of consciousness at the deepest level. 
<br>[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3195)   One way to talk about it. However, we don't have to use the phrase deep. 
<br>[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3204)   I like that phrase. It comes natural. However, it is a spatial metaphor of going down. 
<br>[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3211)   And in fact, that's quite a good metaphor for the process. 
<br>[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3215)   We can describe this path as a kind of journey from surface to source. 
<br>[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3221)   We don't really turn away from the senses. We sort of turn at right angles 
<br>[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3227)   and auger down into consciousness. So between surface and source, 
<br>[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3233)   some people encounter unusual phenomena, other people don't. 
<br>[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3239)   But certainly one way to think about it is, well, we're augering down 
<br>[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3244)   into the center of consciousness. It's like a sphere. 
<br>[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3250)   However, in other traditions, Western traditions, it's thought of as going up 
<br>[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3258)   because God's in heaven. So we are sort of transcending this low earth existence 
<br>[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3268)   and we find this spiritual thing that's considered to be above. 
<br>[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3274)   Now, it's fine if you want to think of it as ascending to Shalom Bim Rumav, 
<br>[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3283)   the peace of God's own heaven. You could think of it that way. 
<br>[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3288)   St. John of the Cross talked about Subida del Monte Carmelo, 
<br>[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3294)   the ascent of Mount Carmel. So that's a sort of going up. 
<br>[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3298)   But he did say when he drew the picture of climbing Mount Carmel, 
<br>[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3306)   he actually drew it like, you know, a picture of it. It's been preserved. 
<br>[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3311)   And written on this picture is nada, nada, nada, nada, 
<br>[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3318)   that every place along the journey up is nothing, nothing, nothing. 
<br>[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3324)   And then at the very top, he has y en monte nada. 
<br>[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3329)   And when you finally reach the peak, that's the nothing because it's not a thing. 
<br>[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3338)   It's either absolute rest outside of time and space or it's absolute activity 
<br>[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3347)   that is the cleft that we call time and space, 
<br>[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3356)   within which self and world arise and are reabsorbed, 
<br>[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3361)   arise and are reabsorbed over and over again. 
<br>[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3364)   So if you want to think of it as going down, you can. 
<br>[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3368)   If you want to think of it as going up, you could think of it that way. 
<br>[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3376)   However, the more scientific and somewhat prosaic way to describe it, 
<br>[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3387)   and if I wasn't being allowed to talk poetry and be metaphorical, 
<br>[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3395)   if I was constrained to speak to a group of scientists, which I often am, 
<br>[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3402)   I wouldn't use this language at all. 
<br>[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3405)   I would not talk about deep or high. 
<br>[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3411)   I would talk about just before. 
<br>[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3415)   I would use temporal language. 
<br>[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3417)   And that is not metaphor, that's not poetry, that's actually physical science. 
<br>[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3424)   Here's what I mean. 
<br>[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3433)   There's a standard test that is done for newborn children 
<br>[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3443)   where they test the auditory system of the child. 
<br>[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3451)   And the way that they do this is through what's called brainstem auditory evoked potential. 
<br>[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3462)   So brainstem means what it sounds like really deep down in your brain. 
<br>[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3470)   Evoked potential, well a sound will evoke a voltage change 
<br>[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3479)   in a processing center in the brain. 
<br>[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3483)   And a sight will do the same. 
<br>[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3487)   Any kind of sensory event creates changes in electrical patterns in the brain. 
<br>[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3498)   And those are typically monitored through voltage. 
<br>[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3502)   You don't actually look at the electrical field directly, 
<br>[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3507)   you don't look at the current. 
<br>[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3515)   You monitor volts, which is called electrical potential. 
<br>[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3521)   So when you have a sensory experience, inner or outer, 
<br>[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3526)   it causes a pattern of electrical, or it's associated with a pattern of electrical activity in the brain. 
<br>[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3534)   And if you monitor that electrical activity in voltage, 
<br>[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3538)   then the change in voltage that's caused or associated with the sensory experience, 
<br>[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3545)   that's called an evoked potential. 
<br>[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3547)   In other words, it's a potential that happens because of something, 
<br>[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3552)   some experience you're having. 
<br>[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3554)   So an auditory evoked potential means a voltage change, 
<br>[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3562)   in this case associated with external hearing. 
<br>[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3566)   So they'll expose the infant to a sound, 
<br>[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3571)   and they have electrodes placed so that as the sound is being processed, 
<br>[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3587)   first the sound strikes the tympanic membrane, the eardrum, 
<br>[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3594)   and then that causes the inner bones to move, 
<br>[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3599)   and then that causes pressure changes in the organ of Corti, 
<br>[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3606)   and those then create a first voltage in the spiral ganglion. 
<br>[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3613)   And then there's a next voltage a little further up, 
<br>[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3617)   which I think is called the trapezoid body, but I could be wrong, 
<br>[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3621)   and then there's another voltage, I should have reviewed my neuroanatomy before this talk, 
<br>[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3627)   in one of the, let's see, it must be the, I think the inferior colliculus, 
<br>[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3636)   then maybe the next is the, what's it called? 
<br>[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3645)   Forgetting the name. 
<br>[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3652)   It'll come back. 
<br>[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3655)   And then you have the primary and secondary auditory cortices that are in the temporal lobe. 
<br>[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3663)   So there's, you know, about at least a half dozen processing stations, 
<br>[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3668)   and there's only a few milliseconds between, you know, tens of milliseconds, 
<br>[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3674)   that's a thousandth of a second, right, so literally it takes a fraction of a second 
<br>[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3681)   to jump from each of those processing stations. 
<br>[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3686)   Yeah, pretty sure it was the medial geniculate body. 
<br>[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3693)   Oh, right, right. 
<br>[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3697)   Okay, so I told you I'd remember. 
<br>[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3703)   So each one of those is a processing station, and you can actually track it physically in time. 
<br>[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3713)   And if the infant has a problem, you can actually tell exactly where the problem is, 
<br>[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3722)   where neurologically there's a break in the processing. 
<br>[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3730)   So over a period of maybe a second or two, from the very first striking of the, 
<br>[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3739)   from the very first evoked potential in the spiral ganglion 
<br>[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3747)   or the final evoked potential on the secondary acoustic cortex, 
<br>[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3761)   there's these sequences of processing. 
<br>[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3764)   And this isn't just true for hear-out, it is presumably true for all sensory experience. 
<br>[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3773)   So as your detection skills increase with time, you're actually sort of able to hear, 
<br>[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3788)   maybe you go from the, I don't think it's literally this, but something like, 
<br>[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3794)   first you only consciously hear on the secondary auditory cortex, 
<br>[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3801)   and then you start to hear what the primary hears, which you'd never heard before, 
<br>[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3807)   except it's a little different from sound, but it's obviously sound. 
<br>[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3813)   And then maybe you're able to hear into the geniculate body, 
<br>[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3818)   and then you're able to hear into the, what did I call it, the colliculus, 
<br>[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3827)   and then into the trapezoid body. 
<br>[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3830)   And then finally maybe you can actually hear in the ear itself, 
<br>[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3836)   except by that time it's no longer sound. 
<br>[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3841)   It's the origin of sound, which is the origin of visual and auditory in you 
<br>[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3852)   and in all other sentient beings, in everything. 
<br>[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3857)   At some point you hear back to the unstruck sound, the anahata shabda in Sanskrit. 
<br>[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3871)   Also, that's from South Asia, from East Asia, exactly the same concept, 
<br>[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3879)   the sound of one hand. There's no clapping, that's the English version. 
<br>[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3888)   The Japanese version and Chinese version is one hand sound. 
<br>[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3899)   So you hear the unstruck sound, you see the unilluminated sight, 
<br>[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3913)   you feel the incorporeality of the corpus. 
<br>[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3920)   And what do you see, hear, feel? 
<br>[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3927)   This alternating cycle of absolute activity, absolute rest. 
<br>[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3935)   So you're able to simultaneously tune into what is temporally the earliest 
<br>[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3943)   that connects you to everything. You touch consciousness, you touch the heart. 
<br>[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3949)   But you're also able to tune into all the other stations, including the surface. 
<br>[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3956)   And on the surface you experience love for no reason other than the all reason. 
<br>[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3966)   And then you do what you need to do in the world. 
<br>[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3972)   As human beings develop the ability to do that, and I do suspect that if we survive, 
<br>[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3980)   we will, as a species, develop the ability to do that. 
<br>[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3986)   I think we are the early adapters, or early adopters, I guess that's the phrase. 
<br>[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=3994)   Also early adapters, actually, historically. We're the early adopters. 
<br>[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4000)   I suspect if there is a future for us, this is going to be a major feature of the future. 
<br>[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4007)   So, absolute rest breaks apart into absolute activity, and then returns. 
<br>[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4030)   On small time-space scales, that's what it's like. It's cyclic. 
<br>[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4035)   Absolute rest, absolute activity, and then the relative experiences born in between. 
<br>[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4044)   However, at large time-space experiential scales, it's always simultaneous expansion and contraction. 
<br>[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4055)   It's an eternal fountain. 
<br>[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4066)   How well I know that fountain that gushes and flows, although by night, 
<br>[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4074)   because of course you're in the formless, it's in the emptiness, it's the activity of emptiness. 
<br>[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4087)   So, you could, St. John of the Cross, who said those words in Spanish in the 16th century, 
<br>[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4096)   this is what he was referring to. So, there's this eternal fountain that for everyone 
<br>[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4105)   is constantly gushing and gathering, and giving birth to and reabsorbing 
<br>[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4113)   the inner and outer scenery. And to the extent to which this is a reality for you, 
<br>[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4135)   to that extent you know, oh, this is what I am at the deepest level. 
<br>[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4141)   This is what everyone is at the deepest level. This is the heart of the matter. 
<br>[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4150)   And therefore, to the extent to which that's a reality for a person, to that extent, 
<br>[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4163)   the horrors of old age, sickness, and death are much less troubling to one. 
<br>[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4179)   Because this deeper identity is eternal. It's ironic. The non-thing that is a doing 
<br>[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4199)   of impermanence, it's permanent. And to the extent to which you have this figure-ground reversal, 
<br>[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4212)   instead of being the product of this activity, you can, to a certain extent, 
<br>[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4219)   say, I am that activity itself. The extent to which one can say that, to that extent, 
<br>[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4232)   one's own frailty, physical frailty, mortality, and so forth, well, you can somewhat 
<br>[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4243)   sidestep that. You have this place to go to. 
<br>[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4257)   So, to touch the heart in the sense of liberation, and then to touch the heart 
<br>[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4271)   in the sense of a call to loving service and effective action, 
<br>[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXbRafMuBM&t=4284)   pretty much sums up why we came here. 
<br>
