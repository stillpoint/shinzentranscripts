<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=0)   So I just had a session with Diane. 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=10)   If I'm incoherent, you can blame her. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=14)   Because I may be a little too much into my body, so we'll see how much of the upper chakras 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=25)   are functioning at this point. 
<br>[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=28)   Okay, so we've been talking about the possibility of mindfulness revolution. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=41)   And I've made a few points, let's just review. 
<br>[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=47)   We have some guests tonight coming in in many arrests, so to speak. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=54)   So I like to think about mindfulness from what might be described as a unified point 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=65)   of view, a very widely encompassing point of view. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=73)   I think it is possible to have, through careful analysis of the dimensions involved, it's 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=83)   possible to understand certain underlying commonalities, not just for the Southeast 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=95)   Asian Buddhist practice, which is where current mindfulness historically came from, but more 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=103)   broadly all of Buddhist practice, and more broadly still all of contemplative practice 
<br>[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=110)   all around the world. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=115)   Any contemplative practice, East or West, could be nicely analyzed in terms of the degree 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=125)   to which, the way in which, three core skills are talked about, cultivated, and applied. 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=139)   So the three core skills are concentration, sensory clarity, and equanimity. 
<br>[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=144)   You can think about concentration as the ability to focus on what you deem relevant at a given 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=153)   time. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=154)   What's important about that way of describing concentration is not so much what I said, 
<br>[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=159)   but what I didn't say. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=161)   I did not imply that concentration is necessarily limiting the spatial scope of your focus. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=168)   I did not imply that concentration necessarily was holding just one thing for a long duration. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=181)   Concentration could be expansive, it can cover a large domain. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=185)   Yes, it could be spatially contractive also, and those are actually sub-dimensions of the 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=191)   concentration skill, how broad or narrow you focus. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=195)   Concentration could be momentary, you can make break, make break, make break, make break, 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=201)   taste momentary high concentration on a variety of objects. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=206)   But you can also have sort of what people often think about when they hear the word 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=211)   concentration, which is holding just one thing in attention for an arbitrary duration of 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=219)   time. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=220)   It's like you can hold the sensation at the tip of your nostril for four hours without 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=225)   any wavering whatsoever. 
<br>[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=228)   Now that ability to hold just one thing for an extended duration of time, that certainly 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=234)   is a sub-dimension of the concentration skill. 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=237)   However, the ability to make break, make break, make break, and have what is called khanika 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=242)   samadhi or momentary high concentration, that's also very important, especially if you want 
<br>[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=249)   to maintain mindfulness, a deep state of mindfulness while you're engaging in daily life, you're 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=258)   driving a car, you're having a conversation. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=262)   Eventually we want you to experience being very, very deep while you're moving around 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=269)   and to get the MMM, maximum meditation mileage, out of each moment of daily life to monasticize 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=278)   your life as we were talking about in the group process. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=281)   For that, understanding that the dimension of concentration skill, which is momentary 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=287)   high concentration but consciously tasted, as I say it's technically called khanika samadhi 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=293)   in the Pali language. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=295)   So speaking of concentration as the ability to attend to what you deem relevant, not saying 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=307)   it has to be this thing or that thing, it has to be your breath or your body, not limiting 
<br>[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=315)   it by its range and not limiting by saying, well, it has to be something small, it could 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=321)   be something large. 
<br>[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=324)   Not limiting the concept of concentration to, well, it has to be a long duration on 
<br>[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=329)   just one thing. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=331)   It could be momentary on a variety of sensory targets as they present themselves. 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=337)   So as I say, the way I like to talk about concentration, what's important is not just 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=345)   what I say, but what I don't say, because there is a tendency to assume that concentration 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=354)   means hold a small thing for a long period of time. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=360)   And yes, indeed, that represents two dimensions of the skill, but there are other facets to 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=366)   it. 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=369)   Concentration is to focus on what you deem relevant. 
<br>[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=372)   Sometimes you'll hear people say, well, I don't want to learn to concentrate because 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=377)   I need to let my attention freely float in order to be creative and make associations. 
<br>[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=383)   Well, if that's what's relevant to the moment, then your ability to do that will be enhanced 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=390)   by concentration. 
<br>[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=392)   Concentration will not get in the way of that intuitive flux. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=397)   In fact, it will enhance it. 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=399)   You'll focus just on the place in consciousness that makes those connections for you because 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=405)   that's what's relevant to that moment. 
<br>[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=408)   So concentration power, sensory clarity has the second aspect. 
<br>[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=413)   It has two sub-dimensions, basically. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=416)   You know, I've talked about it in the group process. 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=420)   Resolution, the ability to upgrade the discrimination or bandwidth within the sensory circuits themselves. 
<br>[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=435)   That's the resolution. 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=436)   And then detection. 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=437)   Subtle is significant. 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=439)   The ability to detect subtle sensory events that are normally subliminal is hugely important 
<br>[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=446)   on this path. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=448)   So concentration power, resolution, and detection skills, particularly the ability to detect 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=458)   the very instant when a new sensory event arises and the very instant when an old sensory 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=466)   event passes. 
<br>[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=468)   Because where things come from and where they go to are the same place. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=475)   And we've talked a little bit about the primordial great perfection. 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=480)   Well, that's what proceeds and follows each ordinary inner and outer sensory experience. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=491)   So the ability to detect what happens at the very instant of the arising of any sensory 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=498)   experience and the ability to detect what happens as it's passing is the ability to 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=506)   briefly be vectorially directed towards something that is beyond sensory experience. 
<br>[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=516)   Something that is beyond the embedding of time and space. 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=524)   Okay, so sensory clarity. 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=528)   Equanimity. 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=529)   Originally, equanimity as a term from the Latin, equa anima, literally means a balanced 
<br>[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=539)   state. 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=540)   And originally it meant sort of being unmoved and unexpressive. 
<br>[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=548)   But that's not at all what it means as a technical term to describe the dimensions of mindful 
<br>[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=556)   awareness, not at all. 
<br>[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=559)   It's balanced in a different sense, balanced in the sense of not pushing on experience 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=571)   that's trying to arise, so not suppressing the arisings, and not inappropriately holding 
<br>[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=581)   sensory experience that's about to pass. 
<br>[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=584)   So it's basically training the sensory circuits into a, training away their subtle tendencies 
<br>[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=600)   to interfere with themselves. 
<br>[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=605)   It's analogous to reducing friction in a mechanical system. 
<br>[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=612)   That's at least the way I think about it. 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=615)   So we cultivate these, so I said that I like to think of mindfulness, so the modern mindful 
<br>[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=630)   movement in my own mind, the phrase that I like to use is that it's contemplative-based 
<br>[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=643)   psycho-spiritual growth working in concert with science. 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=651)   So a two-way street. 
<br>[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=653)   Science will help us understand it in a way that we could never have understood it before, 
<br>[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=659)   even the great masters of the past didn't know even basic neuroscience. 
<br>[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=665)   So they could only give a first-person report, and they did so brilliantly, but with the 
<br>[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=672)   current ways to objectively think about the biophysical basis of our experience and so 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=682)   forth, that's going to give us now an incredible advantage to innovate, to understand at deeper 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=690)   levels what's involved in these psychologically and spiritually significant growth that humans 
<br>[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=704)   go through when they do this practice. 
<br>[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=707)   So working in concert, meaning we look to science to improve and deepen our understanding 
<br>[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=716)   of what's going on, but also the mindfulness practice will improve the scientists as humans 
<br>[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=722)   and as professionals, and so you get a positive feedback loop going that could be very impactful 
<br>[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=732)   in the next century or so. 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=734)   I'm a big picture guy, so I look to the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=745)   Toynbee, who is a very famous historian, made an extraordinary statement. 
<br>[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=754)   He said that when all is said and done, it is possible, he didn't say this would happen, 
<br>[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=759)   but he said it is possible that big picture-wise, in retrospect, three or four centuries from 
<br>[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=768)   now, the single most important event of the 20th century will be the discovery on the 
<br>[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=776)   part of the West of Buddhism. 
<br>[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=782)   That is a direct quote from Toynbee. 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=786)   So not that I think the Western world is going to adopt the Buddhist religion, but there 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=797)   are certain discoveries that the Buddha made that I think will absolutely pass the test 
<br>[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=806)   of time and turn out to be very important for the whole human race. 
<br>[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=814)   So that's sort of the basic paradigm that I presented to you. 
<br>[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=821)   And then I said, so okay, that's the modern mindfulness movement, but how about mindfulness 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=827)   itself? 
<br>[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=828)   How do we think about that? 
<br>[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=830)   So I think about it as the systematic cultivation and broad application of those core skills. 
<br>[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=842)   Mental awareness being defined as concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity working 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=848)   together. 
<br>[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=851)   So broad application, reducing suffering, elevate fulfillment, understanding oneself 
<br>[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=859)   at all levels, increasing skillful actions, and ultimately, the ultimate application is 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=873)   in discovering a spirit where you want to serve from love, that in Buddhism we call 
<br>[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=882)   the bodhicitta. 
<br>[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=884)   So we talked yesterday about the dimension of application, which is understanding yourself 
<br>[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=895)   at all levels. 
<br>[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=897)   And just to make things sort of give some organization to things, I said we might consider 
<br>[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=910)   four aspects of that. 
<br>[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=917)   So one aspect would be more surface, which is to understand your own personality. 
<br>[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=928)   How do these skills relate to understanding your own personality? 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=934)   Now, as you're sitting and practicing, you've all noticed this, sometimes insights will 
<br>[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=941)   arise spontaneously that are personal insights. 
<br>[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=944)   You sort of understand yourself. 
<br>[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=947)   And that's nice. 
<br>[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=948)   And that's the result of observing yourself in a mindful state. 
<br>[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=955)   However, there may be aspects of understanding your own personality that don't just percolate 
<br>[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=963)   up spontaneously in your practice. 
<br>[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=968)   You may have to go to a professional, a counselor, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, to address 
<br>[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=980)   certain aspects of personality if they don't get taken care of automatically by the practice. 
<br>[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=989)   And the way you'll know that the practice hasn't taken care of it is you've been practicing 
<br>[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=994)   for 20 or 30 years and people tell you you're still an asshole. 
<br>[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1000)   So clearly something's, you know, you know through feedback, okay? 
<br>[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1010)   You know through, you know, things not working out. 
<br>[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1016)   It's like, well, I've learned to transcend and it doesn't bother me that, you know, stuff 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1023)   is not working out because of my behavior. 
<br>[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1030)   But actually it should sort of bother you. 
<br>[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1034)   And if the practice can't address it, then, well, there are specialists who work at the 
<br>[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1041)   personal level. 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1042)   That's what they're trained to do. 
<br>[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1044)   So the practice may address understanding yourself at the personal level. 
<br>[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1050)   Maybe it's all you need or maybe you need something else. 
<br>[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1056)   So then there's what might be called the depths or the subconscious. 
<br>[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1065)   So certain forms of therapy claim to address that. 
<br>[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1070)   In fact, your classical therapies, they don't call it depth psychology for nothing, Freudian, 
<br>[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1077)   Jungian, and so forth, claim that they get down to that level, whereas other forms of 
<br>[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1083)   therapy might not. 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1084)   I'm not going to get involved in whose claims are valid, but it's just something to know 
<br>[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1093)   about, okay? 
<br>[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1095)   There are the depths. 
<br>[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1099)   Part of the depths are personal, but some of them, Jungians would claim, that there's 
<br>[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1105)   a collective unconscious, that there's things deep down there that are sort of universal. 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1112)   So you may come in direct contact with those depths as the result of mindfulness practice. 
<br>[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1129)   You will definitely come indirectly in contact with them. 
<br>[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1139)   But once again, there are practices that are not strictly part of mindfulness that are 
<br>[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1149)   designed to sort of touch those levels. 
<br>[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1153)   First of all, depth psychology. 
<br>[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1156)   But secondly, shamanism, our ancient ancestors all over the world in the tribal forms of 
<br>[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1169)   culture would contact the spirit world. 
<br>[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1177)   One nice way to get in contact with that, if you're interested, is to do, say, Native 
<br>[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1184)   American ceremonies and things like that. 
<br>[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1186)   Now there's more to the Native American path than that, because of the nature, in order 
<br>[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1195)   to find the spirit world, typically you do shamanic ordeals. 
<br>[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1202)   You expose yourself to hot here, like sweat lodge or sun dance. 
<br>[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1209)   In Japan, you expose yourself to cold. 
<br>[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1212)   You have to chant mantras squatting under a waterfall in winter for hours on end. 
<br>[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1222)   So all around the world, shamanism entails physical sacrifices. 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1233)   And those sacrifices are done within a ritual context, which of course encourages a concentrated 
<br>[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1240)   state and encourages a state of equanimity. 
<br>[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1247)   So although they may not systematically deconstruct their personhood, just doing those ceremonies 
<br>[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1256)   in order to contact the spirit world would tend to have the effect of taking people into 
<br>[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1267)   the deepest level, which is the source, which is that formless doing that I talked about 
<br>[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1278)   a few minutes ago. 
<br>[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1279)   What precedes each sensory and motor arising and what follows each sensory and motor arising 
<br>[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1288)   is something beyond form. 
<br>[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1293)   And so there's the world of spirits, which is the subconscious, and then there is the 
<br>[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1301)   great spirit or the dharmakaya, we would call it in Buddhism, the formless absolute rest 
<br>[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1308)   and absolute activity that is at the source of each moment of perception and expression 
<br>[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1321)   for us. 
<br>[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1322)   So the result of attempts to contact the spirit world through what was apparently natural 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1333)   to all of our ancestors all over the world, which is you fast, you expose yourself to 
<br>[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1340)   heat, expose yourself to cold, you go without water, you allow yourself to be pierced or 
<br>[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1348)   scarified or other such things that forces you into the spirit realm, that's true, but 
<br>[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1360)   it also forces you into a state of high concentration and equanimity, which would then likely lead 
<br>[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1367)   you to a no self or an experience of touching something that is beyond the spirits, which 
<br>[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1383)   could be called the great spirit. 
<br>[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1385)   But as I say in Buddhism, we call it the dharmakaya, means the body of the absolute. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1391)   And then the realm of spirits is called the sambhogakaya, which is the realm of glorious 
<br>[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1399)   forms. 
<br>[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1400)   And then the surface is called the nirmanakaya, the conventional experience. 
<br>[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1406)   So Native American specifically and shamanic broadly can make a nice complement to the 
<br>[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1418)   mindfulness practice because it can take you to the experience of the very deepest level 
<br>[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1426)   that we'll talk about a little more in a minute. 
<br>[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1430)   But it also, if you're interested in contacting the quote spirit world, the archetypes, the 
<br>[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1437)   realm of archetypes, well, that's another specialist that can supplement the mindfulness 
<br>[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1446)   practice. 
<br>[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1447)   So okay, understand the surface individual personality, either through the practice, 
<br>[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1454)   just intrinsically, or maybe go to a specialist. 
<br>[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1459)   Understand the subconscious, either just through the practice or maybe go to a specialist. 
<br>[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1472)   Another aspect is what I started to talk about yesterday, which is to understand yourself 
<br>[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1478)   as a sensory system. 
<br>[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1482)   So the way that I like to do that, it can be done in various ways, but my favorite way 
<br>[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1493)   is to work with mental image, mental talk, and body emotion. 
<br>[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1499)   The reason I like to work with those three sensory elements is that they, as far as I 
<br>[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1505)   can tell from introspection, they form a natural system. 
<br>[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1512)   And I believe that we'll be able to use neuroscience to ferret out those connections. 
<br>[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1520)   In fact, that's sort of the main goal of my projects at Harvard Medical School, are to 
<br>[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1530)   tease out that inner system and see if we can find the neural correlates of it as a 
<br>[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1537)   system. 
<br>[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1539)   So in any event, the mental image, mental talk, and body emotion, see in, hear in, inner 
<br>[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1549)   seeing, inner hearing, and the innermost part of our body experience, which is the emotional 
<br>[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1557)   body, the limbic system. 
<br>[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1562)   They work together. 
<br>[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1566)   There's four basic things that happen. 
<br>[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1572)   They all involve the word action. 
<br>[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1575)   So first of all, there is interaction. 
<br>[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1579)   Mental image can trigger mental talk. 
<br>[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1581)   Mental talk can trigger mental image. 
<br>[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1584)   Mental image can trigger body emotion. 
<br>[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1586)   Body emotion can build until it turns into an image. 
<br>[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1589)   Or body emotion can trigger mental talk. 
<br>[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1593)   Or the whole thing can activate simultaneously, and they're all sort of triggering each other. 
<br>[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1600)   So you can actually watch how the flow of interaction occurs within that system. 
<br>[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1611)   And you can unblock that flow. 
<br>[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1615)   So that's the interactivity of those elements. 
<br>[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1622)   And then there's the reactivity of those elements. 
<br>[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1626)   External sights, external sounds, physical touches arise, and then the inner system reacts 
<br>[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1633)   to those sometimes. 
<br>[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1637)   And when you have an arising of touch, sight, sound, and an arising of image, talk, and 
<br>[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1644)   body emotion at the same time, that creates the sense of the world over here and me over 
<br>[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1655)   here as perceiver. 
<br>[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1661)   So what would happen if there was just touch, sight, sound, and no inner reactivity at all? 
<br>[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1668)   Well, you can actually see what would happen by observing the system. 
<br>[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1675)   You observe the system, and sometimes it doesn't react. 
<br>[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1682)   It simply is inactive. 
<br>[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1686)   And there's no sense of observer, no sense of an eye that's hearing or seeing. 
<br>[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1693)   There's just seeing, just hearing. 
<br>[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1695)   And you are that. 
<br>[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1699)   And the barrier between inside and outside disappears. 
<br>[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1707)   Which makes it rather easy, rather natural to have that sense of wanting to serve from 
<br>[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1714)   love. 
<br>[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1716)   Because it seems like not just every person, but every thing that you look at, you inhabit. 
<br>[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1726)   So you are it. 
<br>[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1730)   So sometimes that system reacts, and sometimes that system is inactive. 
<br>[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1739)   The other thing that that inner system does is it goes proactive. 
<br>[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1744)   That's my own private language. 
<br>[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1746)   Proactive means it disengages from the touch, sight, sound world, and it goes off and begins 
<br>[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1753)   to spin memory, plan, fantasy. 
<br>[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1759)   In neuroscience that's called the default network. 
<br>[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1766)   It has a distinctive signature. 
<br>[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1770)   So it's off and it's problem solving, or it's worrying, or it's fantasizing out of fear, 
<br>[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1780)   or fantasizing out of desire to entertain, etc., etc. 
<br>[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1786)   It's like a home entertainment system. 
<br>[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1787)   It just goes off on its own. 
<br>[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1790)   So you can monitor, you can understand yourself as a sensory system by observing this. 
<br>[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1800)   So why is that useful? 
<br>[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1803)   Well first of all, it can hugely reduce suffering without necessarily changing the content of 
<br>[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1810)   your sensory experience. 
<br>[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1814)   Because when those elements tangle in unconsciousness and coagulate due to lack of equanimity, that 
<br>[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1826)   vastly increases the suffering associated with unpleasant content. 
<br>[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1833)   And that vastly reduces the fulfillment that is potentially there when it's a pleasant 
<br>[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1839)   content. 
<br>[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1840)   So just by bringing untangling, which is your clarity piece, and unblocking, which is your 
<br>[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1846)   equanimity piece, by bringing those qualities to that inner system, you achieve two of the 
<br>[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1854)   dimensions of happiness that I talk about, reduction of suffering, elevation of fulfillment. 
<br>[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1860)   But it's much more than that. 
<br>[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1863)   Working with that system is related to understanding yourself, because you see, oh yeah, this is 
<br>[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1871)   how it actually arises, this I am-ness. 
<br>[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1876)   It's also related to improving behavior, because behaviors are preceded by will. 
<br>[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1889)   If I have an anger issue, or if I have a substance abuse issue, or a procrastination issue, that 
<br>[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1905)   experience of anger, or the will to abuse a substance, or a will that says I don't want 
<br>[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1914)   to do such and such even though I know I should, that arises within that inner system. 
<br>[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1920)   And so your ability to have equanimity with that will break the identification with the 
<br>[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1930)   negative urges. 
<br>[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1932)   And that is not all that's involved in behavior change, but that certainly is an important 
<br>[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1940)   component. 
<br>[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1942)   If you can stay, if you're in recovery and you're jonesing for whatever it is, a cigarette 
<br>[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1949)   or a drink or whatever, well, that's going to come up in that system. 
<br>[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1958)   And if you can track it, unblock it, not suppress the experience of the desire, but also not 
<br>[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1966)   lock on to it, if you can stay with it and just watch it expand and contract, expand and contract, 
<br>[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1972)   for however long it takes, well, it will break up. 
<br>[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1975)   The urge will break up, and that will help you make the behavior change. 
<br>[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1981)   Gives you a very systematic way to go about that aspect of behavior change. 
<br>[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1987)   Now in the morning group process, we talked about the fact that there's more to behavior 
<br>[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=1994)   change than just deconstructing undesirable desires, but that is part of it. 
<br>[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2003)   So it turns out that working with this inner system is germane to certain aspects of objective 
<br>[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2010)   positive behavior change. 
<br>[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2015)   And it's also related to the love and service piece because once you see where that system 
<br>[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2039)   arises from, you realize that everyone arises from that same place. 
<br>[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2048)   So that's another way that you're always looking at yourself, basically. 
<br>[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2055)   So untangling those strands is important in reducing subjective suffering, but it's also 
<br>[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2067)   important in gaining insight. 
<br>[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2071)   So this is where we left off in the talk yesterday. 
<br>[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2079)   Buddhism would say that if you carefully observe the components that create the impression 
<br>[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2088)   I am-ness, you'll see that there are only those components and there actually is no 
<br>[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2094)   thing inside you called a self. 
<br>[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2097)   Now first of all that's counterintuitive because it seems to just about everyone that there 
<br>[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2102)   is a thing inside me called a self. 
<br>[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2104)   So why are you trying to tell me there isn't? 
<br>[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2109)   And the other thing is even if it's true, who wants it? 
<br>[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2118)   What's the payoff for seeing that there's no thing inside you called a self? 
<br>[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2122)   Well let me suggest to you that the experience that in Buddhism is described as seeing that 
<br>[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2129)   there's no thing inside you called a self is one facet on the jewel of enlightenment. 
<br>[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2140)   The jewel of enlightenment has a lot of sides to it. 
<br>[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2144)   That's an important side and anyone that has had these experiences will appreciate why 
<br>[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2152)   someone would like get all excited about pointing out to you that there is no thing inside you 
<br>[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2158)   called a self. 
<br>[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2159)   However that is just one facet of the experience and there are other ways that that experience 
<br>[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2166)   can be described. 
<br>[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2169)   For example it's an experience of a connection to all things. 
<br>[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2178)   It's an experience of the boundary between inside and outside going away or more accurately 
<br>[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2186)   an experience that lets you realize that the boundary was never there to begin with. 
<br>[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2193)   So it's another way to put it, you could say no self or you could say it allows you to 
<br>[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2205)   have an elastic self, an elastic identity that it can expand and contract. 
<br>[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2211)   It can be the normal size which is the normal you or it can reach out and encompass the 
<br>[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2226)   larger world that you normally don't think of as you. 
<br>[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2238)   It can reach out and sort of encompass a person that's in front of you or the flower that's 
<br>[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2246)   in front of you so your identity gets about this big, it can shrink down and be about 
<br>[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2252)   this big but it can get a lot bigger. 
<br>[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2255)   It's elastic. 
<br>[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2258)   It can reach out to the ends of the imagined universe so any world systems that you would 
<br>[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2270)   imagine you embrace them. 
<br>[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2275)   But it can also shrink down. 
<br>[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2278)   It can shrink down to inhabit the center of every atom. 
<br>[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2288)   I'm speaking metaphorically here. 
<br>[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2292)   So it has been said that poets can see in the dark. 
<br>[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2299)   I think it was Lorca that said that. 
<br>[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2305)   So the South American writer, I could be wrong but I think he said poets can see in the dark, 
<br>[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2312)   he's the one that said it. 
<br>[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2315)   Recent poet is Rainer Maria Wilke, R-I-L-K-E, one of the most amazing poets of all time. 
<br>[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2325)   I don't know what kind of ether he is poetry from. 
<br>[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2332)   He lived like a hundred years ago, right? 
<br>[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2336)   Where did he pull that from to be able to say the things he says? 
<br>[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2345)   It's inexplicable. 
<br>[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2350)   Specifically what he had to say a hundred years ago when Europe was just starting to 
<br>[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2362)   discover Buddhism. 
<br>[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2363)   Just starting, knowledge of Buddhism was rudimentary in Europe in his time. 
<br>[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2372)   He absolutely nailed the essence of the Buddha's enlightenment as it would be interpreted in 
<br>[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2382)   the Japanese Zen tradition. 
<br>[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2385)   Without as far as I know any direct contact with the Japanese Zen tradition and with rather 
<br>[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2391)   little contact with anything about Buddhism. 
<br>[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2398)   How did he do it? 
<br>[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2399)   I don't know. 
<br>[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2401)   But I have a translation of his poem that I made myself from German on my website, Buddha 
<br>[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2412)   in der Gloria, the Buddha in Glory. 
<br>[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2417)   Mitte, alle mitten, Kern, der Kerne, Mandel, die sich einschließt und versüßt. 
<br>[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2428)   Dieses alles, bis an alle Sterne, ist dein Fruchtfleisch. 
<br>[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2436)   Sei gegrüßt. 
<br>[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2439)   Center of all centers, core of cores, almond that enclosed itself to sweeten. 
<br>[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2450)   All of this to the furthest stars is your fruit flesh. 
<br>[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2458)   Hear my greeting. 
<br>[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2460)   He is congratulating the Buddha on the moment of his enlightenment, the morning after he 
<br>[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2467)   did Buddha did yaza, an all night set, was enlightened in the morning when he saw the 
<br>[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2473)   morning star Venus. 
<br>[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2478)   How did he get it? 
<br>[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2480)   How did he know about expansion and contraction? 
<br>[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2483)   And how to link that to the Buddha? 
<br>[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2485)   God, can I remember the rest of it? 
<br>[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2489)   Die du fühlst, wie nicht, mehr an der hängt, und ähnlichen ist deiner Schale, und dort 
<br>[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2502)   steht der starke Saft und Tränen. 
<br>[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2505)   Und von außen hilft ihm ein Gestalter, denn ganz oben werden deine Sonnen voll und glühend 
<br>[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2515)   umgedreht. 
<br>[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2516)   Doch in dir ist schon begonnen, was die Sonnen übersteht. 
<br>[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2521)   I can't believe I remember that. 
<br>[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2524)   See you feel nothing more upon you clinging. 
<br>[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2532)   Your shell is opened wide without a bound. 
<br>[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2539)   The ripe sap endlessly streaming within you, the ripened sap, dort steht der safte und 
<br>[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2555)   tränen. 
<br>[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2556)   Und von außen, and from outside you were helped by a star. 
<br>[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2565)   That's the seeing of the Venus, the morning star, und von außen hilft ihm ein Gestalter, 
<br>[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2572)   denn ganz oben werden deine Sonnen. 
<br>[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2577)   When all around you orbited your stars, voll und glühend umgedreht, all around you orbited 
<br>[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2602)   the sun, doch in dir ist schon begonnen, was die Sonnen übersteht. 
<br>[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2614)   But that which will outlive the stars in you has now begun. 
<br>[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2623)   That's the poem that Roca wrote to describe the Buddha's enlightenment, with almost no 
<br>[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2630)   knowledge of Buddhism. 
<br>[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2633)   I repeat, what ether did he access to pull that out of? 
<br>[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2641)   So center of all center, core of cores, all of this to the farthest stars. 
<br>[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2648)   It's an elastic identity. 
<br>[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2651)   You could also call it a no-self. 
<br>[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2657)   So how does that come about? 
<br>[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2658)   Well, early Buddhism would say when you untangle the strands, then the somethingness of self 
<br>[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2668)   is seen as an illusion. 
<br>[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2670)   And where we left off in the talk last night was I gave the traditional metaphor for that, 
<br>[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2678)   the chariot metaphor from this great scripture called the questions of King Menandros, King 
<br>[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2686)   Belinda, but King Menandros, he was Greek, a Westerner, talking to a arhat way, way, way 
<br>[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2698)   back. 
<br>[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2699)   And it's the dialogue is recorded. 
<br>[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2703)   So the arhat Nagasena, quoting a Buddhist nun named Vajira, said, well, it's when you 
<br>[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2717)   dissect a chariot, there's just the parts. 
<br>[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2721)   There's no thing called a chariot. 
<br>[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2722)   So when you dissect I amness, there's just rupa, vedana, sanshya, samskara, vijnana. 
<br>[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2730)   There's just matter, feeling, thought, subliminal habit forces, and consciousness. 
<br>[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2747)   And no self. 
<br>[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2748)   There's just those elements, and there's no self. 
<br>[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2751)   In another place in Buddhist literature, it's not quite the whole picture of self, but it's 
<br>[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2759)   self in terms of identifying with the body, saying I am body. 
<br>[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2765)   There's this extraordinary passage where the Buddha says, just as a skillful butcher would 
<br>[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2775)   carve up a steer, and at some point the perception steer goes away, and the perception meat arises. 
<br>[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2795)   So in the same way, the skillful meditator deconstructs the body into earth, water, air, 
<br>[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2805)   and fire, four elements, and the perception I am a body disappears, and the perception 
<br>[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2813)   there are just these elements arises. 
<br>[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2817)   So we see in early Buddhism that the notion of untangling strands in order to eliminate 
<br>[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2825)   an emergent property was not just applied to the five aggregates. 
<br>[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2833)   It was also applied to the perception of the physicality of the body, and the deconstructive 
<br>[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2845)   strands were the primitive chemistry of that time. 
<br>[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2851)   But it sort of works, and it actually does work. 
<br>[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2855)   You can do it. 
<br>[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2856)   Maybe just for the fun of it, one of these days I'll give a guide. 
<br>[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2860)   I've actually done this with people. 
<br>[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2862)   I've done the old-fashioned four-element deconstruction of somethingness of your body. 
<br>[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2870)   You can totally do it. 
<br>[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2872)   Even though we know that as far as physics goes, that's a pretty primitive view of physics, 
<br>[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2880)   but it still works. 
<br>[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2882)   What you do is, because it's based on experience, they state it as though it's based on objective 
<br>[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2891)   science, but it's based on sensory experience. 
<br>[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2894)   So you tune into your body, and you find all the bones and the hard parts. 
<br>[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2903)   Well, it's the earth element, right? 
<br>[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2905)   So you tune into those and get a really good sense of that. 
<br>[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2909)   And then you get a sense of anything that's sort of airy, like your breath or other flatulence 
<br>[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2916)   or things like that. 
<br>[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2917)   And then you get the circulation of the watery parts, and then you can feel warmth in different 
<br>[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2924)   parts. 
<br>[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2925)   And you just tune into the putative characteristics of the four elements, and you sort of get 
<br>[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2934)   those sensory strands all separated out. 
<br>[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2938)   And sure enough, you start to experience like, well, there's just the four elements. 
<br>[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2943)   There's not a thing called a body here. 
<br>[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2945)   So the method of divide and conquer is not limited to the five aggregates. 
<br>[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2952)   And in fact, I vastly prefer the three inner elements. 
<br>[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2956)   Occam's razor, okay? 
<br>[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2959)   If three will do the trick, why not have three instead of four or five, et cetera, et cetera? 
<br>[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2969)   So I pointed out that untangling mental image, mental talk, and body emotion is, my friends 
<br>[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2979)   at Google would say it's a non-trivial issue, okay? 
<br>[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2985)   I love this jargon. 
<br>[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2987)   Instead of saying significant or hard, they say non-trivial. 
<br>[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=2993)   So this is non-trivial because each of these systems is scaled. 
<br>[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3006)   If you look into image space, there's the surface images, but those trigger subtle association 
<br>[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3013)   images. 
<br>[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3014)   And each of those subtle associations triggers a whole bunch of subtler associations. 
<br>[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3020)   The bulk of all of this is below the threshold of ordinary awareness, but with your detection 
<br>[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3026)   skills and your concentration skills, you can actually detect it. 
<br>[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3031)   Not in terms of the content, the content is too fugacious and parallel. 
<br>[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3039)   Fugacious means it just passes too quickly and it's massively parallel. 
<br>[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3044)   But you can detect the aggregate, the state, like the state variable. 
<br>[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3052)   You can sort of take the temperature, you can be aware of average kinetic energy as 
<br>[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3057)   it changes. 
<br>[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3058)   I'm making a metaphor here, okay, but it's sort of analogous to taking pressure or temperature. 
<br>[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3064)   You can see the overall waveform of the subconscious mind in real time. 
<br>[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3073)   Underneath surface mental talk is subtler talk, underneath that is subtler talk. 
<br>[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3078)   Same deal, but you can watch the sort of changing contour of the system. 
<br>[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3086)   As with the body motion. 
<br>[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3088)   So, untangling is not just untangling the surface strands, it's untangling all the different 
<br>[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3095)   strands until all the levels of visual process, inner visual processing are all sort of nicely 
<br>[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3102)   over here and all the levels of auditory thinking are over here, the emotional body is over 
<br>[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3110)   here. 
<br>[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3111)   At all levels, they're completely separated out. 
<br>[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3114)   What happens at that point is that the emergent property of somethingness disappears. 
<br>[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3125)   So as I say, the traditional metaphor is the chariot thing. 
<br>[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3133)   Where we left off last night is I said I find that metaphor unconvincing. 
<br>[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3141)   I know it refers to an experience that is absolutely true and very important, but to 
<br>[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3149)   explain it in terms of sort of taking apart a chariot doesn't seem quite convincing. 
<br>[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3159)   So let me give you something that I think is closer to what's going on, a closer metaphor. 
<br>[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3168)   Now, you've got to hear loud and clear, this is just a metaphor. 
<br>[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3172)   I'm not saying this is the mechanism, but I think it's closer to the mechanism. 
<br>[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3178)   We don't know the mechanism yet scientifically. 
<br>[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3182)   Be very interesting when we do though. 
<br>[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3185)   So here's something that's a little closer. 
<br>[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3187)   Most of you have heard me say this a million times, but I'll say it again. 
<br>[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3192)   So you have an old-fashioned TV set with a CRT, cathode ray tube, not the flat screen 
<br>[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3200)   kind, but the old-fashioned kind. 
<br>[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3207)   There's like a test pattern and there's a big white area. 
<br>[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3215)   I say there is no white on that screen and you say, are you crazy? 
<br>[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3223)   Just look, it's mostly white. 
<br>[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3226)   And I say, are you sure? 
<br>[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3230)   Let's take this magnifying glass. 
<br>[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3233)   We agree that this magnifying glass does two things. 
<br>[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3236)   It enlarges, but that's not what's important. 
<br>[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3241)   It resolves. 
<br>[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3244)   It takes things that for the naked eye fall together, but that are truly separate. 
<br>[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3252)   And it allows you to actually see that separation. 
<br>[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3254)   That's called the resolution power of the lens. 
<br>[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3258)   So we know that it doesn't do anything else. 
<br>[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3261)   It doesn't add or subtract to what's there. 
<br>[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3265)   And it's really not the magnification we're interested in, it's the resolution, the clarity. 
<br>[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3272)   And now I want you to look at that white with this magnifying glass. 
<br>[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3277)   And as you get closer and closer and closer, what's going to happen? 
<br>[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3282)   The impression white disappears as the reality, little red, green, blue dots arises. 
<br>[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3294)   So what happened to the white? 
<br>[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3299)   Well it was sort of never there to begin with. 
<br>[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3303)   But it was actually, because if you don't look carefully, it's there. 
<br>[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3309)   But if you look very, very carefully without changing anything at all, now it's not there. 
<br>[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3315)   It's just red, green, and blue. 
<br>[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3318)   Something like that occurs with inner see, hear, feel. 
<br>[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3327)   When you're not looking carefully, it seems like there's a thing inside you called a self 
<br>[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3333)   that you're imprisoned in these thoughts and emotions. 
<br>[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3338)   It's not just that it's a thing, it's actually a prison that constrains your identity. 
<br>[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3347)   But when you finally see it clearly enough, the somethingness goes away and the incarceration 
<br>[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3358)   potential goes away. 
<br>[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3361)   Or another way to put it is it was never there to begin with. 
<br>[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3366)   You just now can see that. 
<br>[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3369)   An undesirable emergent property that's quite compelling vanishes simply through clarity. 
<br>[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3383)   That's the core insight of early Buddhism. 
<br>[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3387)   That's knowing yourself as a sensory system. 
<br>[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3392)   So it may sound rather cold and not very relevant to things. 
<br>[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3397)   So, oh, I know myself as a sensory system. 
<br>[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3400)   But actually it's really, really big. 
<br>[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3404)   Now is that to know yourself at the deepest level? 
<br>[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3411)   Well no, I would say that there's a deeper level of knowing yourself. 
<br>[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3417)   And we can actually extend the metaphor. 
<br>[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3420)   Okay, red, green, and blue pixels. 
<br>[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3423)   Once again, do understand, just a metaphor, just a way of thinking about things. 
<br>[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3427)   Red, green, and blue pixels. 
<br>[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3430)   What are they? 
<br>[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3432)   Well, actually they're radiant electromagnetic energy in the visual spectrum. 
<br>[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3440)   That's how I perceive them. 
<br>[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3442)   So if we think of, it's light. 
<br>[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3446)   So from that perspective, it's just they're different frequencies of the same thing. 
<br>[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3454)   What's light? 
<br>[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3455)   Well, that's a very interesting question from a physics point of view. 
<br>[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3461)   But the metaphor is actually quite nice. 
<br>[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3468)   Because if you think of red, green, and blue as just different frequencies of the same 
<br>[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3475)   thing, they're just part of this spectrum of radiant electromagnetic energy. 
<br>[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3484)   Well then, there's a kind of unification there. 
<br>[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3490)   So if you look more carefully at the actual substance of inner see, hear, feel, sure enough, 
<br>[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3505)   it's sort of like vibrating space. 
<br>[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3512)   And in fact, outer sight, sound, touch has the same quality. 
<br>[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3520)   So it all becomes an integrated arabesque of energy. 
<br>[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3526)   Vibrant, but sort of transparent. 
<br>[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3534)   And then you come to realize that what's churning those vibrations, fermenting them, fomenting 
<br>[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3545)   them, is that with each sensory and motor arising, there's a kind of effortless efflux 
<br>[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3557)   and a simultaneous effortless influx that churns those vibrations into existence the 
<br>[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3565)   way foam is born in the cleft of a hokusai wave. 
<br>[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3569)   You know, there's that famous picture of Mount Fuji seen in the cleft of a wave, right, by 
<br>[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3577)   the Japanese ukiyo-e artist, Hokusai. 
<br>[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3583)   So the expanding wave and a simultaneous contracting wave, there's a shear, and in that shear is 
<br>[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3596)   born vibration. 
<br>[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3599)   And that vibration, if it coagulates, creates the inner, the sense that there's a material 
<br>[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3611)   world on the outside and a thing called self on the inside. 
<br>[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3617)   But if you see it just as it is, there is just this effortless efflux and reflux. 
<br>[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3630)   Like a fountain, a formless fountain of youth that's constantly gushing and gathering, its 
<br>[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3639)   center is wherever your attention goes, and its perimeter encompasses the whole self and 
<br>[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3648)   scene. 
<br>[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3653)   That is the dynamic side of the source. 
<br>[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3658)   That is the deepest experience of the Dharmakaya in terms of its activity. 
<br>[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3666)   However, that activity comes from and returns to an absolute rest that always pervades it. 
<br>[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3682)   So it's eternally, it's a kind of eternal fountain of youth, a formless womb that moment 
<br>[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3691)   by moment gives rise to self and world as it activates. 
<br>[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3700)   But it arises from and returns to and is peppered by Shalom Bimromav, the peace of God's own 
<br>[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3713)   heaven. 
<br>[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3714)   There's this prayer, I remember it vividly from being a little boy. 
<br>[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3723)   We in synagogue, Oseh Shalom Bimromav, hu ya'aseh shalom, aleinu ve'al kol Yisrael, 
<br>[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3732)   ve'ibru, amen. 
<br>[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3735)   May the one that creates Asiyah, it's a creation, may the one that creates the peace of his 
<br>[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3743)   own heaven give peace to you and all of Israel. 
<br>[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3747)   Of course, for me, Yisrael doesn't mean a country, it's anybody who struggles for the 
<br>[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3755)   Lord, Yisrael, it has a meaning in Hebrew, struggle to experience El, the source. 
<br>[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3767)   That's my interpretation of Israel anyway. 
<br>[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3770)   Other people have other interpretations, I'm sure. 
<br>[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3774)   But I've chosen that, it means sanga, okay? 
<br>[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3778)   Not a race, not a country. 
<br>[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3781)   So sometimes I'll sing that, that's what I mean. 
<br>[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3789)   The shalom, the peace that comes with completeness, shalem, shlemut, that's what the Christian 
<br>[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3804)   poet T.S. 
<br>[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3805)   Eliot called the still point of the turning world that I quoted from last night, at the 
<br>[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3810)   still point of the turning world. 
<br>[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3814)   Their movement from nor towards the restful part is when the movement in and out ceases. 
<br>[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3823)   When the movement in and out starts, well, that's when the creative activity occurs. 
<br>[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3833)   In the Jewish mystical tradition, that pulling apart of hesed and gvura, of contraction and 
<br>[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3843)   expansion, they even have terms for it, it's just amazing. 
<br>[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3847)   It's amazing. 
<br>[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3849)   It's called tzimtzum, it creates a space. 
<br>[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3854)   And then that space vibrates. 
<br>[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3859)   So that's what happens for everyone in each moment of inner and outer seer feel. 
<br>[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3873)   And in each act of speech or body movement or thought. 
<br>[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3878)   That's the primordial great perfection. 
<br>[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3884)   To touch it is to know true love. 
<br>[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3891)   So that's to understand yourself at the deepest possible level. 
<br>[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3902)   And it's if that becomes a moment by moment reality, then it's quite easy to have this 
<br>[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3917)   sense of wanting to, of kinship with everyone, including people you don't like. 
<br>[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3933)   You relate to flowers, but you can also relate to garbage cans. 
<br>[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3938)   You can relate to your personal heroes, but you can also relate to people you fear or 
<br>[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3952)   dislike or embarrass you. 
<br>[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3960)   The trick is to realize that that's always first, before the reactivity can arise. 
<br>[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3971)   There's nothing wrong with judgments. 
<br>[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3973)   I have nothing wrong with judgment, okay? 
<br>[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3975)   I definitely have opinions. 
<br>[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3979)   I like certain politicians, I don't like other politicians, okay? 
<br>[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3985)   I have my opinions. 
<br>[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=3988)   But I know for sure, before my opinion arises, when I first look or hear that person, the 
<br>[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=4005)   first thing that I experience is the source loving them into existence. 
<br>[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=4014)   That does not preclude me having opinions and judgments. 
<br>[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=4019)   It's just, it makes a very different context to things. 
<br>[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIQsQwls-fo&t=4027)   Amor primero.
