title: "How to do 'AUTO-WALK' ~ Stephanie Nash"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=0)   Hi, I'm Stephanie Nash and Shinzen has asked me to make a video and post it here where 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=11)   I share how I taught auto-walk at a retreat of his that I was co-teaching in June of 2019. 
<br>[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=22)   He loved how quickly and easily people seemed to get it, so for what it's worth, I offer 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=29)   it here. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=30)   You can think of this as a sensitizing exercise to get a feel for the spontaneity of the automatic 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=38)   or motor movements that we engage in all day long and also to better appreciate the effortlessness 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=46)   and bounce. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=48)   Okay, so we learn through contrast. 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=53)   Contrast helps us make distinction. 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=55)   It's much easier to notice the ease that's there in your arm if you first tense and release 
<br>[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=60)   and then compared to the tension, the ease is quite palpable. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=65)   So in a similar way, I have set up a contrast between auto-walk and mindful walking or walking 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=72)   meditation to hopefully help make your experience of the spontaneity of auto-walk be more palpable 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=80)   for you. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=82)   Okay, let's begin. 
<br>[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=84)   Okay, so find an area that you can move around in, whether it's one little six-foot patch, 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=90)   whether you're outside with trees, whether you're in a room with a bunch of chairs, doesn't 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=95)   matter. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=96)   Just find a place where you can do some kind of movement without running into anybody. 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=102)   And when you're ready, close your eyes and take a nice deep breath in and a big pleasurable 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=107)   sigh out and just let the body be relaxed and present and feel what the body feels like 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=116)   standing here now, if the body's balancing here on this place. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=121)   And you'll feel the arms hanging at the side. 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=124)   You'll feel the pressure of the weight of the body on the feet as you contact the floor. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=133)   And then allow your weight to move over to one foot, so you're leaning over to one side. 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=140)   And you'll feel the weight more heavily on that side. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=143)   And then slowly shift and feel the shift of weight in the middle. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=148)   It's equal pressure on both feet and then move over to the other side. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=153)   And just play with shifting your weight from the left foot to the right foot, feeling that 
<br>[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=160)   shift of weight back and forth. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=163)   And you might notice different muscles engage in the legs. 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=168)   Notice if you're holding your breath. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=169)   See if you can not hold your breath. 
<br>[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=173)   Let your breathing just go as you're shifting the weight and feeling all the sensory experience 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=179)   involved in the weight shifting from the left to the right and back to the left. 
<br>[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=187)   And then come to the center. 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=190)   And slowly open your eyes a little or a lot. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=193)   You can keep your gaze down. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=195)   You can keep your gaze forward. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=196)   And we're going to begin a classic walking meditation, which would be feeling in the 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=202)   same way we just felt the shift back and forth. 
<br>[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=204)   You're going to feel the lift of, say, if you start with your right leg, you're going 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=209)   to feel the muscles involved in lifting the leg. 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=212)   The leg's going to swing out. 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=214)   And then there's going to be a shift of weight forward as the weight goes from the back foot 
<br>[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=218)   to the first foot, probably the heel first and then the toe. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=222)   Feel that shift of weight. 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=224)   And as you get there, the back leg lifts up and it swings forward. 
<br>[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=230)   So continue with it. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=231)   It's like slow motion walking where you're really feeling the contact of the foot on 
<br>[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=237)   the ground. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=238)   You're feeling the weight come down onto it, the shift of weight, muscles involved in lifting. 
<br>[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=244)   So it'll be lift, swing, place, shift. 
<br>[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=248)   So just play for a moment. 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=251)   And this is a classic. 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=252)   There are many ways to teach walking meditation. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=255)   I tend to do something a little more fluid than the one, two, three, four step. 
<br>[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=259)   But I want to just take us to something that's quite tangible and that you're probably familiar 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=263)   with. 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=264)   So lifting, swinging, stepping, feel that shift of weight. 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=272)   Just keep doing this, really tuning into that. 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=276)   See if you can still be breathing as you're doing it. 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=279)   You might notice the hands might be doing weird things as you're focusing on the feet. 
<br>[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=283)   See if you can keep it relaxed. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=286)   And to continue with this, you could press pause now and continue exploring the walking 
<br>[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=293)   meditation for as long as you like. 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=296)   But basically we're noticing the weight shift. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=299)   We're noticing the sensations in the legs, the arms may or may not be moving depending 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=304)   on how fast you're going. 
<br>[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=306)   You're going to feel the contact on the floor and the rolling through the foot, usually 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=312)   on the heel to the toe. 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=314)   So just keep exploring this walking meditation. 
<br>[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=326)   And then when you're ready, pause for a moment. 
<br>[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=331)   And now let go of that and just walk normally. 
<br>[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=338)   Walk normally around the room, so at a quicker tempo. 
<br>[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=343)   So that little six foot space might not do. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=345)   You might have to go around chairs or wherever you go. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=349)   And here's your assignment. 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=352)   As you're walking more quickly and with tempo, think a thought. 
<br>[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=357)   Either it's a memory or a plan. 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=360)   So either remember what you had for breakfast or something that happened today, something 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=365)   that's quite fresh in your mind that you can replay and just keep thinking that memory, 
<br>[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=369)   that thought. 
<br>[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=371)   Or you can think about something you're planning to do. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=374)   Something could be something you want in life, just something that you can, a thought you 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=378)   can just really keep going. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=379)   So you've got to keep going with that thought, whether it's a memory in the past or a plan 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=384)   in the future. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=385)   And as you're walking around now, now it's not mindfully feeling it. 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=390)   Just walk as fast as you can. 
<br>[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=393)   Don't run into anything and keep thinking. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=396)   Don't stop the thinking. 
<br>[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=397)   So just do that for a while. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=398)   And if you want, you can press pause here, but I'm going to wait for a few moments for 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=401)   that. 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=403)   Keep walking. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=404)   Keep that thought going. 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=406)   Just keep thinking as you're walking and don't run into anything. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=410)   That's it. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=411)   Think, walk, don't run into anything. 
<br>[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=414)   Just keep doing that. 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=416)   And you may end up, and if you have a room of people, you might have to get out of the 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=420)   way of people. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=421)   You might have to duck under something. 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=423)   You might have to scoot around a chair. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=426)   The more quickly you're going, the more agility you'll need. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=430)   But keep the thinking. 
<br>[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=432)   Don't stop that thinking about the memory or what you're planning. 
<br>[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=441)   And as you keep the thinking going, thinking, walking, not running into things, thinking, 
<br>[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=447)   walking, not running into things. 
<br>[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=450)   And then when you're ready, drop the thinking and just notice that your body hasn't run 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=457)   into anything. 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=458)   How did it know to not run into anything? 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=462)   And just notice that the body knows how to walk, knows how to balance, knows how to shift 
<br>[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=466)   weight, and you don't have to tune into it. 
<br>[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=469)   It's like a free ride. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=470)   It's like the body knows what to do. 
<br>[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=472)   So just kind of enjoy the free ride. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=475)   Continue walking and just notice the free ride. 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=479)   Arms might be moving at the side naturally. 
<br>[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=483)   The torso knows how to shift, to turn, to balance. 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=487)   Your focus can be kind of even coverage, just kind of holding this whole event, this kind 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=493)   of global event happening that's just happening automatically and you're just getting this 
<br>[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=499)   free ride. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=500)   So your attention can be across the whole body or it could even be beyond the body. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=506)   Maybe you're noticing patterns. 
<br>[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=508)   But the main thing is to just notice the just happeningness. 
<br>[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=514)   It knows what to do. 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=515)   There's a bouncy, expressive form of movement. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=522)   We tend to focus on what we need to accomplish, what we have to do, what are the results of 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=529)   our actions going to be. 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=530)   And maybe along the way, if we're mindfully trained, we're also tuning into sensory experience. 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=535)   But what if we notice the things that happen automatically and enjoy that light ease of 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=542)   them? 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=543)   We can do this when we walk, wash dishes, chew, drive, any movement activity, yoga, 
<br>[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=550)   qigong, sports, playing musical instruments. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=555)   Many Olympic athletes talk about letting go of the thought before they start and just 
<br>[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=559)   letting the body do what it knows to do. 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=562)   So we can enjoy this conditioned motor experience that the body knows what to do. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=569)   So play with the ease of that, I like to call it the free ride of auto walk or of auto anything. 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=579)   And tune into that light, bouncy, just happeningness of your movement that you can enjoy without 
<br>[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=590)   effort. 
<br>[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=593)   I hope that's a helpful introduction to the technique of auto walk from Shinzen Young's 
<br>[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABdQrLlqcS8&t=601)   Unified Mindfulness System. 
<br>
