title: "How Cho used Shinzen's techniques to work through pain"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=0)   Can you give an example of maybe a specific way in which you used the techniques for any 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=19)   specific issue? 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=21)   Yes, I found out recently or in the last couple of years that I am either allergic to codeine 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=31)   or it doesn't like me, whatever. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=35)   And I was having some back issues and my doctor prescribed codeine for me in a Tylenol 3. 
<br>[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=43)   And I had said to her, I don't think I can take codeine because years ago when I was 
<br>[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=49)   experiencing gallbladder problems, I started having extreme stomach issues with it. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=54)   And she said, oh, that was probably your gallbladder. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=57)   Well, it wasn't. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=59)   In the middle of the night, my stomach went into an extreme spasm and I immediately started 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=67)   doing my practice. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=69)   It escalated and yes, it became much more difficult. 
<br>[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=73)   I actually sent my husband downstairs to get a CD that was how to deal with pain or like 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=80)   I wanted Shinsen to guide me. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=82)   And while it was extremely difficult, I think it really, really helped. 
<br>[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=86)   I spoke with him after that because even after my years of meditation, I thought I could 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=93)   do better at it. 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=95)   But he was very kind and said, you know, until some of these really, really big issues hit 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=101)   us, you don't know what you would have been if you didn't have the practice. 
<br>[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=106)   Can you give an example of what you specifically did on that night? 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=111)   I did two things. 
<br>[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=114)   I did the focus away from the pain and I also focused on. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=119)   I needed both. 
<br>[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=121)   Shinsen's techniques, when you're focusing away, I was looking for restful spaces within 
<br>[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=127)   my body, within my talk space. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=131)   I was focusing away from the pain by trying to find the relaxed rest spot so that the 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=139)   pain wasn't so intense. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=141)   And then when it would get to the point where the focus, I had to focus on it, then I was 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=146)   using focus on the pain and I was watching the intensity, the shape, whether it was sharp 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=155)   or dull, whether it moved, was there a color to it that I could focus on to sort of, and 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=162)   that, you know, that allows the pain to spread more and be less intense in one area. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=170)   That's what I did. 
<br>[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=174)   I ended up going to the emergency anyway, but. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=179)   Everything worked out. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBI3CRqiSAo&t=181)   So, yes, it's a coding, something you just have to work out of your system.
