<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=0)   So you're off and running, in four hours you've got the beginnings of a mindfulness practice. 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=11)   And then the core curriculum is set up so that there are sort of level one programs 
<br>[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=18)   in the five ways and there's a part two that's sort of like a more detailed, deeper version. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=24)   And you take that the next month. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=27)   So after you take part one, one month, and part two the next month, now you know that 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=32)   entire way. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=34)   So that in theory, in say ten months, if you were to participate every month, you would 
<br>[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=39)   have learned all five of them. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=41)   But you may not want to learn all five, you may want to just learn one of them and stay 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=45)   with that. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=46)   So we have the intro, we have core curriculum that teaches the part one and part two of 
<br>[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=52)   each of the five ways. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=54)   And then we have, for people once they learn those techniques, they have deepening retreats, 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=61)   sharpening retreats, and special application retreats. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=65)   The sharpening retreats, I guide them interactively with special exercises that sharpen their 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=72)   ability and then the theme retreats, they apply the techniques to certain themes like 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=77)   dealing with pain or dealing with emotions or dealing with behavior change or decision 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=83)   making, any practical, many practical applications that they can have. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=87)   Wow, that's interesting. 
<br>[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=88)   So, yeah. 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=89)   So, it's a very carefully organized curriculum and basically I would say to summarize it, 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=99)   and it doesn't cost appreciable money, in fact if you don't have money it doesn't cost 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=102)   anything. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=103)   And we tell you how to get really cheap long distance calling. 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=109)   So what happens is people call in, they're socializing, then there's an hour and a half 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=113)   guidance around the theme, which may involve Q&A. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=117)   Then people hang up. 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=118)   So people can, you're guiding but people can actually ask you questions. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=122)   They can interact with me in the group setting and then after an hour and a half everyone 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=128)   hangs up and they practice on their own for an hour. 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=131)   During that period of time they can stretch and get coffee. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=135)   Oh, so you're not sitting there for four hours straight. 
<br>[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=138)   But also during that period of time they can call me personally. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=141)   90 people? 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=143)   No, typically what happens is there's about 60 people and about one out of ten has a need 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=150)   during that program to talk to me and they have my private number. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=154)   We give out, when you register, my private telephone number that goes with the TERF. 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=161)   So it's usually about 10% of the people need to talk to me and I can usually handle the 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=168)   most of those in that hour period. 
<br>[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=170)   So you actually get a chance to talk, if you really need it, one-on-one with me. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=175)   If I back up then I make an appointment with you to talk to you later that day or very 
<br>[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=180)   soon afterwards. 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=181)   So it serves as the potential for touching base personally with a teacher any month you 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=188)   need that. 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=189)   And then after that hour? 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=190)   After that hour they come back and we have a group Q&A for a half an hour and then they... 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=199)   Everybody hears, everybody asks questions. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=200)   Everybody hears the other's questions. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=202)   And then there's another hour of guidance and then there's a little more socializing. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=209)   And four hours have passed and you've had four hours of a retreat-like environment. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=215)   All the features that you'd get at a residential retreat, a talk, guidance, chance to work 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=221)   on your own, chance to talk to a teacher, chance to hear other people's questions and 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=226)   experience. 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=227)   It's all packed into four tightly organized hours. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=231)   Don't have to leave your home, don't have to leave your family, don't have to mess with 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=234)   your work schedule. 
<br>[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=238)   Anybody can get four hours on some weekend. 
<br>[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=241)   Now I've got a question, if I've never meditated before and I'm going to be doing one of these 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=246)   four hour retreats, do I have to get those cushions people have or how do I know how 
<br>[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=252)   to sit? 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=254)   If you go to basicmindfulness.org there's a document which is about the posture. 
<br>[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=261)   Oh, okay. 
<br>[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=262)   So I don't have to like burn incense or... 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=264)   No, there's no particular environment needed. 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=267)   I mean it's nice if it's quiet but it's not required. 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=271)   You mean if kids are running in and out? 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=273)   That doesn't matter because that's the whole point in mindfulness, you deal with what is. 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=278)   So you don't have to burn incense. 
<br>[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=281)   It's nice if you can get off and it's a quiet environment but if you can't, that's just 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV8neHohagk&t=286)   part of what we work with.
