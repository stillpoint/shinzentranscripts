title: "THE QUICKEST WAY TO ENLIGHTENMENT ~ Shinzen Young"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=0)   Sometimes people ask me, is there a really quick way to enlightenment? 
<br>[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=10)   There's got to be a quicker way. 
<br>[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=11)   A lot of you know what's coming because this is a standard story that I tell, which is, 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=20)   well, are you sure you want to know? 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=26)   Maybe you won't like what you hear. 
<br>[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=29)   Yeah, I can tell you some pretty quick ways to transform deeply. 
<br>[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=41)   Strong determination sitting. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=44)   It's a classic. 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=46)   I won't say that every master has done it, but I would say that the great majority of 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=54)   people that come to the master level on this path have done a lot of strong determination 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=63)   sitting. 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=64)   So, what does that mean? 
<br>[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=66)   That means that you sit down and you say, okay, for the next hour or the next 90 minutes 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=75)   or two hours or three or four or whatever, three days, not going to voluntarily move. 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=85)   So I know the prospect of something like that seems horrific. 
<br>[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=91)   You might not imagine yourself doing that. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=96)   Well, first of all, I said it could just be an hour or 90 minutes, okay? 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=102)   It doesn't have to be three days. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=107)   Secondly, even if it was four hours or eight hours, this is not so extravagantly unrelated 
<br>[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=126)   to experiences that normal human beings have. 
<br>[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=130)   In fact, I would suggest to you that at least half of all human beings that ever lived have 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=143)   been through an experience comparable in intensity. 
<br>[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=148)   Do you get what I'm talking about? 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=157)   Sitting for eight hours and breaking through a posture is not more intense than giving 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=164)   birth to a baby. 
<br>[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=165)   If you've done that, okay. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=166)   Now, of course, it's a different circumstance. 
<br>[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=169)   So, I mean, first of all, there's no way out. 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=175)   Secondly, there's a lot to distract and yes, nowadays there are medications and so forth. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=182)   But the way most people had to give birth to babies for most of humanity's history, 
<br>[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=190)   I think it was nature's way to bring that person to a permanent transcendence. 
<br>[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=200)   Sort of makes sense, right? 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=202)   You're doing the activity of the source, expanding and contracting. 
<br>[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=208)   It's interesting. 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=210)   I talked about the Sundance yesterday, native people. 
<br>[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=215)   So the story that's told among the Lakota Sioux is that originally Sundancing was for 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=224)   men only. 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=225)   Nowadays, it's women, even children, actually. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=234)   The men wanted to know what it was like to give birth. 
<br>[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=240)   So if you look at the symbolism of the Sundance, the men wear skirts like women and you're 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=251)   attached by a tether, pierced, which is symbolic of the umbilical cord. 
<br>[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=260)   And then you have to break loose and that's like being born, et cetera, like a new birth. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=269)   Actually, in the old days, after their fourth year of Sundancing, they considered that they 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=276)   had died and were a completely new person and they actually gave away all their possessions, 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=285)   like everything. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=287)   All their teepees and ponies and everything and they just started from scratch as a new 
<br>[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=296)   person. 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=297)   Okay, so even though it sort of sounds like really far out there, it's actually no more 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=304)   than what at least half of humans do. 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=311)   But the good news is strong determination sitting, you can gradually work up to. 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=316)   You train yourself slowly to be able to do this kind of thing. 
<br>[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=321)   So there's one absolute rule. 
<br>[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=330)   Do not, do not, do not physically damage the body. 
<br>[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=336)   So how are you going to know if you're physically damaging the body? 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=340)   Well remember you gradually train yourself to do this, right? 
<br>[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=344)   It's a slow training. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=345)   So you sit for an hour, you got some pain, you get up, it goes away, you're okay, you 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=352)   haven't damaged the body. 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=354)   Then you add five minutes, five minutes, five minutes, and as long as you're getting up 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=360)   and after a few minutes you're okay, then you're okay. 
<br>[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=365)   I can assure you that with rare exceptions, most people can sit down for four hours and 
<br>[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=373)   not move and get up and they haven't like damaged any joints or anything like that. 
<br>[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=378)   But you gradually sort of learn how to do this. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=382)   Oh by the way, your legs falling asleep isn't going to damage anything. 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=388)   And it's not, you're not cutting off circulation so much, it's more pressure on nerves that 
<br>[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=395)   causes that paresthesia thing and that, as you notice, disappears as soon as you get 
<br>[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=403)   up. 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=404)   There might occasionally be exceptions where people have neurological or circulatory issues. 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=410)   So if you wonder about that, check it with a doctor. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=415)   Usually it's not that big a deal. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=419)   The main danger in your legs falling asleep is not massive necrosis that you might be 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=427)   fantasizing, the tissues are dying. 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=430)   The main danger is if you try to get up too quickly, your legs will not hold you and you 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=437)   fall. 
<br>[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=438)   I've seen some really far out, you know, people that didn't know that, like in Zen, like the 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=445)   clackers go, you know, and it's like, okay, everybody jumps up and they just like do a 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=451)   somersault across the Zen dome, you know. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=455)   So yeah, you have to get up slowly. 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=458)   So what's involved in a strong determination sitting? 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=464)   Well, you're going to have four things arise. 
<br>[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=470)   You're going to have physical sensations and those are going to get more and more and more 
<br>[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=477)   intense for sure. 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=480)   And then you're going to have your thoughts and emotions and your will and your desire 
<br>[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=486)   and your judgments arising moment by moment reactively to that. 
<br>[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=492)   So that's a pretty big object. 
<br>[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=494)   That's the whole mind-body-self. 
<br>[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=496)   That's why if you can have a complete experience of that, it's a powerful transcendence. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=504)   And that's why, as I say, not everyone that becomes a master, but in Asian style training, 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=513)   an awful lot of people that become masters, they do this. 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=522)   So what's going to happen? 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=524)   You start to get physical discomfort. 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=528)   Now what I usually do, this is my own personal strategy. 
<br>[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=534)   You'll find whatever strategy works for you if you decide to do things like this. 
<br>[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=540)   But my personal strategy is to start by detecting the global spread of the pain rather than 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=549)   going immediately to the local intensity. 
<br>[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=554)   That's sort of the sensory clarity skill. 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=561)   After you get really intimate with the body, you realize that the body is like a pond and 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=568)   not always, but quite often when there's a local physical or emotional splash, there's 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=575)   a global ripple. 
<br>[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=579)   And one of the options within the noting apparatus is what I call zooming. 
<br>[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=587)   You can zoom in, you can zoom out, you can zoom both ways. 
<br>[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=591)   So zooming both ways means that you thrust your attention into the local splash, so that's 
<br>[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=598)   contracted, but at the same time you spread your attention over the whole body. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=604)   So you sort of zoom in and out at the same time. 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=607)   Now what that does is that greases the rails, so to speak, for sensations to dissipate in 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=620)   the volume of the body. 
<br>[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=621)   It's analogous to Boyle's law in physical chemistry. 
<br>[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=627)   Pressure is inversely proportional to volume if pressure is analogous to suffering. 
<br>[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=636)   So here's how that works. 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=638)   So when you zoom into a local intensity, of course that becomes very salient. 
<br>[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=645)   It intensifies even more. 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=648)   But at the same time you're zooming out. 
<br>[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=651)   Now one of two things will happen. 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=654)   Either there will be conscious sensations that are spreading from that local intensity 
<br>[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=661)   and with the zooming out you'll be able to detect that and open up to it and facilitate 
<br>[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=668)   that. 
<br>[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=670)   The other possibility is that actually there aren't conscious spreading sensations. 
<br>[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=676)   And that's fine. 
<br>[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=677)   It's not always the case that there are conscious spreading sensations. 
<br>[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=682)   But it is almost always the case, with rare exception, that there are subconscious spreading 
<br>[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=691)   sensations going on. 
<br>[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=693)   Now an important principle in mindfulness is we only ask you to attend to what is available 
<br>[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=699)   in conscious experience. 
<br>[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=705)   So don't worry if you don't detect any of that subliminal spread. 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=709)   But here's the subtlety of the technique, the sort of cleverness of the option. 
<br>[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=717)   If you spread your awareness over the whole body, zoom out while you zoom in, then even 
<br>[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=726)   if there's not a conscious awareness of the spread of the sensation, the movement of your 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=734)   attention over the whole body greases the rails for the subconscious processing to spread 
<br>[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=745)   without impedance. 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=747)   You may not consciously be aware, but you're giving the very subtle spreading tendencies 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=756)   of the body what they need to dissipate the density of things. 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=762)   So that's one possible strategy for doing it. 
<br>[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=769)   So anyway, I tend to sort of try to get the local splash and the global ripple. 
<br>[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=778)   And then at some point, I start to freak out. 
<br>[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=784)   So where does the freak out come? 
<br>[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=786)   Well, the freak out is in the subjective system. 
<br>[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=791)   I start to go, oh my God, oh my God, no, no, okay. 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=796)   And I start to get disconcerting images of being stabbed and burned and what have you. 
<br>[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=807)   And then the emotions start to come up in the body. 
<br>[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=811)   There's a subtle hint of teariness. 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=816)   In here, there's a kind of cold fear thing that sort of pervades the body. 
<br>[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=827)   Subtle, but subtle is significant. 
<br>[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=832)   Those see in, hear in, feel in reactions are natural. 
<br>[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=839)   If you contract them and unblock them, they won't be a problem. 
<br>[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=846)   If you can't, then they're going to cross multiply with the physical sensations. 
<br>[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=853)   And so instead of see in plus hear in plus feel in plus feel out, you're going to get 
<br>[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=862)   see in times hear in times feel in times feel out. 
<br>[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=867)   That's why if you've ever noticed, it's like, I can handle it, I can handle it, I can handle 
<br>[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=872)   it. 
<br>[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=873)   And you're like, oh, I can't handle it, okay. 
<br>[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=876)   It's not linear, right? 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=878)   It's not like it grows like this, it grows like this. 
<br>[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=883)   That's because things are starting to cross multiply. 
<br>[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=889)   But if you have enough clarity to separate out the strands so that they don't, they don't 
<br>[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=899)   tangle and reinforce each other, then actually it just grows linearly. 
<br>[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=905)   And yes, it gets more and more and more, but you don't get this sort of like snowballing 
<br>[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=913)   overwhelm thing. 
<br>[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=915)   It just grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, and then 
<br>[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=921)   something happens. 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=922)   And then grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows, grows. 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=927)   And then it just flows, flows, flows, flows. 
<br>[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=931)   And then, yeah, you go through another cycle and it's a little more. 
<br>[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=936)   And then it flows, flows, flows, flows. 
<br>[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=939)   The whole mind-body process. 
<br>[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=945)   It's scary because the ordinary ordering principle is completely unavailable. 
<br>[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=953)   The ordinary ordering principle for the body is get comfortable. 
<br>[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=957)   The ordinary ordering principle for the mind is get answers. 
<br>[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=962)   And you can't do either. 
<br>[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=965)   Those are just not available. 
<br>[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=966)   The mind can't process. 
<br>[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=968)   In fact, your eyes are sort of rolling in your head and you're right on the verge of 
<br>[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=975)   passing out. 
<br>[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=979)   But you've got a smile on your face because you're moment by moment tasting purification. 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=991)   And so you're getting an immediate reward. 
<br>[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=998)   Once again, this may sound radical, but half the people in this room have done this. 
<br>[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1005)   I remember back if you had kids. 
<br>[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1011)   So it's just a matter of doing it in a really systematic way. 
<br>[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1023)   So that's a really big object, the whole mind-body self. 
<br>[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1031)   But if we appreciate it to the extreme, just as it is, then at some point it becomes flowing 
<br>[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1042)   space. 
<br>[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1043)   Gradually, gradually, gradually you work your way up to this. 
<br>[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1048)   It's not, it's a homework assignment. 
<br>[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1050)   You've got the rest of your life to turn in. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1057)   And you don't have to do it if you don't want to. 
<br>[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1059)   You can just follow the path of bliss, the jhanas, the absorptions, what have you. 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYSSf71Vo7w&t=1064)   That works too.
