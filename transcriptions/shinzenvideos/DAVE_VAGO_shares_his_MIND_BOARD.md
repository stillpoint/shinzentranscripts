title: "DAVE VAGO shares his (MIND) BOARD"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=0)   This is a board. 
<br>[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=19)   Ha ha, yes. 
<br>[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=21)   With brains. 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=23)   Definitely a board. 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=24)   And writing. 
<br>[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=26)   And here is Dave Vago. 
<br>[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=30)   This is his board. 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=31)   Now, who are you? 
<br>[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=33)   No one really. 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=34)   No one. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=35)   Ha ha, yes. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=37)   I mean, what's interesting probably about this board is it just represents some person's 
<br>[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=45)   thoughts from the past year or two that, you know, sort of gives you a sort of an external 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=53)   scratch pad in which to sort of put all your thoughts into one place. 
<br>[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=58)   Sometimes it's nice. 
<br>[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=59)   It's easier to put it there than to keep it in here, right? 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=63)   So what you're seeing is, yes, exactly that. 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=67)   It's the things that have happened in my sort of head for a long time. 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=72)   But we really just start here with this quote up here. 
<br>[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=75)   This happiness is unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a course greater 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=81)   than oneself. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=83)   That sort of, I think, you know, being on the top sort of fuels the inspiration. 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=87)   And then, so let's see. 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=90)   We can start anywhere, really. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=92)   What is mindfulness? 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=93)   I mean, this is something that I'm always asking myself. 
<br>[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=96)   I've got a few different versions of what other people have said it is, either self-regulation 
<br>[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=101)   and present-centered awareness. 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=103)   Other people have said, oh, well, it's actually intention, attention, and awareness. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=107)   And so using that, I've tried to build upon that and come up with my own ideas, which 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=113)   are in different areas that didn't fit on the board, have been put in different parts 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=118)   of this room. 
<br>[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=119)   But they sort of relate to this. 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=122)   If we go to what's happening in the mind when, you know, one is meditating, for example, 
<br>[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=128)   these are just two modalities that sort of arise in people's minds. 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=134)   And it's really talking about what happens if you start to understand how objects of 
<br>[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=139)   one's attention, either visual or auditory, arise. 
<br>[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=143)   We're going in it instead of a usual attempt. 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=146)   Time usually goes in that sort of linear horizontal plane. 
<br>[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=151)   But here we're doing a vertical plane. 
<br>[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=153)   So time is really going down in this direction. 
<br>[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=158)   So something arises, a visual object, a mental sort of image arises. 
<br>[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=162)   And then it passes. 
<br>[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=164)   And so you're able to, once you're able to refine your meditation techniques, you can 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=168)   start to really notice the change between arising and passing. 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=172)   And then eventually you get to a point where you can, you see things gone or vanish. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=179)   And this can all be actually related to flow. 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=182)   Flow sort of can be experienced throughout the entire. 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=185)   What's flow? 
<br>[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=186)   Flow is sort of just the dynamic changes of seeing things moving and rippling in time 
<br>[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=192)   throughout the entire process. 
<br>[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=194)   So it's not static. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=195)   It's not ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=196)   There's a constant change going on. 
<br>[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=199)   And actually, so really this is a dynamic board too. 
<br>[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=205)   It's just changed. 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=206)   It's just changed. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=207)   It's really rest work right there. 
<br>[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=209)   And this flow is, relates to this whole sort of process can be in flow. 
<br>[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=216)   But you can actually, once something vanishes, then you can actually rest and observe what's 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=221)   happening at rest. 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=223)   And then if something all disappears, then you can have cessation, which is sort of the 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=227)   road dots, the real true gone, the big G gone. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=231)   Big G, is that what you call it? 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=233)   Big G, that's what Shinzen calls it. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=234)   Oh, okay. 
<br>[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=235)   Big G versus little G, which is just the absence of that thing being there anymore, but the 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=239)   big G is something that's like complete absence of self and all the strands that make up everything 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=245)   in consciousness. 
<br>[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=246)   But the other thing really that's worth saying about this is, well, that all sort of relates 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=254)   to what we're going to sort of define as to what is mindfulness. 
<br>[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=257)   And then I guess we can sort of move this way, I guess. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=263)   This part of the brain is probably one of the most critical pieces, we think, for what's 
<br>[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=267)   happening here, because what you don't see here, you see in here, but there's also a 
<br>[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=272)   sort of somatic or viscerosomatic aspect of what's happening. 
<br>[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=277)   And that viscerosomatic sensation of what's happening inside, putting like a feeling in 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=282)   the body for all motion, comes from this structure here. 
<br>[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=286)   This is called the insula. 
<br>[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=287)   It's located sort of deep within the folds of your brain. 
<br>[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=291)   So if you were to sort of open up, there's a little prop here. 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=295)   See, there's a brain. 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=298)   Oh, a brain. 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=299)   So if you open up the fold here, actually it's probably better for you this way. 
<br>[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=304)   Open up the fold here, this is the lateral fissure, and just open it up, you'll see this. 
<br>[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=308)   And so that's the insula. 
<br>[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=310)   What's so cool about it is that it represents sort of the whole internal sort of feeling 
<br>[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=316)   states from very primary sort of sensory sort of information. 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=322)   It represents things like homeostatic motor function going on in the more posterior aspects. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=328)   And then as you move more interior, you get these environmental sort of things going on 
<br>[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=333)   in the body. 
<br>[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=334)   And then you start moving to the more human-like things that are very unique to humans in the 
<br>[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=339)   anterior portion. 
<br>[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=340)   And this portion here is actually 35% larger in humans than it is in macaque monkeys. 
<br>[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=347)   So there must be something special about it. 
<br>[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=349)   Macaque monkeys actually only have this posterior and mid portion of it, and it's actually that 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=354)   whole posterior and mid portion is just extended throughout the entire length of the insula 
<br>[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=360)   of macaque monkeys. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=361)   There's also something really interesting about this anterior portion. 
<br>[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=364)   It's more important for hedonic conditions like our motivational, social, cognitive feelings 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=370)   of other and yourself and how you relate to the world, the sort of more emotional types 
<br>[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=376)   of states. 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=377)   That part's here. 
<br>[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=379)   There's also these special neurons here called von Economo neurons. 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=382)   They're very special types of neurons. 
<br>[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=385)   It's possible that autistic children or adults even may not even have that type of neuron 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=391)   there, and that may be part of the reason that they don't have those type of connections 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=396)   with others and oneself. 
<br>[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=398)   So this is a very special part of the brain anterior insula, which may be very important 
<br>[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=404)   for meditation and developing an understanding of oneself. 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=407)   And so you may need this, and it actually grows in size after only eight weeks of meditation. 
<br>[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=415)   How much? 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=416)   How much can it grow? 
<br>[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=417)   I don't know. 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=418)   I mean, you do have a skull. 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=419)   Permanently grows? 
<br>[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=420)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=421)   Will it grow and then go back down if you stop meditating? 
<br>[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=423)   We don't know. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=424)   That's a good question. 
<br>[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=425)   So let's see. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=426)   What else we got here? 
<br>[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=427)   We got, we can focus right here, which is the stages of insight. 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=433)   So as you meditate, you can go through different various stages, and these are sort of described 
<br>[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=437)   by different various people. 
<br>[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=439)   This is described in the Sutta Magga, the path to liberation. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=445)   So a traditional Buddhist text. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=448)   Other people have described it who are just more modern sort of Buddhist geeks, I guess 
<br>[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=452)   you can call them, like Daniel Ingram or someone like that. 
<br>[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=457)   And they sort of describe these stages as thought as a thought, cause and effect, impermanence, 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=463)   suffering, no self, realizing, those types of things. 
<br>[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=465)   That's one stage. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=467)   And then arising and passing away would be another sort of stage of realization or just 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=473)   understanding, anicca, or impermanence. 
<br>[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=475)   And it sort of relates back to what this was, because remember I told you that you see arising 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=479)   and passing of an object, space, but this is just sort of a one-time thing. 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=484)   You may see the arising and passing of an object over and over and over again, until 
<br>[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=488)   you realize, oh my God, everything is arising and passing, including myself. 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=491)   And that's sort of what this stage is really referring to. 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=495)   Then eventually you move to dissolution, where everything sort of just dissolves. 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=498)   And that can be kind of scary. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=500)   So you go through these stages, which some people refer to as the dark night, which is 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=504)   terror, misery, and disgust. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=506)   And then once you get past that, which some people get through really quickly, some people 
<br>[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=509)   take a long time, in any case then you can move into some aspect of re-observation, where 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=515)   you re-observe what's going on inside your head and you gain equanimity, which is a powerful 
<br>[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=521)   sort of way of experiencing the world, sort of like a sturdy mast in a storm does on a 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=528)   sailboat. 
<br>[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=530)   And then you enter stream entry. 
<br>[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=532)   And this may be a little bit overrated, but I'm not sure if this is a goal for everybody. 
<br>[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=538)   But it's a state that people describe as sort of a selfless state, where it's a complete 
<br>[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=547)   paradigm shift. 
<br>[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=549)   And once you're there, it's not likely that you're going to come out of the stream. 
<br>[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=555)   But it's one of the stages of developing insight. 
<br>[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=561)   However, there's going to be arguments about this. 
<br>[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=564)   Let's see. 
<br>[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=565)   So where are we at right now? 
<br>[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=566)   So we can go up here. 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=567)   There's a few brain areas. 
<br>[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=568)   Oh, good. 
<br>[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=569)   Brain areas. 
<br>[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=570)   Let's see. 
<br>[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=571)   We can talk about the amygdala, which is really one of the areas that we're really interested 
<br>[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=575)   in, and how it connects to all these different areas in the frontal lobe. 
<br>[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=578)   These are the medial frontal areas. 
<br>[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=582)   And there's numbers there. 
<br>[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=583)   Like, the numbers all correspond to different sort of sub-systems, really sub-areas of the 
<br>[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=588)   brain that have been distinguished by the orientation of really just cells, but have 
<br>[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=594)   also functional differences, like Area 25, BA25 is what they call the subgenual cingulate. 
<br>[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=602)   It's interesting because you can stimulate this area in people who have intractable forms 
<br>[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=607)   of depression, people who just can't be cured by drugs, psychotherapy, ECT, you name it. 
<br>[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=615)   They just can't be cured. 
<br>[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=617)   They have depression, and they're just in the blues. 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=620)   They have a lot of problems. 
<br>[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=625)   What they found is actually if you stimulate this area with deep brain stimulation, so 
<br>[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=632)   electrodes deep into the brain go, suddenly they wake up, and they're happy. 
<br>[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=638)   So it's really interesting to think that there can be those sort of substrates in the brain 
<br>[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=642)   where you can stimulate, and suddenly people are happy who weren't. 
<br>[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=645)   So that's one of the reasons why we do this work, is so we can understand what areas of 
<br>[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=649)   the brain are involved with different types of psychopathology and emotion, and then we 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=654)   can sort of better use these ideas as sort of diagnostic tools, and then for better targeted 
<br>[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=660)   therapy. 
<br>[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=662)   Then you have DLPFC, which is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is important for 
<br>[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=668)   working memory and sort of goal-directed thinking and sort of concentrations. 
<br>[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=673)   Then this whole area can be considered sort of the orbital frontal cortex, that's OFC. 
<br>[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=679)   And then the ACC, which is the anterior cingulate cortex, which is also one of the most important 
<br>[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=685)   areas of the brain, because you see that area light up for practically everything. 
<br>[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=690)   But the dorsal cingulate is probably one of the parts that are really important for meditation. 
<br>[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=696)   We've seen that it grows also in size, like the insula, but has a different functional 
<br>[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=700)   mechanism. 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=701)   It's more monitoring, so like awareness, meta-awareness. 
<br>[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=704)   Dorsal and anterior cingulate seems to be really important for that. 
<br>[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=709)   So we can stay somewhere, let's see, we can move over to here, and we see mindfulness 
<br>[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=718)   versus CBD. 
<br>[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=719)   So this is sort of just a study that we were thinking of looking at, well, cognitive behavioral 
<br>[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=723)   therapies happens to be one of the most effective sort of treatments for depression and anxiety 
<br>[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=729)   and different other forms of psychopathology. 
<br>[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=731)   Well how does it hold up in a horse race against mindfulness? 
<br>[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=734)   If we even know what mindfulness is, we can think of it as an eight week program of learning 
<br>[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=739)   how to meditate and doing some Hatha yoga. 
<br>[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=744)   So the question I guess here is can it hold up and reduce some of the aspects of psychopathology, 
<br>[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=756)   the symptoms that are related to psychopathology that CBT was intended to target. 
<br>[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=761)   And so CBT was developed by a guy named Aaron Beck, and he created this triad of things 
<br>[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=767)   that are going on in people's world view on his rumination and sort of negative aspects 
<br>[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=773)   of processing things over and over again in one's head. 
<br>[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=778)   So a very sort of negative self-focus, so thinking about oneself in a negative framework 
<br>[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=784)   was his first sort of aspect of his triad. 
<br>[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=788)   And the other one was a negative world view towards the present and the future. 
<br>[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=794)   Actually all of this together creates his triad. 
<br>[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=797)   So if you're thinking about yourself as negative, the world is negative, in the past everything sucked, 
<br>[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=804)   and in the future everything is going to suck, that's basically what's happening when you have 
<br>[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=809)   depression in sort of the Beck sort of model. 
<br>[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=816)   You may agree or disagree with some of the things I say, but this is just a slice of my thinking on the board. 
<br>[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=822)   That's all you're really getting here. 
<br>[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=824)   And so some of the things that you see in these types of people across most psychopathologies, 
<br>[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=829)   emotional reactivity, people who react to emotional stressor in a way that's maladaptive, 
<br>[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=835)   that's perseverative, that stays on all day, you can't let it go. 
<br>[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=840)   You can avoid things, that's also a bad emotion regulation strategy, 
<br>[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=844)   you just either perceptually avoid things, you don't even look at the things that sort of bother you, 
<br>[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=848)   or you just choose not to deal with it when you see it. 
<br>[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=852)   Suppress emotion, it's a plunted response, also not good for you. 
<br>[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=858)   So CBT, one year relapse rate is about 25%. 
<br>[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=864)   So that's interesting, so people who get therapy that sort of focuses on these aspects of the world, 
<br>[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=871)   in one year they will actually, only 25% of people will actually relapse back into depression 
<br>[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=875)   or some form of psychopathology. 
<br>[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=878)   Antidepressant use is 50%, so clearly drugs are not as effective, at least in that sort of context, as CBT. 
<br>[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=890)   It turns out that mindfulness, with some CBT, is also as effective in preventing relapse 
<br>[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=898)   for people who have experienced at least three episodes of depression. 
<br>[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=902)   So that sort of fits into that equation as well. 
<br>[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=904)   So we're interested in things like bias, rumination, emotional reactivity and avoidance, 
<br>[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=909)   and how do we target these things and measure them. 
<br>[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=912)   So that turns into stickies, and adds more to the story here. 
<br>[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=917)   The question I guess here is augmentation, can we augment traditional forms of approaches 
<br>[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=922)   like CBT and antidepressants with mindfulness as an augmentation strategy. 
<br>[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=927)   So we're not just saying no drugs, but we're saying, okay, we'll give you some drugs, 
<br>[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=932)   but we want to augment that strategy with something like mindfulness, and that may be more helpful. 
<br>[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=938)   Then you see some more little, I think we're moving along here, if we get them, yellow stickies here. 
<br>[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=945)   Some of the concepts that I've been thinking about, I guess, for mindfulness, mind, clearly, 
<br>[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=952)   is one of them, dullness, level of dullness is something we need to understand. 
<br>[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=957)   Effort, that moves from positive to little, to negative meaning no effort. 
<br>[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=963)   Mental defilements, things that cloud your mind and that produce problems, 
<br>[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=971)   and negative thoughts. Distraction is also part of, these are actually parts of the, 
<br>[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=977)   that came out of the Tanka painting of the Path to Stages of Insight. 
<br>[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=981)   I sort of just took the pieces out and put them on the yellow stickies. 
<br>[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=985)   So they're all parts of the Path to Insight that sort of arise and you have to deal with them. 
<br>[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=991)   And mental awareness, mindfulness just says, what's the outcome, truly, 
<br>[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=996)   of a dull mind, a stabilized mind, and insight into one's mind. 
<br>[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1001)   And this little loop is sort of my way of describing that you are S, 
<br>[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1006)   and as you go through this path, you sort of loop around in this spiral, 
<br>[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1010)   and you come out with S prime, something a little different. 
<br>[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1013)   And in the back here you see a Chinese, or a Kanji character, 
<br>[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1017)   sort of what maybe mindfulness can be described as a Kanji character for presence, 
<br>[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1025)   or a Kanji character for heart. Together they create mindfulness, presence of heart. 
<br>[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1029)   That may be a good way to think about it. 
<br>[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1031)   Oh, and then you have a little Chitta Bhavana, a development of mind, 
<br>[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1035)   spiritual cultivation, something else, some more sort of little, I guess, 
<br>[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1038)   aspect of what we think about. What else? 
<br>[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1044)   So, now we can talk about craving. We talk about craving, for example, for cigarettes, 
<br>[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1051)   or even craving from the Buddhist point of view, is sort of an abstract concept. 
<br>[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1057)   It's not so simple as just one area of the brain. 
<br>[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1061)   And so if you look at all the literature out there, where craving is located in the brain, 
<br>[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1064)   whether it's for cigarettes in terms of addiction, or craving in terms of even a loved one that you lose, 
<br>[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1071)   so for a loss, there's different parts of the brain that are involved. 
<br>[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1075)   So many parts of the brain that it's going to be really hard to try to localize. 
<br>[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1080)   If you look here, this is the right hemisphere. 
<br>[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1084)   These are all the areas of the brain with little hash marks that, from all the research that we looked at, 
<br>[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1089)   have aspects of involvement in craving. 
<br>[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1094)   So, this is just the right side, and the left side is down here. 
<br>[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1099)   So there's a lot of things going on in terms of the brain, brain activity for craving. 
<br>[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1104)   So it's not so simple. 
<br>[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1107)   Here you can see some of the things we've listed here. 
<br>[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1112)   Oh, this actually, I guess I haven't looked at this in a while, because this, 
<br>[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1116)   craving, rumination, self-regulation, emotion regulation, attention, 
<br>[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1122)   these are actually some aspects of how we think the arrows, I guess, are working, 
<br>[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1128)   that mindfulness may be working. 
<br>[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1131)   Reducing craving, reducing rumination, reducing avoidance and reactivity, increasing efficiency of attention, 
<br>[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1138)   improving pro-social and ethical development, and maybe working at unconscious levels, 
<br>[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1144)   heavy in learning, so sort of associative conditioning, facilitating extinction and reconsolidation, 
<br>[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1152)   decreasing resource allocation, so improving the efficiency of your whole brain. 
<br>[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1158)   Let's see, what else? Okay, there's two more things on this board. 
<br>[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1161)   If you can imagine, I think we've talked enough, but... 
<br>[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1164)   That's great. 
<br>[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1165)   Two more things. We've got schizophrenia. 
<br>[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1167)   Oh, good. Let's go to schizophrenia. 
<br>[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1170)   Okay, schizophrenia is right up here. 
<br>[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1173)   So it turns out that we have multiple paradigms that we test schizophrenics on, 
<br>[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1181)   and one of them is an emotional memory test. 
<br>[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1184)   We give schizophrenics a bunch of words that could be thought-provoking or disturbing to a schizophrenic, 
<br>[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1192)   and they show increases in all these brain areas, in the perinepocampal areas, in the amygdala, 
<br>[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1199)   in the insula, aminoprefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
<br>[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1204)   And so what does it all mean? 
<br>[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1207)   Well, you create a story out of it. I'm not going to go into the whole story, 
<br>[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1210)   but essentially you have all these areas that sort of come online related to emotional memory, 
<br>[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1218)   which makes sense, and we always compare these brain areas' activation to a normal subject. 
<br>[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1226)   So increases in the insular activity may be some sort of emotional reactivity 
<br>[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1233)   and an evaluative type of thing going on as well. 
<br>[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1240)   Decreased PCC, which may represent some sort of decreased representation of self 
<br>[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1245)   or autobiographical nature of oneself. 
<br>[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1247)   So we don't know exactly how it all pieces together. 
<br>[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1249)   You sort of have to read the paper to get the sense of really how it all fits together, 
<br>[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1253)   or else you just see a bunch of arrows. 
<br>[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1255)   But then there's another paradigm called... 
<br>[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1257)   Read the paper? What paper? 
<br>[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1258)   The paper will probably come out eventually on schizophrenia. 
<br>[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1265)   We did a CBT intervention with them, actually, and so it turns out schizophrenics can respond to CBT. 
<br>[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1271)   Remember CBT? 
<br>[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1272)   Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. 
<br>[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1275)   AT, that means anticipatory threat. 
<br>[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1277)   We looked at how schizophrenics sort of anticipate threat. 
<br>[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1283)   So it turns out that they have these really interesting increases in activity and visual association areas. 
<br>[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1289)   What does that mean? 
<br>[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1290)   It could be that they're really processing threat at a very sort of primary level of sensory processing. 
<br>[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1302)   Much more activity going on there than a normal individual would, 
<br>[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1306)   and that could also facilitate how one processes threat. 
<br>[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1310)   If there's increased sensory processing, then that could also lead to increased interpretation of threat. 
<br>[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1318)   And amygdala and hippocampus go up, too. 
<br>[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1320)   That means that there's also increases in sort of autonomic reactivity to the threat. 
<br>[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1328)   And when they're in safety, when they know that they can be safe and that there's no threat, 
<br>[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1333)   there's still increased processing and the visceral sort of activities going on 
<br>[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1338)   and some of the precuneus activity as well. 
<br>[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1340)   So what does that mean? 
<br>[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1341)   I mean, we're not sure for sure, but there's definitely some extra processing going on that's probably unnecessary 
<br>[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1348)   in trying to interpret what's happening. 
<br>[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1351)   Okay, so there's one last thing here that we can really sort of focus on, I guess, for this board. 
<br>[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1357)   And I think it's probably this little board thing here. 
<br>[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1361)   This is the default mode network. 
<br>[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1364)   We hate the default mode network because it's confusing. 
<br>[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1368)   Who hates it? 
<br>[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1370)   I hate it because it represents what happens to your mind when it's wandering. 
<br>[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1375)   And they call it stimulus-independent thought. 
<br>[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1380)   So what you do when you're thinking, when you're not really doing anything else. 
<br>[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1385)   It's not goal-directed. It's very passive. 
<br>[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1388)   But when it's passive, it's actually doing a lot of things. 
<br>[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1391)   It's self-reflecting about the past and the future. 
<br>[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1394)   And Randy Buckner's group has sort of parsed apart the, or sort of used very highly advanced statistical modeling techniques 
<br>[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1405)   to say that there's actually two subsystems within the default mode network. 
<br>[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1409)   One could be the DMPFC network, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex network. 
<br>[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1416)   That involves the TPJ, temporal parietal junction, also a very interesting area. 
<br>[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1421)   Even if you're bored already, this is an area that if you're stimulated, you would have an out-of-body experience. 
<br>[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1426)   It's a very dissociative area. So TPJ is actually quite interesting. 
<br>[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1429)   And the lateral temporal cortex and the temporal pole. 
<br>[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1432)   That's one network. 
<br>[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1434)   And the other one would be the medial temporal lobe network, which involves ventral medial prefrontal cortex. 
<br>[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1440)   And what's so cool about that area, it's evaluative in nature. 
<br>[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1444)   In the sense that whenever you evaluate anything, the ventral medial prefrontal cortex comes online. 
<br>[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1451)   But it also involves posterior inferior parietal lobe, hippocampal formation. 
<br>[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1457)   So areas that are more related to memory, that autobiographical memory. 
<br>[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1463)   And it turns out that that subsystem is more important for maybe thinking about oneself in the future. 
<br>[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1469)   Whereas this network is more important for thinking about oneself in the present. 
<br>[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1474)   Whether it's oneself or other. 
<br>[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1476)   Can you see these different networks when you look at the brain? 
<br>[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1479)   Yeah, exactly. 
<br>[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1481)   Activate separately. 
<br>[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1483)   So that's what we're hoping to disambiguate them from what people are doing when they're doing nothing. 
<br>[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1487)   It's not a default mode. 
<br>[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1489)   Everyone has different things that they think about when they're not thinking about anything. 
<br>[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1493)   And meditators happen to have a problem thinking about or wandering really far. 
<br>[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1498)   So that they're going to look very different from a lot of people. 
<br>[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1502)   Especially the people who ruminate. 
<br>[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1504)   They look very different. 
<br>[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1507)   There's also this area here, which actually is two nodes of the default mode network that are shared between these two subsystems. 
<br>[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1515)   That's the anterior medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. 
<br>[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1520)   They just happen to be the connections for the whole default mode network. 
<br>[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1524)   Okay, well thank you for coming. 
<br>[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1526)   Thank you very much. That was great. 
<br>[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKxK9YTaTgA&t=1528)   Insert applause here. 
<br>
