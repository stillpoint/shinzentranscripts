title: "How Shinzen Dealt with Travel Dramas  ~ Shinzen Young"

<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=0)   So, apropos of sharing my stories and my practice, so you sort of got the impression that I was 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=23)   fairly majorly bummed out by my travel fiasco. So, how did I deal with it, practice wise? 
<br>[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=40)   Well, one thing is the obvious, when things would come up, I did use the focus him technique. 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=48)   I tend to use that when I'm upset for the obvious reasons. Inevitably, the self returns, 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=57)   right? So, there's two freedoms from the self. Well, there's a lot of freedoms from the self. 
<br>[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=65)   Many faceted, many, many ways actually. But the two that I like to mostly think about 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=72)   is, well, there's the experience of, quote, all rest, the non-arising of seeing, hearing, 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=81)   feeling. That actually happens much more frequently than people realize. One of the reasons that 
<br>[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=87)   I give you these categories is so that you can start to notice that in fact you already 
<br>[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=95)   are enlightened, at least microscopically. Because if you really pay close attention 
<br>[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=102)   to the inner activation system, you'll see that there are all rest moments. And that's 
<br>[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=108)   a relative no-self experience. It may not be clear and intense enough to cause a stream 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=115)   entry or permanent change, but that is a relative moment of no-self. Now, if you happen to catch 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=125)   an intense arising of all three at the very beginning, and you completely quantumize it, 
<br>[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=134)   and you catch the moment when all three vanish, and subjective space itself collapses to God, 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=141)   then actually you will have a stream entry experience. That's why Sasaki Roshi seems 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=147)   like he's very mean, because he describes how the self arises and passes, and then he 
<br>[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=155)   makes damn sure that that's going to happen for you by saying things about you in public. 
<br>[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=166)   Oh yeah. There's no censoring and there's no mercy in that regard. Because he's just 
<br>[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=183)   playing a numbers game, hoping that he's got enough students here in America and makes 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=191)   people intensely self-conscious in front of all their friends enough times. Someone's 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=198)   going to have what it takes to actually keep the practice going while that's happening, 
<br>[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=206)   rather than get into the he said, she said, F you. One form of freedom is, well, it doesn't 
<br>[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=223)   arise, and you actually notice that. This also is part of the koan system that uses. 
<br>[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=233)   So first it's like, okay, when you see the flower, how do you become free from yourself? 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=239)   He wants sea out without any sea in here. And he wants the sea out, it's even itself 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=247)   to be flown. But then the next question is going to be, or not the next, but another 
<br>[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=254)   one somewhere down the line is, okay, good. It's wonderful. You achieve oneness with flower. 
<br>[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=263)   Now how do you separate from flower? Some of you are smiling because you actually have 
<br>[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=270)   this koan. How do you separate from flower? What does that mean? Does it mean make an 
<br>[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=279)   object out of the flower? Well, not in the normal sense because the goal is to not need 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=285)   to do that. But what it means is that the judging self does arise. However, it arises 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=297)   as an unfixated flow. It is completely equanimized. So that even though it is a self as an arising, 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=311)   it is not a self as a thing. And so you've returned to yourself, but it's not really 
<br>[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=320)   the self. So my languaging for this is, so, well, I'll tell you another story. I was privileged 
<br>[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=335)   many years ago to live in the same Vihara, the same Theravada Buddhist monastery as Ananda 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=342)   Maitreya. Ananda Maitreya was sort of the Sasaki Roshi of Theravada Buddhism in some 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=348)   ways. He was the grand old man, he was in his 90s, from Sri Lanka. And I remember seeing 
<br>[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=359)   him as a much younger person in a BBC documentary called The Longest Journey. It's a documentary 
<br>[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=366)   where they went around the world and interviewed spiritual leaders. And they interviewed him. 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=374)   And they said, well, could you summarize in a few sentences Buddhism? And he said, well, 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=382)   I can actually summarize it in a few words. No self, no problem. You might have heard 
<br>[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=387)   of that. As far as I know, he's the person that originated that. However, I have my little 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=396)   codicil, my version of that. So, no self, no problem. The non-arising of the self. No 
<br>[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=406)   self, no problem. But also, no self, no problem. Flow self, no problem. You follow? The self 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=421)   realizes, perhaps with the mentions, perhaps firing on all three syllables. See, and hear, 
<br>[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=428)   and see. But it's a flow self. It is a self. And flow and fill the room with its doing. 
<br>[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=440)   It's a room-sized personality, which is the diametric opposite of a room-sized ego. So, 
<br>[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=454)   yeah, I sort of used focus in. Yeah, a little bit to sort of process. But I also did something 
<br>[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=463)   else, which was more in the line of nurture positive cognition. Entertaining a certain 
<br>[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=476)   thought pattern. I think in psychology this is sometimes referred to as an explanatory 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=487)   mechanism. It's like, okay, doo-doo happened. Now, how do you think about it? You think 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=495)   about this like, okay, this doo-doo always happens to me, or the world is, you know, 
<br>[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=503)   a pit of doo-doo. Or, why am I attracting this doo-doo to myself? Or, well, doo-doo 
<br>[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=513)   happens and I accept it. Okay, am I right? In psychology, I think someone's saying yes, 
<br>[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=522)   that there's a term explanatory style or explanatory mechanism. It's like, how do you use talk 
<br>[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=528)   space to deal with stuff? So, what I use is Pratītyasamutpāda. But it's actually, it's 
<br>[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=543)   only very minorly in talk space, actually. Not surprisingly, it's in image space. And 
<br>[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=551)   I've noticed over the years that this sort of image-based cognitive reframing is coming 
<br>[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=562)   easier and easier and easier, more and more naturally. And I think it has something to 
<br>[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=567)   do with the whole sensitizing within the visual field that I described to you that is such 
<br>[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=573)   a major element in my practice. So, what I think is, I'm putting it into words, but as 
<br>[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=582)   I say, I'm more see it than think it in words. It's like, okay, well, yeah, it's in words 
<br>[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=589)   too, though, it's true, now that I'm saying it. It's like, okay, I've been doing this 
<br>[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=596)   stuff for 40 years, and I always made retreats on time, because I'd leave the day early. 
<br>[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=604)   And if there was a problem, you know, then they'd get me there at least by the next day. 
<br>[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=611)   And then I'm thinking, okay, well, there's really been a deterioration in the whole travel 
<br>[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=620)   experience. There's the tension in the airport around the security, and are you going to 
<br>[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=629)   make your flight, and then a lot of the flights get cancelled, and so, what's behind this? 
<br>[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=642)   Why has there been this deterioration? Well, there's probably many factors, and I'm not 
<br>[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=648)   exactly an economist or very savvy in the political field, but what comes up to my mind 
<br>[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=654)   is, well, this is at least partially a consequence of 9-11. And then I ask myself, what was behind 
<br>[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=667)   9-11? Well, lots of stuff. Part of it is US policies in the Middle East. And what's behind 
<br>[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=681)   that? Now, you all know I love Israel, okay, I go there whenever, but, I don't talk about 
<br>[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=695)   this stuff, okay, because it's not my area of expertise. I know what it means to know 
<br>[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=701)   a subject really well. And one of the great things about knowing a subject really well, 
<br>[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=710)   and by the way, the subject is sensory reality, okay, one of the great things, most people 
<br>[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=717)   don't have something that they know really well, right, as well as anyone in the world, 
<br>[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=724)   but I'll tell you one of the great things about that is it leads to a huge sense of 
<br>[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=728)   humility, because you know what it means to know something really well. And when I think 
<br>[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=736)   about all the other things that I would like to pontificate on, like relative to knowing 
<br>[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=742)   something really well, like what do I know about politics and economics and national 
<br>[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=747)   policies and how stuff should be run by governments, you know, I know, I can imagine what it would 
<br>[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=757)   be like to really know that well, but like forget about it, I mean, not even remotely, 
<br>[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=762)   so that could lead to a certain refreshing humility to realize that sort of militates 
<br>[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=771)   against the tendency to just want to pontificate on every topic that comes up, like I see people 
<br>[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=780)   in my health club doing, arguing about politics, oh my god, after the election, it was bloody. 
<br>[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=792)   Because if you were rooting for the other guy, you were hurting, and there aren't many 
<br>[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=796)   people in Vermont that were rooting for the other guy. So I really felt sorry for the 
<br>[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=807)   ones that were, I mean really. So anyway, so let's not go there as far as, but the fact 
<br>[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=817)   is that, and what's behind that? Well, the Holocaust, and what's behind that? Well, the 
<br>[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=828)   way Germany was treated after World War I, which was very abusive, I mean if you look 
<br>[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=835)   at the history of, oh my god, senior moment. What was the, right after World War I, Versailles, 
<br>[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=856)   yeah, if you look at what happened at Versailles, if you look at the memoirs of some of those 
<br>[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=860)   people, they knew that they had sown the seeds for another war. They just knew it, but they 
<br>[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=867)   couldn't help doing it. They just couldn't stop it, because they just wanted to beat 
<br>[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=877)   up Germany, get even. So, and what's behind that? Well, all the shit in the 19th century, 
<br>[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=888)   okay, in Europe, okay. You know, what the French did when they invaded Germany, okay, 
<br>[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=899)   wasn't pretty, etc., etc., etc. And you get this sense that there's no one to blame and 
<br>[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=907)   everyone's to blame. It just, it just put the behind, behind, the behind, and that means 
<br>[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=919)   that the world sucks. That's not how I perceive it. Remember I said that N means this causality, 
<br>[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=934)   but it also means connection. So the inconvenience that I go through when I have to travel now, 
<br>[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=946)   that's my direct, direct touching of all of the above. And it's part of the vastness of 
<br>[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kkjMD8T8VM&t=964)   my true being. And that's that. 
<br>
