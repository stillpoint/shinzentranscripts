title: "How Shinzen Became Involved in Native American Spirituality"

---
<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=0)   You do Native American ceremonies. I'd be interested in how you got into that and also 
<br>[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=16)   how that fits into the Buddhist, the ritual ceremony, how these two practices are compatible 
<br>[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=25)   for you. Sure. The way it started was, gee, I'm thinking maybe at least 25, maybe 30 years 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=38)   ago, I was running retreats in the Tucson area at a ranch that was owned by a man named 
<br>[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=46)   Doug Boyd. Doug Boyd's father is very famous. His name is Elmer Green, and he's one of the 
<br>[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=53)   pioneers in brainwave biofeedback, actually. Doug had this ranch that he let us use to 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=63)   run our mindfulness retreats. The first time we did a retreat out there, he came to me 
<br>[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=72)   at the beginning of the retreat and he said, I grew up in Asia, and I've always wanted 
<br>[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=81)   to bring good representatives of Asian spirituality together with good representatives of the 
<br>[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=90)   Native spirituality of this area, the American Indians from this area, the Arizona area. 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=100)   He tells me he's got a friend named Rupert Encinas, who he describes as a pipe holder, 
<br>[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=109)   a sweat lodge leader, and a sun dancer. I had no idea what any of those things implied, 
<br>[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=118)   but the way he said it, it sounded like it was important and a big deal. Then he says, 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=125)   and if you want, at the end of the retreat, he will run a sweat lodge ceremony for your 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=132)   group. I asked him to describe the sweat lodge ceremony, and he did, and it sounded like, 
<br>[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=140)   oh, that could be interesting. That's what happened. When the retreat was over, we told 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=146)   people, anybody that's interested, you can stay on. One of the local Native American 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=152)   spiritual leaders named Rupert Encinas is going to take us through a traditional ceremony 
<br>[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=161)   called the sweat lodge. A bunch of people did elect to stay, so we did this. I remember 
<br>[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=172)   vividly what that experience was. It impacted at all levels. I was just amazed. I was amazed 
<br>[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=181)   at how subtle and multi-leveled this thing was. On the surface, it was sort of like just 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=191)   a physical thing. Hey, we're in a sauna here. We're kind of like sweating for maybe even 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=195)   health purposes. It sort of had a surface level of maybe a physical cleansing paradigm. 
<br>[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=203)   Then at a deeper level, it's a religious ceremony. You're praying and so forth. It's also a group 
<br>[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=212)   psychotherapy where people are burying their souls. Men are crying. The boundaries and 
<br>[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=221)   the inhibitions break down. You're sort of all together in this small hot area. It's 
<br>[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=227)   dark. Women are wearing just cotton dresses. Men are in bathing trunks. Very intimate, 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=234)   very close. There are these intense physical sensations from the heat and whatever. It's 
<br>[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=239)   opening people up. It's a group psychotherapy. Whatever anybody says, everybody supports 
<br>[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=245)   them. They say, that's good. Wazhtelo, that's good. Hechiduktelo, it's like, yeah, so be 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=258)   it. It's like this huge supportive environment where people are just letting all this psychological 
<br>[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=264)   material out. It's like a group process, a group therapy, group psychotherapy. At another 
<br>[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=271)   level, it's a shamanic journey because the intensity of the heat and whatever, you're 
<br>[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=276)   starting to go into the power realms and see spirits and the rocks and so forth. At another 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=282)   level, it matches the Buddhist paradigm of purification equals intensity multiplied by 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=290)   equanimity. You're in this ceremonial context. Within that context, everything has become 
<br>[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=299)   very simple. It's very formulaic. There's nothing to do but just open up, be focused 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=307)   and be equanimous with the heat and whatever emotions may be coming up. The basic Buddhist 
<br>[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=313)   paradigm is intensity plus equanimity equals flavor of purification. Sure enough, Native 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=322)   people call this a purification ceremony. I could see how it worked at that level. Then, 
<br>[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=332)   at a symbolic level, it was the whole idea of expansion and contraction, interplay of 
<br>[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=341)   Father Sky and Mother Earth. The pipe has the long stem but it has the earth bowl. You 
<br>[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=348)   could see every single thing that they did had that fundamental sense of a simultaneity 
<br>[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=354)   of affirmation, negation, expansion, contraction. In other words, it incorporated all of these 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=362)   levels simultaneously into one ceremony. I remember when it was intense and I'm crawling 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=374)   out and half passed out. The first thought that went through my mind is, and this was 
<br>[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=382)   a facetious thought, it had a facetious tone. The thought was, oh, this is what they mean 
<br>[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=390)   by primitive religion. The primitive was in quotes because, of course, it was the antithesis 
<br>[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=400)   of primitive. It was so multilayered and so subtle and so integrated. I guess when the 
<br>[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=410)   Europeans came here, they saw that the material culture was primitive. A stone axe is not 
<br>[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=418)   as good as a steel axe. They just assumed that the people were primitive in all ways 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=426)   and that their religion was primitive. It was amazing that they were able to do all 
<br>[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=434)   these things at once woven into this integrated experience. I got out of there and I just 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=442)   knew this is for me. That's how I got involved. If I were to say the relationship between 
<br>[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=451)   the Native American path and the Buddhist path, I would say that it's a complementarity. 
<br>[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=459)   They both move you in the direction of concentration and equanimity. The Buddhist one is sort of 
<br>[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=471)   like it's very systematic. That's good. It's sort of a very personal experience. 
<br>[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=479)   It's sort of not all that flamboyant or fun. You're just sitting there dealing with stuff. 
<br>[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=487)   Whereas the Native ceremonies are shared. There's a social context. It's fun. You're 
<br>[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=493)   singing and you're talking and you're, oh, me talk for y'all singing. You can just 
<br>[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=498)   let it all hang out. You get to learn another language. You're singing and you're drumming 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=504)   and it's sort of flashy and interesting. I would say for me, the Buddhist practice is 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=512)   the substance that will always be the cake. I like to have some frosting and that's 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HpHtzo8ds&t=518)   the Native American ceremonies.
