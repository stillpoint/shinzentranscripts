<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=0)  部隊全体全体 
<br>[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=12)   Whole body. 
<br>[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=32)   Forearms. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=35)   OK, good. 
<br>[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=37)   Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions. 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=42)   Would you say at this time that there's very much 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=48)   mental chatter going on, or it's more quiet in your head? 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=54)   Quiet. 
<br>[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=54)   It's pretty quiet? 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=56)   OK, good. 
<br>[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=57)   Would you say at this time that you have very much 
<br>[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=61)   mental imagery going on, or is the mental screen 
<br>[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=64)   more in a blank state? 
<br>[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=67)   Imagery. 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=68)   You have images. 
<br>[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=69)   What sort of images do you have? 
<br>[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=71)   It's images of your body or? 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=74)   My body. 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=74)   The body-related images? 
<br>[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=76)   Good. 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=77)   That's a very natural reaction, and once again, 
<br>[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=80)   excellent detection. 
<br>[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=83)   The sense that we have a body comes about 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=85)   through a combination of actual sensations in the body 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=89)   and then mental pictures of the body. 
<br>[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=92)   So just let those mental images be there, 
<br>[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=94)   but in the background as you focus on the actual sensations. 
<br>[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=99)   Now, we're working with the secondary physical sensations 
<br>[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=103)   of your chronic discomfort, chronic pain situation. 
<br>[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=111)   I have one other question. 
<br>[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=113)   At this time, are there any emotional sensations 
<br>[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=116)   associated with this? 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=117)   Any qualities like impatience, fear, 
<br>[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=122)   teariness, that kind of thing? 
<br>[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=124)   Or is your emotional body fairly peaceful? 
<br>[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=131)   It's fairly peaceful. 
<br>[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=133)   OK, good. 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=135)   If you have a lot of mental talk or emotional sensations 
<br>[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=142)   reactive to what was going on, which can, of course, 
<br>[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=146)   happen sometimes, that would be something else 
<br>[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=149)   we could work with. 
<br>[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=150)   We could work with your feel-image-talk reactions. 
<br>[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=154)   But right now, it seems like that that's not 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=156)   too much in the way. 
<br>[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=157)   So we're going to just stay with the physicality of the body. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=163)   Those secondary sensations that I'm having you focus on, 
<br>[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=168)   do they seem more or less stable? 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=171)   Or are they more sort of flowing and like an energy 
<br>[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=175)   kind of thing? 
<br>[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=176)   Are they more like solid and particulate like thing? 
<br>[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=182)   Would you say they're? 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=185)   They're pretty much solid. 
<br>[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=188)   I'm aware of them at all times. 
<br>[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=191)   It just shifts the awareness. 
<br>[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=193)   So your awareness shifts, but the sensations themselves 
<br>[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=196)   don't particularly flow or vibrate as a kind of energy. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=201)   No. 
<br>[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=201)   OK, good. 
<br>[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=202)   It could happen on occasion that they do. 
<br>[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=207)   And if that does happen, that's something significant 
<br>[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=210)   that you can focus on. 
<br>[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=211)   Has that ever happened in working with your body 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=214)   experience, that it became fluid? 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=217)   Yes. 
<br>[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=217)   OK, so you know what I'm talking about. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=219)   It's not happening now. 
<br>[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=220)   It doesn't have to happen. 
<br>[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=222)   But if it does, that's a significant experience 
<br>[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=225)   that I call flow. 
<br>[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=226)   And you can go with that if you wish. 
<br>[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=231)   OK, I'd like you to bring your attention back 
<br>[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=236)   to the primary area, the two primary areas where we started. 
<br>[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=242)   It's possible that those areas are exactly the same as they 
<br>[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=247)   were before in terms of intensity, solidity, 
<br>[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=251)   and so forth. 
<br>[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=253)   It's also possible that there's been a change. 
<br>[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=255)   They might be more intense, less intense, more solid, less 
<br>[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=258)   solid, more sort of coagulated or more thinned out. 
<br>[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=269)   Would you say that the two secondary areas are pretty much 
<br>[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=273)   the same as when we started? 
<br>[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=275)   Or have they changed in some direction? 
<br>[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=278)   Well, they've changed. 
<br>[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=280)   Can you describe the nature of the change? 
<br>[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=282)   I'm not even aware of them at the moment. 
<br>[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=284)   They've sort of vanished? 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=285)   They've vanished. 
<br>[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=285)   Remember I mentioned how detecting and totally opening 
<br>[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=290)   up to the secondary spread could sometimes dissipate 
<br>[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=295)   the pressure from the primary? 
<br>[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=297)   Remember I mentioned that? 
<br>[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=298)   Well, you just experienced that. 
<br>[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=302)   It's pretty cool, isn't it? 
<br>[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=303)   Has that ever happened to you before like this? 
<br>[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=305)   Not like this. 
<br>[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=307)   Did you ever work with the secondary sensations 
<br>[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=309)   in this systematic way previously? 
<br>[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=311)   OK. 
<br>[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=312)   Well, then I would say you learned 
<br>[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=314)   something pretty significant and in a relatively short period 
<br>[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=317)   of time. 
<br>[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=319)   You can open your eyes if you wish and just sort of stay 
<br>[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=322)   with the momentum of that. 
<br>[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=325)   That was excellent work. 
<br>[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=328)   Any questions about that experience? 
<br>[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=337)   The flow, when I said solid, it seemed to me 
<br>[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=342)   then as soon as I said it, it started to flow around. 
<br>[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=345)   Oh, I see. 
<br>[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=346)   Just thinking in those terms caused a fluidity. 
<br>[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=350)   Can you still be aware of it as we're speaking? 
<br>[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=352)   Yes, definitely. 
<br>[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=353)   It's moving all over. 
<br>[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=355)   Yeah, so now it's sort of turning 
<br>[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=356)   into an energy experience. 
<br>[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=358)   And even the secondaries are not that uncomfortable. 
<br>[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=361)   No. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=362)   Yeah. 
<br>[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=362)   Well, you can remember what we did, remember the strategy. 
<br>[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=367)   Because a lot of it, remember I asked you a lot of questions? 
<br>[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=370)   And that was in order to pick an optimal strategy to start with 
<br>[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=374)   and based on what you told me, seemed to me, OK, 
<br>[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=377)   we'll go with the secondaries, see what happens. 
<br>[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=380)   And two of the classic results, the dissipation of pressure 
<br>[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=384)   from the primary and a sense of fluidity 
<br>[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=388)   occurred in a relatively short period of time. 
<br>[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=391)   So we were lucky in a sense. 
<br>[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=394)   It doesn't always quite work that easily. 
<br>[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=396)   Some might take hours or even days sometimes, 
<br>[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=399)   but we sort of lucked out. 
<br>[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=401)   But you can remember and you can replicate this on your own. 
<br>[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=405)   You remember the sequence that we went through 
<br>[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=407)   and you remember the categories, their definitions, 
<br>[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=409)   and the ways of working with them. 
<br>[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=411)   Well, that's very cool. 
<br>[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=412)   Any questions or other things you'd like to comment on? 
<br>[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=416)   You got anything more? 
<br>[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=419)   The first one's always free. 
<br>[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=421)   There'll be a charge for the next one. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=424)   That was terrific. 
<br>[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=424)   OK, well, very good. 
<br>[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=426)   So there you have, actually, I got to be honest, 
<br>[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=430)   it doesn't always work this easily. 
<br>[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=433)   But there you have a classic example 
<br>[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=436)   of what I call an interactive algorithmic guidance. 
<br>[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=442)   It's interactive because I took feedback, I asked questions. 
<br>[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=445)   It's algorithmic because I was following a flowchart. 
<br>[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=448)   In my own mind, I had a range of strategies 
<br>[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=453)   that involve looping and branching. 
<br>[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=455)   And depending on the kinds of answers I would have gotten, 
<br>[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=458)   we would have gone in very different directions. 
<br>[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=460)   If he'd had a lot of thoughts and emotions 
<br>[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=462)   about what was going on, we probably 
<br>[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=464)   would have started with that, et cetera, et cetera. 
<br>[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=467)   So this will give you an idea of the approach to mindfulness 
<br>[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=473)   that I call interactive, algorithmic, personalized 
<br>[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=480)   coaching. 
<br>[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=481)   And it's my contention that this way of working 
<br>[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=484)   is the optimal way both to teach people the skills 
<br>[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=489)   and also to support them when they 
<br>[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=491)   have to apply those skills to real life challenges, 
<br>[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=495)   such as emotions or physical discomfort. 
<br>[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=500)   So thanks, Rich. 
<br>[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=501)   That was great. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=502)   Thank you. 
<br>[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=502)   We got it for the record. 
<br>[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=504)   You're beaming. 
<br>[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=505)   I know. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=506)   Excellent. 
<br>[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=506)   Extraordinary. 
<br>[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=507)   Very good. 
<br>[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=508)   Well, we don't call it the miracle of mindfulness 
<br>[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=511)   for nothing. 
<br>[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=512)   If you look back, you'll see that I didn't have 
<br>[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=515)   you change anything at all. 
<br>[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=518)   That's what's so weird about it. 
<br>[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=519)   All I had you do was be precise, concentrated, and matter of 
<br>[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=524)   fact. 
<br>[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=525)   We didn't try to change anything or make anything go away. 
<br>[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=529)   And yet, because of bringing that threefold skill 
<br>[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=531)   set to this experience, suddenly there's 
<br>[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=535)   a reduction of suffering and even 
<br>[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=537)   a little bit of a pleasant kind of energy associated with it. 
<br>[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cearYQbXCds&t=542)   That's the miracle of mindfulness.
