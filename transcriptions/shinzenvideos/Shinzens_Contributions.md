<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=0)   What is unique and important? 
<br>[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=7)   When I look at the different kinds of things that I like to teach, 
<br>[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=13)   I'll sometimes ask myself, what is unique and important? 
<br>[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=20)   Are there some things I've come up with that no one came up with 
<br>[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=24)   and that may be important historically? 
<br>[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=31)   I think there are. 
<br>[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=35)   One is the notion that 
<br>[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=42)   three attentional skills, concentration, clarity, equanimity, as I've defined them, 
<br>[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=48)   give you everything that you need with no extra baggage 
<br>[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=55)   to completely analyze any form of contemplative-based psychospiritual growth 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=63)   and also to compare all historical traditions 
<br>[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=74)   of contemplative-based psychospiritual growth. 
<br>[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=79)   You can analyze every single path in terms of the extent to which 
<br>[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=85)   and the way in which, if at all, it talks about each one of these skills. 
<br>[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=93)   That is like a three-dimensional analysis that can be used 
<br>[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=97)   both for the practical of an individual's meditation practice 
<br>[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=105)   but also as a framework for a systematic theory of world mysticism. 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=115)   I think that's probably important and it's unique, I think. 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=125)   Another thing is what I just mentioned, 
<br>[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=132)   realizing that mental image, mental talk, and body emotion work together as a system. 
<br>[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=141)   What I essentially have done is take the early Buddhist idea, 
<br>[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=147)   something that goes back either to the Buddha or to just a few centuries after the Buddha, 
<br>[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=152)   something very associated with Theravada, 
<br>[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=156)   which is the notion that if you untangle the strands of self, you get free. 
<br>[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=163)   Well, I'm going to claim that inner Sikhir feel represents 
<br>[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=171)   the most tangible and simplest way to implement that divide and conquer 
<br>[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=178)   or untangle and be free. 
<br>[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=179)   Furthermore, that it probably maps onto functional neuroanatomy 
<br>[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=185)   and therefore could be the basis, once again, 
<br>[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=189)   for a biophysical theory of enlightenment sometime in the future. 
<br>[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=195)   So that's important. 
<br>[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=198)   There's one other thing, which is if you want to look for a biological basis for enlightenment, 
<br>[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=214)   I'm going to make a guess. This is just a guess. 
<br>[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=219)   I might whistle another tune in a year or two, 
<br>[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=224)   but I'm going to, for the record, say, 
<br>[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=229)   look at the basal ganglia. 
<br>[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=234)   Okay, so that could be the single most important thing I ever said in my life. 
<br>[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j--h90PKvc&t=243)   Or not. We'll see.
