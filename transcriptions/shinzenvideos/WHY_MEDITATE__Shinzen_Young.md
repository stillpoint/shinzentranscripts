<br>[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=0)   Meditation optimizes five fundamental dimensions of human happiness. 
<br>[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=14)   The first dimension is reducing suffering, the ability to experience unavoidable pain 
<br>[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=23)   with less problem. 
<br>[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=27)   The second is elevation of fulfillment, the ability to experience even small pleasures 
<br>[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=34)   with enormous satisfaction. 
<br>[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=38)   The third dimension where meditation impacts is self-understanding. 
<br>[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=44)   It's actually helpful to understand yourself at a psychological level, but where meditation 
<br>[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=50)   really shines is to understand who you are at the deepest level. 
<br>[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=56)   The fourth dimension is meditation will help you make objective changes in behavior. 
<br>[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=63)   So if there's something you're doing that you need to stop doing or something you should 
<br>[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=68)   be doing that you're procrastinating or putting off, you can use meditation skills to behave 
<br>[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=77)   more skillfully in the world. 
<br>[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=82)   Reduce suffering, elevate fulfillment, understand yourself at all levels, including the deepest, 
<br>[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=89)   improve behavior, and ultimately to find within yourself a spirit of serving or contributing 
<br>[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=100)   to the happiness of others that comes from a spontaneous love. 
<br>[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=107)   And actually, that spirit of love and service is a consequence of success in the other four 
<br>[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=115)   dimensions. 
<br>[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=117)   As you suffer less or more fulfilled, as you understand who you are, and as you have a 
<br>[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=125)   handle on changing how you carry yourself, all of that sums up ultimately in how you 
<br>[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-6la3AlEnE&t=135)   contribute to making this world a better place.
