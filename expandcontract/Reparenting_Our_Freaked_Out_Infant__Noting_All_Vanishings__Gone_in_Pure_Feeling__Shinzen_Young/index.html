<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>What is the significance of Vanishing? I was focusing on vanishings, and the vanishings became ubiquitous, just like it's everywhere. But in the past, when I've noted vanishings, say with the breath, it's actually been a sort of soothing experience with sort of an afterglow of peacefulness. I found this experience of noting vanishing to be highly agitating. I think the implied question is, what does that mean and what should I do? Uncomfortably stimulating, agitating. Noting nothing whatsoever has resulted in a lot of uncomfortable something. How closely correlated would you say, and a certain amount of guessing may be involved on this, how much correlation would you say there is between the fact that you were noting vanishing and the fact that you're sort of hyped up? In other words, does it seem highly correlated with that, that that really had something to do with it? Or would it be more, well, the potential was there and I might be hyped up because of other things. I'd like you to make a guess. Is it because you said, well, I'm sort of excited about this prospect and that, and I haven't had the sugar fix or the coffee fix, so it's not that, but it might have been some other things you sort of intimated. Do you think that the noting of vanishing played a large role in this, or other factors may have entered in? The answer, not sure at all, is completely valid. <br><br> There's a pretty strong correlation between the paying attention to nothing and a lot of agitating something. That's good. That's what I wanted to determine. <br><br> Or it may be uncomfortable, but it's good as far as practice goes. Is it mostly, well, you report a lot of talk, but would you say that the agitation is primarily in feel, image, or talk? It's primarily in feel. I don't want to put words in your mouth, so correct me if this is wrong, but the gist that I'm getting is I was noting vanishings, which usually is a peaceful experience for me, and I usually note vanishings just in the breath, the ends of the in and out breaths or external sounds, but two things happened this time that are very different. <br><br> First of all, the vanishing globalized to it's like everything's vanishing, and secondly, it was agitating and specifically agitating at the level of pure emotion in the body. Did I more or less nail it? Okay. That's called precision. <br><br> We have a vocabulary that allows for this kind of precision. Now that I've honed it down to that, I can give a pretty confident answer with regards to the two implicit questions, why is this happening and what should I do about it? Why it's happening is because you really did the technique well. The vanishing points us to the most primordial, primitive experience that a human being can have, which is a non-human experience, and actually the ultimate grounding, groundless grounding. However, if it points us to the ultimately primordial or primitive experience that any human being can have, so primitive that it's not human, there must also be the second most primitive experience that a human being can have, that's pretty close to it. That is definitely a human experience, and that is the experience of primordial chaotic feel of the infant. You died a thousand little times, petit mort, little deaths, into the gons. <br><br> When you came back, you came back as a little infant body with freak-out chaotic feel. That's really, really, really good. That's the good news. Why? Well, that in and of itself wouldn't be good news, but that combined with the fact that you're an experienced meditator is very good news. Because then you just note feel and its vanishings. You'll be working through the first thing that separated you from your spiritual source, the very first thing, in the first weeks and hours of life. You get to work at that level. <br><br> All you have to do is note feel and its vanishing, and all the other vanishings. See, right now you're an adult meditator. Then you were a helpless infant. Now you've got a super adult. <br><br> You're better than an adult. The adult meditator will apply the technique of note vanishing and include the feel vanishing in that technique. The adult meditator will therefore work through that primordial level of freak-out of the infant. <br><br> That's the linchpin on the freak-out of the adult, and of the teenager, and of all the intermediate levels from infant to adult. Sasaki Roshi says that the first thing that happens after zero breaks apart is expansion and contraction pull in opposite directions, and they cause a creation of a cleft of pure space. But because expansion is pulling out and contraction is pulling in, that space vibrates. It vibrates into pure heat of feel. Jō netsu in Japanese. <br><br> Jō means pure feeling, unalloyed with anything else, and netsu means heat. He says if you can detect that, that is the beginning of the self. That's the primordium of self. The true primordium of self is the space, and the source of the space is spaceless. <br><br> But the first thing that is in some sense a self, and not impersonal, is that pure heat of feel.
