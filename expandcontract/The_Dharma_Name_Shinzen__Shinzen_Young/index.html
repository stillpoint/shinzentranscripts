<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Okay, so that's how you write my name in Japanese, which is Chinese. Chinese read in the Japanese pronunciation. The Sino-Japanese readings are Xin Zhen, but in standard Mandarin Chinese, the characters are pronounced Zhen Shan. In Sino-Korean, it would be Chin Sun, and in Sino-Vietnamese, it would be Zhen Tian. Written the same, means the same, but pronounced differently depending on the region of East Asia. What happens is when you become a Buddhist monk, they give you a Dharma name, just like if you become a Christian monk or a nun, you get like a religious name. So my teacher, before he made me a Buddhist monk in 1970, just before the ceremony, he came up to me with this slip of paper and he said, this is the Dharma name I'm going to give you, and I want you to use it, keep it, make it your name that you'll use for the rest of your life, but I want to know, are you okay with this name? So I look at the piece of paper and I pretty much freak out. See, written Chinese jumps off the page if you can read it, because it's iconic and it's graphic. So it's like Chin means authentic or true, and Zhen means good or goodness. It's like authenticity, truth and goodness. As I'm looking at it, I say, truth and goodness? I could never live up to that name. So I said, I'm afraid I'll namae make, namae make in Japanese means I won't be able to live up to the name. And he said, never mind that, is it okay? Are you willing to take this name? I said, well, I guess so. So hence the name. What he meant to convey to me was many levels of meaning simultaneously, as is possible with the Chinese characters. On one hand, he was saying, I'm sort of giving you the whole lineage to take back to the United States, because the Zhen, by the way, this is not the Zen of Zen Buddhism. There's a good example. See, it's a completely different character. I'll show you the Zen of Zen Buddhism in a minute. The Zhen is part of his name. His name was Zen Kyo, meaning good teaching. The Shin was the name of the prince, imperial prince, who founded the temple where I lived, or where we lived, on Mount Koya. It was a thousand years old. And Prince Shin-yo, written with this, was a son of an emperor who started this particular site on Mount Koya about a thousand years ago. So he's giving me the name of the guy that started the temple a thousand years ago, the first character of that. And he's giving me the first character of his own name, sort of saying, OK, here's a thousand years of lineage to carry back to the United States. Now in addition to the intrinsic meaning, there's all this other level of responsibility and et cetera. Prince Shin-yo, S-H-I-N-N-Y-O, you can look it up in the Wikipedia. Very interesting person. He was the first Japanese. We're talking ninth century AD, so over a thousand years ago. He was the first Japanese to attempt to leave Japan and visit the Western world. Many, many Japanese for centuries had gone to Korea and China itself to study. But because the lineage of practice is Shingon, and that is an Indic lineage, the lineage I was originally ordained in, that's Vajrayana actually, Prince Shin-yo in essence wanted to go back to the source itself. He wanted to go to India to study directly with Indic masters rather than secondhand with Chinese or Koreans. India is the West from the East Asian point of view. He never made it though. You have to realize in the ninth century, even to travel to China from Japan was to take your life in your hands because the seas are very rough and it's just dangerous. So it was actually a pretty outrageous notion to be able to travel, given the primitive and dangerous conditions and the unknown conditions, to be able to travel from Japan to India. Indeed, it was not feasible. He was killed in the Singapore area, Malaysia area, never got any further. Anyway, just a little bit of history. But then there's another whole level of meaning, which is this represents the twin pillars of the universal spiritual path around the world because the truth or the authenticity piece, that stands in the Buddhist tradition for the wisdom. In the Taoist tradition, somebody who had realized the Tao, who had transcended the somethingness of self and the materiality of the world, such a person was referred to as a zhenren. That's the Taoist term for an enlightened master. Very simple, authentic person. This implies sort of get over yourself in the world. The shan is ordinary goodness in the sense of a mensch, a good person. It's improvement, both in terms of improving your shila, your personal character, and in terms of improving the world through bodhisattva service is implied by this character. So an ordinary good person, what we might colloquially call in North American English a mensch from the Yiddish, is called a zhenren. So what he was basically saying is like, I give you a name that exemplifies the essence of the path.</p>
