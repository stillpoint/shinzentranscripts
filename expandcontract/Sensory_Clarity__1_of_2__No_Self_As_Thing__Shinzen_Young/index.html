<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>There is a famous scripture which serves as a Buddhist FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, document or might be in some ways looked upon as a Buddhist catechism. And it's called the Questions of King Melinda. It's in the Pali literature. Melinda was a historical person. And interestingly enough, although his questions are recorded in Buddhist literature preserved in Southeast Asia, King Melinda was a westerner. He was King Menandros, who was part of what was left in Northwest India after Alexander the Great died. There were these Greek rulers. We say India, but this is India in its broadest sense. It would now be part of Afghanistan, actually, Bactria, where his kingdom was centered. This is a sort of early dialogue between East and West. Because he asks a series of questions to a Buddhist monk named Nagasena. Before this whole discussion starts, Nagasena asks the king, are you willing to have a discussion with me and perhaps have disagreements and whatever, and even debate? Are you willing to do it the way an academic would do it? Or are you going to do it the way a king would do it? And Nagasena says, what do you mean? He said, well, if academics have a disagreement and one sort of gets the better of the other or shows them to be incorrect, it's just, you know, they just accept that. If a king is shown to be incorrect, he executes you. So which way are you going to do it? Like an academic or like he's like, you know, because if you're going to do it like a king, I'm out of here. He may have been an arhat, but he wasn't stupid with regards to the preservation of his low self by his gandas. So the king says, who are you and whatever? And he says, well, I'm called Nagasena, but there is no thing called Nagasena. And then the king tries to sort of trip him up on something. And so then Nagasena makes this metaphor that's very famous in Buddhist literature. He says, well, your majesty, when you arrived here, how did you get here? Well, I was in my chariot. And then he goes through all the different parts of the chariot. And he says, well, is there really a thing called the chariot? Are the wheels the chariot, the hub, the bed, the axle tree, the yoke, et cetera, et cetera. He goes through all these parts, and the king has to agree, no, that's not the chariot. That's not the chariot. And then Nagasena says, and it's the same with us. There's just rupa, vedana, sanjna, sankhara, and vijnana. That doesn't constitute a self called Nagasena. And the king sort of gets it in this scripture and says, OK, you're right. You win on that one. I guess I can see your point. The point being that chariot as a thing is just a convention. Usually I find the arhat Nagasena's argument unconvincing myself. Does that sound arrogant and irreverent? If it were really, really, really convincing, then all the philosophers of the world would be saying, these guys are right. But in fact, there's a lot of philosophical objections to this argument. If you get some professional philosophers in and let them get to work on it, they might really tear it apart. I think he's right. There is no thing called a self. I'm not just quite sure that this particular metaphor clinches it as a proof, the way it is portrayed as doing in the scripture. But I would like to clinch it for the world so that there are no quibbles or objections and everybody agrees. Whoa, yeah, can't deny that. I would like to suggest another angle of attack on this idea. I agree with the idea. I think it is one of the most important ideas in the history of the world. One of the things that is noticeable in this argument is that rupa means the physical body. It's not a sensory experience. We know it exists through a sensory experience, but it's not being presented as a sensory experience. It's being presented as a concept, body as matter. Samskaras are not direct sensory experiences for most meditators. They can be for some meditators. You can directly experience it. Consciousness as an entity in its own right, as opposed to consciousness in a certain flavor, such as Tutsite sound-feel-image-talk, that's not ordinarily experienced by most meditators. What if we just take the parts that are direct sensory experience? Why would we want to do that? Because well, direct sensory experience as opposed to concepts can be brain-imaged. My idea is let's take either broadly Vedanātami body, that is to say physical and emotional sensations, so that would be touch-feel, as they do within the Upa-Khin lineage, or let's really look at the most gripping part of Vedanā, which is the emotional type pleasures and pains that we go through. Let's take the feel part and let's make sanjna, or concept, not a concept, but a sensory experience, image-talk. So let's sort of streamline the model to feel-image-talk. Now I didn't just pull this out of nowhere. There is an implication in my original school of Buddhism, Shingon, which is a form of Vajrayana, that the sense of self arises through mental image, internal talk, and body sensations, because the practices that are done in Shingon to have an experience of oneness with the deity involve the physical type sensations in the form of mudras, mental images where you visualize the deity in front and also yourself as a deity, and you visualize your surroundings as the palace of the deity, and you replace your internal talk with the mantra. And then you get the emotional feeling of the deity, whatever that tone is. So there's an implication that body image-talk broadly and feel-image-talk more narrowly, that these are sort of natural building blocks of identity. If people tease apart the feel-image-talk, which is, there's nothing conceptual in that, that's completely a sensory skill. They get the same insight, oh, there's just feel-image-talk, there's no thing called a self here. So that's the way I have people work with this. Now instead of using a classic metaphor of the chariot, I use a much more homey, like your TV set or a computer monitor, not the liquid crystal ones, but the CRT ones. That's my metaphor.</p>
