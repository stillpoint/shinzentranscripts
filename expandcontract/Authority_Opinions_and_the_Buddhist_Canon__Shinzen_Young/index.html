<p>I hear that sometimes people ask, well, what would Shinzetsu say about this? That gives me pleasant sensations in a sense, pleasant self-referential sensations, pleasant feel. But also, immediately when I hear that people say things like that in my talk space is, don't they realize these are just my casual opinions about things? Don't they realize how little I know about enlightenment? Don't they realize how little any teacher knows about enlightenment? I understand that people want to appeal to authority. It's convenient in a sense. Basically, there's traditionally in India and also in the Western world, three bases for knowing things. There's direct experience, there's logical inference, and then there is reliable authority. What is distinctive about the Buddha as a teacher is that he rejected reliable authority as a basis of knowing. He essentially said it's direct experience and logical inference. Just because a very good person says something doesn't mean it's necessarily true. Just because some ancient scripture that everybody believes in says something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. And just because somebody that's meditated for 50 years or 60 years says something doesn't necessarily mean it's true. It's their casual opinion. It's the best they can come up with. And I think it's really important to keep that in mind. Does that mean that you shouldn't listen to what these teachers say? No. We have to listen because, yes, there's a lot that can be learned. But it also has to be taken not as some sort of authoritative pronouncement. It's at best a finger that can sort of point, and yes, this person has some experiences that I don't, or has more experience than I do, so yeah, I can listen to what they say. But to go beyond that, to think that, to make it carry more weight than just that person's casual opinion or best that they can come up with, I think is to miss the point. We just do our best to formulate things as best we can. So I just wanted to say a couple words along those lines. Yes, you can make use of authority to a certain degree, but I don't think that we need to give it more clout than it really deserves. Also it's sometimes asked, well, how does what this teacher or that teacher say map onto what's in the scriptures or what's in the canon? I guess the Western religions, the Abrahamic religions, tend to call it the scriptures, but in Buddhism they call it the canon. Means the same thing. Unfortunately, the people that are responsible for the Buddhist canon, the Buddha, his immediate disciples and so forth, are not now alive, meaning we can't dialogue with them. If you ever come to a retreat with me, what you'll see is characteristic of the way I teach is that when people ask me questions, very seldom do I just give an answer. I sometimes do. But in most cases I find I have to ask a little more. What did you mean by that? I think I understand what you're saying, but it could be this or it could be that. Could you clarify? It's very difficult for me to just answer a question directly. I find that interaction is needed. A back and forth is needed. There is no way that we can have a back and forth with the Buddha or his immediate disciples. It's one way. All we've got is what is in these books. These books were not written down right away. It was quite a while before they were written down. Some people might claim, well, it was all perfectly memorized word for word. There is something of that memorizing tradition in the Indic way of doing things. But the fact is, even if it was word for word, that's still not enough. Not really. There would have to be a back and forth to see really how does what, say, I, as Shin Zen Yang, am teaching, how does that map on to the Buddha? I'd have to be able to dialogue with him. And I can't. He's gone. So we can look to the scriptures, and yes, we can get a lot from it, and we should. But once again, I have rather modest expectations with regards to how really sharp the communication can be between the scriptures or the canon and us, given that it's a one-way street. And so it's a kind of humility to understand that, yeah, you can make use of it, but you can't dialogue with it.
