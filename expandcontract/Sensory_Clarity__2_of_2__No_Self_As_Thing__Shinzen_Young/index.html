<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>You're watching TV and there's like something white on the TV screen. And this is assuming it's a CRT, a cathode ray tube. And I come in and I say, there is no thing called white on that screen. And you say, are you crazy? Just look, it's white. And I say, are you sure? Here is a magnifying glass. We agree that this magnifying glass does not change what is there. It does, however, increase resolution. Resolution is the ability to separate things that ordinarily fall together in perception. That's all that resolution means. You all know the difference between a high resolution screen and a low resolution screen. The large amounts of data coming through allow for separation of points that truly are separated, but they would tend to fall together. So we go up and we look at the white and lo and behold, as we get closer, the perception white goes away and the perception red, green, blue arises. The Buddha said, if you look very carefully, the perception I am goes away and the perception five aggregates of identification arises. Or in another formulation, the perception body goes away and the perception four elements, earth, water, air, fire, arises. Another metaphor, chop up a cow. If you can believe this, it's in the Buddhist scriptures. It's like, you can't believe this is there, but chop up a cow. Can you imagine chopping up a cow in public in modern India? Well, apparently in the Buddha's day it was done. That'd get you in a bit of trouble. He said, suppose a butcher went to a public square and took a cow and began to chop up the cow. At some point, the perception cow would disappear and the perception meat would arise. That's actually in the Buddhist scriptures. What he says is, it's even more interesting. He doesn't say just any butcher. He says, suppose a very skillful butcher, who really knew what they were doing, were to very skillfully chop up this cow. Then, I guess if you don't know what you're doing, the perception meat won't arise. The perception of, oh my God. But a skillful butcher, the perception cow will go away and the perception meat will arise. So, I think you see my metaphor here. The perception white goes away and the perception red, green, blue arises. Well, I would claim that when you look very carefully at at least your core subjective self of thought and emotion, the perception that that is a thing and I am it will go away. The perception feel, image, talk that aren't me will arise. So that's my metaphor. Why I think that this is worth looking into is this is 100% a perceptual research project. There's nothing conceptual in it. It's not like you have to conceive of the five aggregates. Like, oh yeah, there must be habit forces within me. Yeah, there must be a thing called consciousness. Yes, there's the physical body, etc. etc. This is a phenomenon of perceptual psychology and therefore is amenable to the research methods that we would use for any other sensory perception. We don't know how red, green, blue mix to produce something that is none of them, to wit white. We don't know how the visual system does it. I mean, we know in some vague ways some things about the circuitry. But we do not really understand how an illusory emergent property arises. But someday we will. It is possible, I am choosing my words extremely carefully, it is possible that when a person resolves I am-ness into feel-image-talk, something like the resolving of white into red, green, blue takes place. Notice I said something like. I don't know because we don't know about the red, green, blue thing. Is white there or not? What do you say about something that disappears as soon as you look closely and reappears as soon as you are not paying close attention? What is the existential status of that white? Does it exist? Well, if you don't look carefully it does. But then if you look carefully it doesn't, so it sort of exists but doesn't exist. Something like that may be going on when people that have used my methods get a sense of freedom from their limited identity. The perception I am a thing goes away and the perception feel-image-talk arises. If indeed these are analogous then it is now possible to turn the lens of science on that perceptual shift. Well, it's not now possible but it will be possible in the next 50 years, 100 years, 200 years. And maybe we can come up with a very convincing argument that yes, indeed, the Buddha was right and Nagasena was right. If we were to take this metaphor further, if we were to go beyond the perception red, green, blue and deeply penetrate what is red, green and blue light, where it's light coming out, right? There are three different flavors or colors we call it. If you ask what do they all have in common, at a deep level, what's red, green and blue light? What's light? What's colored light? These are waves of radiant electromagnetic energy. And from the point of view that they are radiant electromagnetic energy, they're just different frequencies of the same phenomenon. The word vipassana means vipassana, means to see separately in the sense of separating out strands. But v in addition to apart, vipassana means to see apart. But v has another force as a prefix, it means through or into. So first you vipassana in the sense of separate the strands, but then your awareness soaks into those strands and you start to experience feel-image-talk as vibrating space, which is sort of interesting because radiant electromagnetic energy, if you ask a physicist, they'll say, well, it's sort of vibrating space. Now I don't know how far we can take this metaphor. I'm not so naive as to suggest that it's anything more than an interesting parallel, but it is an interesting parallel. So after you've teased out the strands, the concentration, clarity and equanimity go into the strands and the strands start to present themselves as vibrating void. And then there's no distinction between feel-image-talk because they're just vibrating void. The focus in technique harkens back to the early Buddhist notion of separate the strands and then penetrate the strands and see their empty impermanent nature.</p>
