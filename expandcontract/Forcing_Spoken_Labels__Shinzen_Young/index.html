<p>The forcing yourself to say the labels has caused the invisible force of scatter to come up as a tangible sensation of impatience. You can detect it in the body, right? Now start noting that. You can either note the impatient locations or just note it as feel if you want to use a generic technique. So let's say that you're noting feel image talk, okay? And the image and talk go away because you're forcing yourself to say the labels out loud. However, what happens to feel is that now there's an agitated, uncomfortable quality of feel. So then you would note feel, feel with spoken labels and the more you speak, the more that discomfort comes up. But that's good because that's observable. That's a somatic quality. It has location. It has intensity. It has flavor in the body. You can observe it and you can open up to it. The whole idea in doing something like spoken labels is to take invisible patterns of force that scatter our attention and transmute them into observable patterns of sensation or perhaps also image talk, but usually it's an agitated sensation, an observable pattern of sensation that you can then work with because invisible patterns of force are extremely difficult to work with. It's what you described. They just got you. It's like you're observing and now you're not observing. You're not on the edge of the stream. You have entered the stream and not in the good sense of that term. You're not being carried by the stream of enlightenment. You're being drowned in the stream of karma. Now you're uncomfortable in the body. That means that the spoken labels have made an invisible pattern of force that's been scattering you into an observable, trackable pattern of sensation, albeit perhaps a very uncomfortable sensation, but it is still trackable and you can note that sensation. What is trackable eventually becomes tractable and you will have worked through the invisible scattering force, which is intractable. One of the very elegant and clever features of mindfulness practice is, I repeat, it takes invisible and intractable problem, which is forces are controlling me that I don't like and there's nothing I can do about it. It transforms that problem, a problem of dealing with invisible forces, into the problem of observing actual body sensations. Then as you equantimize that, you solve that problem, that translates back into, now those forces no longer have a hold on you. Huge fundamental tool. That's why it may have sounded cavalier and even mean when I said, oh, that's great. You're all agitated and miserable because you're doing the spoken labels, but it was neither cavalier nor mean. That's the name of the game. Solid mouthing, sotto voce labeling. If that doesn't work, then stay away from the zendo for half a day and just force yourself to do the labels.
