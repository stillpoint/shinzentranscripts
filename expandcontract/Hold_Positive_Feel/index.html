<p>Hi, my name's Kathleen and I've been meditating with Shinsen for almost 10 years. And I recently had a situation in my life that really threw me off course. My brother went into the hospital, he was taken to the emergency room and we were told that his body had begun the dying process. Now he is a very young man and for us to be told that, it was really scary. We were told that his liver had gone into liver failure and that if his body did not start to show any signs of healing in the next 12 to 24 hours, he was going to go to the number one spot on the emergency liver transplant list in the entire southeast part of the United States. This shocked us. We're like, oh my goodness. Yesterday he was bee-bopping around the world and now he might die. So our family stayed there the entire day and into the night. But then I said to the family, I said, please, everyone go home, get a good night's sleep. He was unconscious. I said, get a good night's sleep. I will stay here and be with him tonight just in case he wakes up. They went home and what they didn't know is that I have this technique of holding positive states for a loved one. I decided to do a yaza, which is where you stay up all night long and you focus, for myself I decided to focus on these positive states. So I sat by his bedside and because of the situation I had a lot of feeling inside of me of love towards him. So at first I sat there and I radiated love towards him. I just sat there and I just focused on the love going out to him. I'm looking at him laying in a bed. I focused on the love going towards him. After a period of time, I couldn't feel the love inside my body. So then I started focusing on wonderful memories that we had had. I remember great times we had growing up and I would focus on that memory and then the love and the feeling would just radiate out of me towards him. I sat there for hours and felt so much love and gratitude for him in my life. About 2, 3 o'clock in the morning, the love kind of went away because of the exhaustion. I started to have talk of, you know, just, oh I'm tired, I want to sleep. But then by focusing on that talk and then changing that to love. Instead of going down the road of the negative talk, I focused on positive talk. I would just sit there and I would just say love and I'd feel the love going out to him. I'd go love, I love you so much. I mean, I would just, any loving thought or talk that I could say in my head to radiate towards my brother, that's what I did. You know, I live my life that I try to love people day to day and I try to be there for them and I try to cherish them. But I've never experienced a love that deep when I am in such a vulnerable state and he's in such a vulnerable state that to feel that love radiating towards him hour after hour. It was a great gift that he gave to me that night for me by using the whole positive interstates. It truly changed the way I feel about my brother. I have so much love and compassion in my heart for him and I feel like I love him on so much of a deeper level now. And I am just so grateful for him and for the love and for the time that we have shared. He has had a full recovery and I am so grateful for that. I know that without that technique I would have gone to the hospital, I would have suffered, I would have heard all the negative stuff that was happening. I would have heard he was going to die for this reason or that reason. I would have heard all of that negative stuff and I would have freaked out. I would have been in a panic state. I would not have been able to focus. I would have been so consumed with all the negativity of the situation that I just would have been in a huge ball of suffering. Because of this technique it turned a terrible negative situation in my life into a deepening of love for my brother. I am forever grateful for this technique.</p>
