There's the local stab, burn, tear kind of stuff. And it's like being beaten, like it's being, you get hit, you get like hit a whole bunch of times, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And then it just like, it ripples through the whole body, bang, bang, bang, bang. It's like bang, bang, bang, and then it goes bang, bang, bang, bang, local and global, right?
