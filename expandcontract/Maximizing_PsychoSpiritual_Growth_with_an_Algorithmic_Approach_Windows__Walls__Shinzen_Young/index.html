<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>We have four themes that are in the rectilinear configurations. So you work with your ordinary states, physical, emotional sensations, external sights, external sounds, internal mental pictures, internal talk. So that's a whole approach, a whole theme, and no touch, sight, sound, feel, image, talk. It's abbreviated in there. We also have a way of enjoying restful states. So you can note the corresponding restful states, physical relaxation, and so forth, relaxation, light, silence, peace, quiet. You can start there. You can start there. You can start anywhere. Now we've got explore dynamic states. So you can note flow. You can note vanishings. There's another way to work with restful experience, which is the do nothing. It's got like four themes, but there's actually six procedures, each of which has various versions, as you'll remember. So you can start anywhere, you can go anywhere. Well one way you might use it is you just pick one technique, one version, and that's all you're going to do. In that case, this represents a Sears Roebuck catalog of spiritual practices, and you decide to make one purchase, and that's it. So maybe you like noting restful states. So that's what you do, and you don't worry about all this other stuff. Another way to go about it is, well, you like several of them, and you arrange them in a workout sequence for yourself, like a nautilus cycle. Each one of these is a piece of workout equipment. Now those of you that were in the PM group process today, I gave you the full psycho-spiritual nautilus cycle. We started by noting ordinary states, sort of like, okay, we start at the coarse level of ordinary experience, untangle. Then we, okay, let's note the corresponding restful states, thinned out, a little more pleasant, because we're a little more settled now. Okay, now there could be flow in the ordinary or the restful, so we note the flow. Then we note the vanishings. Now we've got quite a momentum, so if we do nothing, there's likelihood that there'll be concentration, clarity, equanimity, even though we're not trying to make it be there, and indeed even a likelihood that there'll be quite a bit of restfulness and energy, even though we're not in any way intentionally doing anything. So we sort of like, okay, this is what in Catholicism would be called infused contemplation, more passive contemplation. You're not doing anything anymore, you're letting the source do you. That should take you into that. Where do you go from that? Where do you go after crucifixion? Only one place, resurrection. So you reanimate in a more positive way by a focus on positive. Now you could start back here again, right? It's a cycle. If you come back here, now you're just noting what is, but because you've been through this whole thing, what is is probably a little better than what it was an hour ago. And then you just cycle around, and cycle around, and cycle around. And it hits all the psycho-spiritual muscle groups. So the one I just showed went ordinary, rest, flow, vanishing, do nothing, positive, and then you can go back to ordinary. This was designed to make it easy for a person to interactively guide you. Once you have internalized these categories, if something comes up in the real world that blows you away, all you've got to do is call me or any facilitator that I've trained in this system, and you will be back on track lickety split. I mean within a half an hour. I don't care how big it is. I mean I don't care how big it is. This gives a standard vocabulary that a facilitator can be there to remind you. Most of us are not going to do the monastery thing. So how are you going to get the industrial strength experiences that people get when they expose themselves to the intensity of traditional monastic practice? How you're going to get it is, okay, you're not going to go to a monastery, but is the monastery going to come to you? You bet. You'll have an injury. You'll have an illness. You'll have something happen. You'll be betrayed. You will be betrayed. You will be mugged. Stuff is going to happen. Stuff is going to happen. When it happens, that's a monastery if you know how to use it as a monastery. But it may be a little hard to remember that you can do that, and it may be quite hard to remember exactly how to do that on your own. But if you call me or someone like me, and if you're already familiar with this system, we can get you on track very quickly. I do it every day. People call me. I just got mugged in L.A. at gunpoint. My son just got arrested. My best friend just committed suicide. Okay, so they have to talk about it a little bit, and then we get down to work.
