<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Yesterday I wrote out the, it just occurred to me to write the term for no-self in the Islamic tradition of Sufism which is Fana. Then it occurred to me it might be interesting to write, to look at all the words that are used by the meditating mystics around the world for their version of what humility is. So here we go. So we'll start where we started last night. So this is Arabic. It's pronounced Fana, F-A-N-A. And that's the technical term in the Sufi tradition for what in the Buddhist tradition is called no-self. So let's juxtapose with that Hebrew. It's also written from right to left. So this says Bitul Hayesh in Hebrew language. That would be romanized B-I-T-U-L-H-A-Y-E-S-H. Bitul means annihilation so very similar to Fana. And Ha means thee and yesh is somethingness. Somethingness of self, somethingness of world, or existence. Yesh is the common Hebrew word for exist. So the annihilation of the somethingness of self and world pretty much sums it up. By the way, after Bitul Hayesh comes Bria, that you once you annihilate the somethingness, then you become the doingness. So you are able to participate in the flip side of the annihilation, which is the moment by moment continuous arising of yesh, things, from I am the divine nothing. And Fana in the Sufi tradition has exactly the same thing. After Fana is something called Baka, which is now you're stabilized with the source and you can understand how the world is coming from God, Allah, and so forth. So very parallel type situations. So that's Islam, Judaism. Now let's look at Christianity. Now early Christianity, the mystical writings were in Greek. They're called the Greek fathers. They lived in the deserts of Palestine, Egypt, and so forth. And there's some amazing writings from that patristic period. So what is the oldest of the Christian terms for the no self experience? Wait a minute. I think that's an omega. Sorry, I think I misspelled it. Not an omicron, but I could be wrong. I should really check these things out before I present them to the world. Kenosis. If we were to Romanize it, K-E-N-O-S-I-S. And osis doesn't mean a disease, by the way. It means a process. And kenos in Greek means empty. Interestingly, directly cognate to the Sanskrit word shunya. Because the k sound, the veller stop, the voiceless veller stop of the k sound in Proto-Indo-European became a sha, which is a palatalized s in Sanskrit. So actually Sanskrit is modified from the early Proto-Indo-European. Greek still preserves the k sound. So kenos in Greek is a direct Indo-European cognate of shunya in Sanskrit. And interesting, similar spiritual interpretation. Kenosis is the process of emptying out, emptying out of somethingness that the Christian meditators sought. And if you could achieve a deep enough kenosis, then you would be able to experience theosis, which means godding, literally. See, Greek is a very subtle language. There's two words in God, two words in Greek, theosis and apotheosis. Apotheosis is deification in the sense that the ancient Roman emperors claimed to be gods. But theosis is deification in the sense that the Christian who empties themselves out takes on divine attributes, not infinite power and that kind of thing, but the goodness, the compassion, and so forth. So you become more godlike in that sense. And culminating in, talk about a subtle use of language and an interesting word, the culmination of kenosis, according to the Greek desert fathers, is to become isochristos. ISO, you know what that means in Greek? It means equivalent. Isochristos is Christ equivalent. Now I like to very irreverently translate that into modern English as you experience what it's like to be nano Christ, a very, very, very miniature version of dying in order to be of service to others. Your own personal version as opposed to the cosmic version, which is like that would be the mega Christ. Okay, so kenosis. So now we've got Islam, Judaism, Christianity, the Western religions. Let's go to Buddhism. So just to put it in an Indic script for the fun of it. This is Devanagari, which is the North Indian alphabet used to write Sanskrit, Hindi, and such. But I just wrote a Pali word in it. Anatta, A-N-A-T-T-A. And this is the famous doctrine of the Buddha, no self as thing. That gets translated into various Asian languages. Let's start with Tibetan. Screwed that up. Let's redo it. Not pretty. In Tibetan, it's called Takme or Tame. If you romanize it, B-D-A-G dot M-E-D and another dot. But it's pronounced Takme. And it literally means self and M-E-D means without or not. So that just directly translates. In East Asia, you've got Chinese characters as the classical language. So that's how you write it. And it exactly corresponds. Now, there's four cultures that constitute the sphere of the influence of Chinese characters. Traditionally, those four cultures are, of course, China itself, Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. So there's local pronunciations for this. Let's go down the list. In Mandarin Chinese, it would be pronounced Wu-Wa. Wu means not existent or does not exist and Wa is self. So that's exactly like Takme in Tibetan. In Vietnamese pronunciation, same characters are pronounced Vo-Nga. Vietnamese has a very peculiar creaky tone unique to it. Vo-Nga. You can hear the tones, right? Vietnamese and Chinese are both tonal languages. So in Mandarin Chinese, it's a rising tone and then a dipping tone. Wu-Wa. And in Vietnamese, you can hear similar, Vo-Nga. Well, let's write it in Korean script. Koreans have their own alphabet. I could be wrong about this. My Korean is very rusty, but I'm pretty, I think it's Mu-Ah. M-U-A. But I know for sure what it is in Japanese. Similar sounding. Japanese also have their own syllabary. Kana. Mu-Ga. M-U-G-A. The Taoist also had a term for the nothingness of the liberated person. It's another Chinese word meaning emptiness, actually. This character here, which is pronounced Xu. And that's sort of the Taoist equivalent. So there we have sort of the world of the humility to the vanishing point as cultivated in the Western and Eastern traditions.</p>
