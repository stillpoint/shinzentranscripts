<p>However, it may be that the object of situation is not caused by suffering or that that doesn't weigh very large, that other factors are large, and that there's not a cure. It doesn't get cured. You stay sick or you get worse. There's also the term, the term of the disease, which is called the disease of the heart. There's not a cure. It doesn't get cured. You stay sick or you get worse. There's also the genetic factors, too, that may be just strongly weighted, not in favor of a cure. That's right. What are you going to do? Well, now you can't actually maybe do something with gene therapy and what have you. But my point is that even if you had gene therapy, sooner or later, something's going to get you. If you learn the techniques that reduce your suffering, perhaps in addition to learning the techniques that are designed to specifically change the course. That's why I say that the two can go in parallel. You do whatever interventional medicine you do to change the course. You use whatever mind-focusing techniques you can relate to, or consciousness-focusing techniques, better than that, to change the course, to actually objectively impact the disease, the health situation, the injury, whatever it may be. Let's do all of that, certainly. But there are these other things that we can do that are designed to do that as maybe a nice byproduct. But they're primarily designed to reduce suffering, no matter what's going on. Why do I like to start with that? Well, number one, it may have an impact objectively on the disease. Number two, even if it doesn't, you're okay. Since sooner or later, something's going to happen that can't be changed. Often, when people are diagnosed with cancer, they're in a fear state for quite a while. So anything that will reduce that fear state is also going to be beneficial. I think you said that some of the researchers that you respect say that it's actually that fear state that may be a primary. Right. Dr. Hammer is a German medical doctor who developed a medicine he calls German New Medicine, which is… German? German New Medicine, which is… Deutsche Neue Mediziner? I'm guessing. My German isn't that good. He believes that all cancers are caused by an abrupt, unexpected shock that the person has gone through that needs to be resolved and expressed. They got hammered? They got hammered, that's right. He calls it a hammerhead. Really? Hammer shirt, I think he calls it hammer shirt, yes. It's the resolution of that shock that he believes will help to promote healing. If we can reduce your suffering, it's good two ways. It may also improve your objective conditions. Many people, both in the alternative medicine and in standard medicine, would agree with that general premise. But also, just in case nothing can help, this will help. Your physical discomfort doesn't go away, but your suffering does. I like the idea that a person would acquire at least one technique that will do that for them, because sooner or later they're going to need it. Let's talk about the techniques that reduce suffering. How do we suffer? We suffer because of uncomfortable physical sensations. We suffer because of uncomfortable emotional sensations. Both of those are body events. We suffer because of negative mental images and negative judgmental talk. We might say that there are uncomfortable physical and emotional body states and uncomfortable visual and auditory mental states. Sure. In Dr. Hammer's model, those would be all there from that initial conflict or shock. They would still be there. Yes, because you've got the mental images of what could happen. You've got the, Oh my God, Oh my God, and the why me and the poor me in your talk space. You've got the fear in your body and you've got the physical discomfort in your body constantly re-initiating. Right, remembering. Reusing those three to arise moment by moment by way of reaction. Sure. Let's call that whole, let's use another word, German word, Gestalt. That whole constellation of uncomfortable sensation in the body, which could be physical pain, it could be fatigue, it could be nausea, it could be heat, lots of things people get, right? Sure, yeah. Those are all physical type sensations. Then you've got your mental and emotional reactions. We'll call that whole Gestalt or that whole constellation of body-mind distress the sensory challenge. Meditation techniques can be divided into two categories. The ones that have you focus away from the sensory challenge, not in a way to suppress it or deny it, but simply in a way that you're focusing away from it. On to what? Pleasant restful experiences. Who was it? One of them, what was the one? Dr. Mears. Mears, okay. Yeah. Okay, different kinds of cool out, mellow out. You can focus away from the sensory challenge, the uncomfortable body-mind states. You can focus away on the pleasant restful states. We can teach you, we meaning the meditation teachers of the world, can teach you actually a wide range of different ways of focusing on pleasant restful states. Another way to focus away from the sensory challenge is to focus on positive mental images, positive internal talk, positive emotional feelings in your body. That's what Lauren LeShan really had people to do with his suggestions. He suggested that cancer patients find and create the life that gives them the greatest fulfillment, meaning and joy, and had them focus on making that manifest as quickly as possible for themselves. They would do that through image and talk. They would also actually go out and create it. For instance, there was a woman who was bedridden in a hospital who had always loved the opera. Her family members brought her newspaper articles historically about the New York opera, and she wrote a book while she was in her hospital bed about the opera and lived twice as long as they did. That gave meaning to her life. Sure. One thing that you can do is focus on pleasant restful states. Another is you can focus on positive image, positive talk, positive emotion. There's even other things you can do. You can anchor yourself in pleasant sights and sounds, like focus on music. Right. All of those would be ways that you can use your attention to focus away from the sensory challenge without denying or suppressing the sensory challenge. That's important, not to suppress what you're feeling. That's right. There's a whole range of strategies that I call focus away strategies.
