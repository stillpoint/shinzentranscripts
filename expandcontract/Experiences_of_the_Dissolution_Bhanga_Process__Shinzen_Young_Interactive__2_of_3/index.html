<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>If you think of the spiritual journey as a journey from surface to source, in making that journey, some people will have blissful dissolution, that they just sort of dissolve back into the flow and go of the source. Some people have these horrific dissolutions that if they can stay with it, then become blissful and eventually just purely blissful. Some people get a mixture of both, and some are not particularly aware of going through a dissolution process, so it's not required. I do talk about these things and other teachers talk about them because we want to give you the heads up, just in case it happens to you. Basically, you need to know two things, why is this happening and what am I going to do about it? So we do talk about it. The advantage is that if it does happen, you know why it's happening and what to do about it. But the disadvantage is, if we talk about it, some people listening will say, that hasn't happened to me yet, so I must be the child of a lesser god, I'm not really making progress. They're not missing that. Well, it depends. Not always as rough as you had. People think, well, I haven't experienced that so I must not be making progress, so there's that problem. And then other people think, oh my god, I hope that doesn't happen to me, and there's that problem. And then other people are thinking, wow, I wish that would happen to me. There are problems involved in explicitly talking about these phenomena. It scares people or it creates craving or comparison mind. But I think it's still worth talking about. Definitely. Get it out there. Because I think if you wouldn't have been there, I would have gone for psychiatric help. And that could have had tragic consequences because... They may not have understood. There's actually something called the Spiritual Emergence Network, you know about this, that was created because they realized people who were having spiritual experiences didn't have someone to talk to. They go into the mental health system, while those mental health professionals in prior times didn't know about this stuff. And the Spiritual Emergence Network was designed to inform mental health professionals that hey, just because somebody's reporting the kind of things you're reporting doesn't necessarily mean they're losing their marbles and that they necessarily need to be put in chemical restraints. I can see the importance of that. You know, there could have been horrific consequences or tragic consequences if you had gotten somebody that didn't understand the difference between dissolution and insanity. I would say the single most important thing if a person goes through an experience like this is you've got to have somebody to talk to who's actually themselves been through it. I made it through to the other end. That's like, that's the cure. Okay, more than anything it's like, okay, find somebody who's actually experienced this. Then they'll take you through it. Isn't that what I said I would do? And you're more or less through it, aren't you? I mean, you had a little recurrence today, but... It's taken on a different texture.
